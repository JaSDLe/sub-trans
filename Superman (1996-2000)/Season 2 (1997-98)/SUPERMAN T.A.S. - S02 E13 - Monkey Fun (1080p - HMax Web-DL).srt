1
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,572
Play the song, Lois. Play it.

2
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,740
You wanna hear Beppo sing, Titano?

3
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,388
Okay, here goes.

4
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,143
Daddy's here!

5
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,841
Hello, Lucy. Have you three been having fun?

6
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:13,349
Lois, honey, it's time.

7
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,757
No. No. I won't let you take him.

8
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,093
But, Lois, you knew one day Titano would have to leave us.

9
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,858
He has to go on his mission now.

10
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:24,765
Why can't you send Lucy into space instead?

11
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,998
- I'll go. - It's Titano's job, honey.

12
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:30,165
That's why he was able to come live with us.

13
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:33,278
Colonel Lane? I'm sorry, but...

14
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,911
I understand. Go ahead, gentlemen.

15
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,617
No. No.

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,221
Don't worry, honey.

17
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:51,489
Daddy promises Titano is going to be just fine.

18
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:29,525
So, colonel, how are your cadets enjoying the launch?

19
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,968
Fine, sir, though my oldest is still a bit concerned about Titano.

20
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:36,040
No need to be, my dear. That little monkey's got the might...

21
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,440
and brainpower of the greatest nation on Earth behind him.

22
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:50,580
The booster misfired. We're losing contact, general.

23
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,037
We lost him.

24
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:11,641
Titano.

25
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:26,091
The meteor storm is right where you said it would be, professor...

26
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,921
larger than life and headed straight for the space station.

27
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,063
<i>- I'm going in.</i> - Happy hunting.

28
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:52,075
<i>Superman, come in. Are you all right?</i>

29
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,979
I set off some kind of chain reaction.

30
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,425
Superman to S.T.A.R., cleanup's all done.

31
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:39,296
And I'm bringing you back a little surprise.

32
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,092
- How's he doing? - Well, he's alive, and that's a miracle.

33
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,569
But he's been lethargic since he woke up.

34
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:50,504
You'd think after 20 years he'd be a little hungry.

35
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:54,306
According to the records, he's twice as heavy as he was when they launched him.

36
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,947
Titano.

37
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:58,774
Remember me? Lo-Lo?

38
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,621
- Lo-Lo? - I was 8, okay?

39
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:13,432
Oh, my pretty little baby. You do remember. Oh, yes, you do.

40
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:19,364
That's the most life we've seen out of him yet.

41
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:20,836
Baby hungry?

42
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,135
Looks like you're just what the doctor ordered, Lo-Lo.

43
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:27,939
Yes, I'd say resuming your old relationship with Titano...

44
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:30,480
- would do him a world of good. - What do you...?

45
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,916
Oh, wait. I have a job, a crazy schedule and a tiny apartment.

46
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:36,988
You can't expect me to...

47
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,257
No, Titano, put down that vase.

48
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,654
Give me back the remote.

49
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:44,558
Come down from there!

50
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:49,668
Sure was easier to have a monkey in the house when Mom did the cleaning.

51
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,424
"My Life with Titano," by Lois Lane.

52
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,288
With photos by the esteemed Jimmy Olsen.

53
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:21,264
What life with Titano? I haven't been out since he got here.

54
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,761
Jimmy? Think you could keep an eye on him for an hour or two?

55
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:29,430
- Me? - You've got to take the photos anyway.

56
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:32,008
- And I know they'll be terrific. - But...

57
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:35,838
It's just like babysitting. With fleas.

58
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,677
Great.

59
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,192
Take a look, Superman. You might find this interesting.

60
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,522
Gas pockets in the meteor fragments.

61
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:53,290
Could the gas have caused Titano's suspended state?

62
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:55,957
Possibly. We're running tests right now.

63
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,362
That came from the lab.

64
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,439
- Look out! - They're growing.

65
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,009
Move!

66
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,966
- What are those things? - Bacteria.

67
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,905
They must have been trapped in the jars with the meteor gas.

68
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:15,878
The exposure to our atmosphere somehow caused this tremendous growth.

69
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:18,881
- Oh, good heavens. - Titano.

70
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,884
Lois, you've gotta get back here. Right now.

71
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:25,546
Jimmy, I haven't been gone 20 minutes. Just throw him a banana.

72
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:28,215
I don't think that's gonna be enough.

73
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,862
Hello? Jimmy?

74
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,397
Hello? Back to the monkey house.

75
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:37,224
Good Titano. Nice Titano.

76
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,768
That's right. You eat.

77
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:53,812
That's it. I'm out of here.

78
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,802
Superman. Hey, you're not gonna believe...

79
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,770
Let me guess. Titano's a growing boy.

80
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,778
Hey, where'd he go?

81
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:31,516
Okay, Jimmy. What's the big...

82
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,829
Look, Mommy. Monkey.

83
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,532
Yes, dear. There's lots of monkeys.

84
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,872
No, big monkey.

85
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,879
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

86
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,310
All right, Cheetah. You asked for it.

87
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,955
Bad monkey. Bad, bad monkey!

88
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:43,817
Criminals, madmen and aliens we can handle, but this?

89
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:47,049
Don't sweat it, Maggie. These babies will put anything to sleep.

90
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,490
Nighty-night, monkey boy.

91
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,036
That was a short nap.

92
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:53,583
I'm sorry, Lois, but your monkey friend's going down.

93
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:59,991
Don't hurt him! He's just a baby!

94
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,925
Okay, a really big baby.

95
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:07,736
- Hello? - Lois, I left for Metropolis...

96
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:10,272
as soon as I saw the news. Are you all right?

97
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,774
<i>Daddy? I'm okay, but...</i>

98
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:15,937
Listen, I've got something I think might calm Titano.

99
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:32,686
Where are the helicopters with the gas?

100
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,086
Can't bring them in yet.

101
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:36,853
He won't sit still long enough for gas to work.

102
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,020
Right now Superman's our best hope.

103
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,539
I'll take it from here, Dad.

104
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:05,555
Titano! Titano, look!

105
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:10,088
Lois, get out of here!

106
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,790
Oh, no. I don't believe this.

107
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,795
Beppo? Oh, Beppo? Where are you?

108
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,033
- Oh, no! - He's coming closer.

109
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,415
You're sure it's in here?

110
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:17,323
Yes, I'm sure. So shut up and keep squeezing the monkeys.

111
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:37,075
Bingo.

112
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,423
What the...?

113
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,693
- Is it over? - Let's get out of here.

114
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,021
It's okay. We got him.

115
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,483
He should be fine here, Lois.

116
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,884
Now that S.T.A.R. Labs stopped his growth spurts.

117
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:27,149
I guess I have to say goodbye again.

118
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:30,260
Though this time, I don't think I'll miss him quite as much.

119
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,594
