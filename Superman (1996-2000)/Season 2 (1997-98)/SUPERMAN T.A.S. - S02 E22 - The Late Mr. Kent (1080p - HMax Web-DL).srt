1
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:14,803
He's in a better place now...

2
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:18,379
where he'll be rewarded for the kindness and thoughtfulness...

3
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,572
he showed so many of you.

4
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:22,445
I didn't know him myself...

5
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,944
but based on what I've heard...

6
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:27,679
I wish I'd been lucky enough to have met him.

7
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,839
He seems to have led an exemplary life

8
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:34,319
filled with courage, dedication and modesty.

9
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,794
<i>Luck.</i>

10
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,196
<i>That's what it boils down to, doesn't it?</i>

11
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,161
<i>The smallest break one way or the other.</i>

12
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:43,465
<i>It can save a life or destroy one.</i>

13
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:45,497
<i>And you can't fight it...</i>

14
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,471
<i>no matter how strong you are.</i>

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,469
But we mustn't let this tragedy dominate our memories of him.

16
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:55,112
We mustn't forget the good times and warm feelings we have...

17
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,810
for a colleague and a friend named...

18
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,785
Clark Kent.

19
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,950
<i>It seems like an eternity now.</i>

20
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:06,655
<i>A few days ago, Perry asked me to interview Ernest Walker.</i>

21
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:10,455
<i>He was a smalltime thief who was convicted of murdering a woman...</i>

22
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:14,297
<i>during a burglary five years ago. He'd soon pay the ultimate price.</i>

23
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:18,601
I'm telling you, I wasn't there. I never touched her. I never saw her.

24
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:21,106
- I didn't take nothing! - But, Ernie...

25
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:25,475
- you tried to fence the victim's necklace. - I found it outside my door!

26
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:27,014
It was a setup.

27
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:30,812
Look, Mr. Kent, I stole. Yeah, lots of times...

28
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:33,217
but I never hurt no one. Never.

29
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:34,888
You gotta believe me.

30
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,957
You're my last hope.

31
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:39,189
<i>His heartbeat was steady.</i>

32
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,227
<i>His eyes never wavered.</i>

33
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,865
<i>I was beginning to wonder.</i>

34
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,767
There you go, Kent. The file on the Walker case...

35
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,404
and the trial transcript.

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,671
Thanks.

37
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:55,305
Kent, a word of advice:

38
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:58,879
Walker's got a rap sheet longer than my tie.

39
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:01,172
I know. I was on the case.

40
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,216
Don't lose too much sleep.

41
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,692
<i>Halfway through the transcript...</i>

42
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:19,130
<i>I was starting to think Detective Bowman was right.</i>

43
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,432
Give it a rest, Smallville. Time for dinner.

44
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:23,832
Can't, Lois.

45
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,032
Only a couple of days left before...

46
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,609
Before what? They execute a killer?

47
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,936
Everyone knows he did it, Clark.

48
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:33,207
Everyone thinks he did it, Jimmy.

49
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:36,147
Come on, kid. He's a sucker for lost causes.

50
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,412
Let's get some burgers.

51
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,219
<i>Dinner was hard to pass up.</i>

52
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:43,950
<i>I hadn't eaten all day.</i>

53
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:45,526
<i>Not that I needed to.</i>

54
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,719
<i>But old habits die hard.</i>

55
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:53,328
<i>I figured Ron Troupe wouldn't mind if I got rid of his leftovers.</i>

56
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,368
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

57
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:11,477
<i>On the night of the murder...</i>

58
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:14,885
<i>Walker claimed he was home alone watching TV, eating pizza.</i>

59
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,490
<i>Not much of an alibi...</i>

60
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:20,288
<i>but his public defender didn't even bother to follow up.</i>

61
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,963
<i>I found the place closest to his old apartment...</i>

62
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:30,698
<i>and prayed the delivery boy had a good memory.</i>

63
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,403
Five years ago? Forget about it!

64
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:37,740
I'm lucky if a delivery boy lasts five days.

65
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,712
Is there anyone else here who might remember?

66
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,684
Excuse me.

67
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,144
Round Th' Clock Pizza.

68
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,415
Yeah.

69
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:52,027
Yeah. I got your address right here, Mr. Caan.

70
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:53,787
Be there in half an hour.

71
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:59,297
Tell me, did you have that computer five years ago?

72
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:03,166
Yeah, but we purge the database of old customers every year.

73
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,534
Walker wouldn't be on...

74
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:07,940
Wait a second.

75
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:18,781
We got backup disks somewhere.

76
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:20,582
There.

77
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:28,256
Walker's deliveries could be on these...

78
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,592
along with a million others.

79
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:35,733
<i>It looked like I was gonna lose some sleep after all.</i>

80
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:43,870
- Hello. <i>- Hey.</i>

81
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:45,605
<i>Score one for the sucker.</i>

82
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:46,781
Kent?

83
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:48,708
I found Walker's alibi.

84
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,786
It's all here on a little computer disk.

85
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:55,550
You can clear Walker? What? How?

86
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,892
Sorry, Lois. I gotta make a quick trip to the governor.

87
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,054
You can read all about it in the afternoon edition.

88
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,605
<i>According to the computer disk, Walker got his pizza...</i>

89
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:14,607
<i>almost the exact moment the murder was committed...</i>

90
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,442
<i>which proved he was innocent.</i>

91
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:27,383
<i>I could have flown to the governor as Superman and given him the disk...</i>

92
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:30,048
<i>but that could have raised some questions.</i>

93
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:33,155
<i>Maybe there was some ego involved too.</i>

94
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:36,389
<i>I wanted this to be Clark's victory, not Superman's.</i>

95
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,598
<i>I had to get out of the water and get back as Kent...</i>

96
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,793
<i>but there was one little problem.</i>

97
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,036
<i>If the fisherman saw me come out as Superman...</i>

98
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,841
<i>he'd know my secret.</i>

99
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,912
<i>I was in hot water, all right. But more importantly...</i>

100
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:37,651
<i>how was I going to save Walker without the evidence?</i>

101
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:58,346
Who else but the real killer would have done this?

102
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,922
- He was afraid Kent was getting too close. - Kent was a reporter.

103
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:06,256
Who knows how many enemies he had? This might come as a kick in the pants...

104
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:08,727
but nobody likes you guys.

105
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:11,900
Any sign of him?

106
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,502
- What if he made it to shore? - From that?

107
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,670
He could have gotten blown out.

108
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,141
Then where is he?

109
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:25,804
Maybe he's lying low. I mean, someone did try to kill him.

110
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,745
Lane, listen. See that guy?

111
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,182
He was out there fishing at the time. He saw the whole thing.

112
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:33,845
When Kent's car went down, nothing came up...

113
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,820
except the bubbles.

114
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,059
Mind if I ask him a few questions?

115
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,960
If it gets you off my back.

116
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:47,366
All right, everyone, let's not waste too much time here.

117
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:51,439
I think it's a sure bet we've seen the last of Mr. Clark Kent.

118
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,738
Yes, detective, I heard you.

119
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,576
My son's car blew up and went into the ocean.

120
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,408
But are you sure you understand?

121
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,413
I mean, this is serious.

122
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,712
I know. I guess the shock just hasn't set in yet.

123
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:08,517
If you hear anything else, give us a jingle. Bye, now.

124
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,319
Well, this is a fine mess.

125
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:16,226
It's not like he's really dead, Martha. He just can't be Clark anymore.

126
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,429
But I am Clark. I need to be Clark.

127
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,730
I'd go crazy if I had to be Superman all the time.

128
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,301
There must be a way to bring back our boy.

129
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:28,876
I don't see how. Not with an eyewitness and all.

130
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:31,570
Don't forget, there's someone else to consider.

131
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,651
<i>Pa was right. I still had to help Walker. I</i>

132
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:37,479
<i>couldn't let his friends go through this...</i>

133
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:41,886
<i>even if it meant that I had to tell the world that Clark Kent is Superman.</i>

134
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,430
<i>Well, so much for sentiment.</i>

135
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,179
<i>I figured I'd change into Clark one last time...</i>

136
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,791
<i>and go to the governor and tell my story.</i>

137
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,023
<i>If he asked me how I survived the wreck? Well, I was ready to show him.</i>

138
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,351
What are you doing here?

139
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:55,559
Same as you, I imagine.

140
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,326
Trying to figure out who killed Clark Kent.

141
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,636
He told me he had some evidence on a disk.

142
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:03,567
I was hoping he'd made a backup.

143
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,564
Wish I'd thought of that.

144
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,905
Wouldn't have done any good. Clark's computer is gone.

145
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,436
Somebody's been through here.

146
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:14,173
Apparently, but look what they left.

147
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,045
I found it in Clark's phone.

148
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,018
A bug. I've seen others just like this one.

149
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,349
Lois?

150
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:32,565
I always teased him.

151
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,365
But I had so much respect.

152
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,943
And I liked him too. I really did.

153
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,169
Wish I'd told him.

154
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,076
Well, maybe he'll show up yet.

155
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,109
I thought for sure he would...

156
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:52,880
especially after I talked to that so-called eyewitness.

157
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,455
- The fisherman? - Yeah.

158
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:57,616
I found out he has 20/200 eyesight.

159
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:01,059
He wasn't wearing his glasses. It's a wonder he saw the ocean.

160
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,789
Then Clark could have made it to shore after all.

161
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:07,197
Yeah, but he would have contacted someone by now.

162
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,998
That's the real proof he's dead.

163
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,479
Superman!

164
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,621
Bowman.

165
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:48,899
Detective Bowman? I need to talk to you a minute.

166
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,062
What do you want, Lane? I'm busy.

167
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,764
You're the busiest cop on the force, aren't you?

168
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,570
You were the lead detective on the Walker case.

169
00:13:56,744 --> 00:14:00,943
- You caught him fencing the necklace. - Good police work, that's all.

170
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,778
Good? I think it's downright unbelievable.

171
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:10,047
Like how you were the first cop at Clark's wreck.

172
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:14,161
Tonight, you just happened to be near his apartment when the bomb went off.

173
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:15,184
Coincidence.

174
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:17,924
The bug in his phone wasn't a coincidence.

175
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:21,069
It's the same model you cops use for wiretaps.

176
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,966
I don't know anything about it.

177
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,833
Come on, detective.

178
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,003
Just between you, me and the wall.

179
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,150
You framed Walker. You killed that woman, made him a scapegoat.

180
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,087
And when Clark started looking into it, you put a bomb in his car.

181
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:47,588
And tonight, you burned his place, just in case he'd hidden evidence there.

182
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,755
Keep talking, lady. I smell a big libel suit.

183
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,591
Not when we see whose fingerprints are on this.

184
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:59,772
Give me that.

185
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,669
Hey! Let go!

186
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,188
What took you?

187
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:23,923
You were going to get Bowman to incriminate himself, remember?

188
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:25,657
I think this qualifies.

189
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,069
<i>But it wasn't over yet.</i>

190
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:17,605
<i>Luck still had to play its part.</i>

191
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,037
He's not here? We've got the real killer.

192
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:25,448
I'm sorry. At the last minute, the governor decided to attend the execution.

193
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,588
It is an election year.

194
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,860
We barely had time for him to make the phone call.

195
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:02,918
No!

196
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,296
- What's going on? - What's going on?

197
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,366
- It's Superman. - Somebody stop him!

198
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,196
The gas!

199
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,960
Great story, Lois.

200
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:52,266
Thanks, Jimmy. But the fun's sure gone out of it.

201
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,136
I know what you mean.

202
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,205
Lane here.

203
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,312
What?!

204
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,818
After I swam to shore, I guess I must have found a phone...

205
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:13,483
and called Lana.

206
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,064
You've been sitting here in the lap of luxury while I'm out risking my neck.

207
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,791
He was recuperating.

208
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:23,529
Poor thing. When I picked him up, he could barely remember his name.

209
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:27,807
But he sure remembered yours and your telephone number.

210
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,500
Clark and I go back a long way.

211
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,543
Are you jealous?

212
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,049
Yeah. Jealous of his endless luck.

213
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,771
It's time.

214
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,588
How did he survive that car bomb? How?

215
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,018
He's Superman!

216
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,022
