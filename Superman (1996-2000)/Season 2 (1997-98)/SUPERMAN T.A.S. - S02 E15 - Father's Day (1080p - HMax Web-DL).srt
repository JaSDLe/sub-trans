1
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,893
City desk? This is Lois Lane.

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,120
Hit the record button and take all this down.

3
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,197
I'm in Crestview Park on the west side...

4
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:20,697
and this thing from outer space has just landed.

5
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,437
I don't know what it is, but it doesn't look user-friendly.

6
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:36,681
- You got plans this weekend, Clark? - I'm playing tour guide for my folks.

7
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,751
They're coming to town for Father's Day.

8
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,147
What's their ETA?

9
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,820
<i>Call the SCU. Get them down here. Fast.</i>

10
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,957
Your mom and dad. What time are they...?

11
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:48,751
Clark?

12
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,142
Lois, get back.

13
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:46,278
He's ripping it apart.

14
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:48,347
Transmit the destruct code.

15
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:50,278
- Now. - Yes, sire!

16
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,785
- That doesn't look too encouraging. - No, it doesn't.

17
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,128
Superman.

18
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:13,034
My scream machine is a success, great Darkseid.

19
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:14,469
Is it?

20
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:17,509
A success in gauging Superman's strength.

21
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:22,547
Using this data, I can now construct the ultimate device to destroy him and...

22
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:26,379
That was your ultimate device, Desaad. You have failed me.

23
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,716
Please, sire. All my years of service to you.

24
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,482
Send me back to Earth, Darkseid.

25
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:35,652
Let me put Intergang back together. I've learned a lot here on Apokolips.

26
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:39,659
No one gets the chance to fail me twice, Mr. Manheim.

27
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:43,468
Give me the opportunity to prove myself, sire.

28
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,003
Let me destroy Superman for you.

29
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,402
- No, Kalibak. - But...

30
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,943
The destruction of Superman is too important to my plans.

31
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:54,671
I cannot entrust it to you.

32
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:58,582
As you wish, great Darkseid.

33
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:04,752
How can he even take that gorilla seriously?

34
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:08,554
No one questions my judgment, Mr. Manheim.

35
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:11,027
Least of all you.

36
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,836
To work.

37
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,885
Kalibak. You do not have to accept your rejection.

38
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:45,790
I can send you to Earth to destroy Superman.

39
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,135
And cover your failure, worm?

40
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:52,602
Well, technically. But if you were to succeed...

41
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,297
Darkseid would honor you.

42
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:58,138
- You would be his favorite. - Yes.

43
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:01,813
It is only right that you claim all the glory...

44
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:04,917
for this great deed. Do not even mention that I suggested it.

45
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:11,151
Are you certain?

46
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,991
Trust me, Kalibak.

47
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,255
Darkseid will finally accept you as his son.

48
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:31,335
Your father's thinking of buying a computer for the farm.

49
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,902
I am not. I don't need some fancy gizmo...

50
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,445
to tell me when the chickens have to be fed.

51
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:38,810
It's your mother who wants one.

52
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:42,009
She's aching to surf the net, whatever that means.

53
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:46,787
When I finish a story, I press a button and it goes straight to the editor's desk.

54
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,227
Heck. That could save you five or six whole steps.

55
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:53,330
Ah, but the editor can send it directly to typography...

56
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:57,025
seven flights down, and they can send it to the press room, and...

57
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,635
Okay, okay. I surrender.

58
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:00,202
This is Lois Lane, folks.

59
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,134
Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Kent.

60
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,366
Please, Jonathan and Martha.

61
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,533
We've heard so much about you from Clark.

62
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,874
- Really? - We feel like you're practically family.

63
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,310
Will you join us for lunch?

64
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:15,141
Well, seeing as I'm practically family, why not?

65
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,346
Kent! My office. Now.

66
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,290
On my way, chief.

67
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:23,825
You all go ahead to the restaurant. I'll meet you in a few minutes.

68
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:28,929
No hurry, Clark. I'm sure Lois and I have a lot to talk about.

69
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,897
Your editor wasn't angry with Clark, was he?

70
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:33,697
He certainly sounded upset.

71
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:38,206
No. The chief always sounds like that. It's part of his charm.

72
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,890
My goodness. This place looks expensive.

73
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,400
- Clark shouldn't have... - Oh, hush, Martha.

74
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,163
Let the boy indulge us if he wants.

75
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:20,513
Is it true Superman is often seen in this part of the city?

76
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,248
- Yes, sir. - Good.

77
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,889
Hurry! Before the roof comes down.

78
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,423
Somebody should take that bruiser down a peg.

79
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,906
Jonathan!

80
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,505
What was that?!

81
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:32,418
I can't see a thing, but it sounded like a bomb to me.

82
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,615
Kent. Get down there and find out what...

83
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:47,396
Superman. Clark Kent's father... still inside.

84
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,800
Are you two all right?

85
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,141
Yes. Go save Jonathan.

86
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,506
And be careful!

87
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:06,817
Don't move. I'm coming.

88
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,357
The only place you're going is to the grave.

89
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,355
Stop! There's an innocent man.

90
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,527
How naive you are.

91
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:19,295
On Apokolips we are taught even as children that no one is innocent.

92
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,704
You see, Superman, life breeds death.

93
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,681
Anything that lives must kill something to survive.

94
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,546
And I am a survivor.

95
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,055
Whoever you are...

96
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,453
My name is Kalibak.

97
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,223
I'll settle with you in a moment.

98
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:54,057
I seem to recall telling Kalibak he was not to go to Earth.

99
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,223
I was just about to tell you, sire. He has disobeyed you.

100
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,462
I know now where he comes by such foolish ideas.

101
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:02,804
Oh?

102
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:06,436
He wishes to prove himself worthy to be your...

103
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,677
A technicality of his birth.

104
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:13,172
As far as destiny and I are concerned, I have no son.

105
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:37,063
There are people on that train.

106
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,537
Maybe hundreds of them.

107
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:41,042
More of your innocents?

108
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,235
Clear out. Now.

109
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,322
Not again...

110
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,929
The destruction of Superman is too important to my plans.

111
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:17,471
I cannot entrust it to you.

112
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,869
Entrust it to you.

113
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,373
To you, to you.

114
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:35,216
- Clark. Look out! - Clark? Where...?

115
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:30,340
Now, with your death, I shall prove my worthiness...

116
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:32,777
- to my father. - Father?

117
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,419
No!

118
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,036
So is this my Father's Day present?

119
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:46,216
Honestly, Jonathan. You've got more nerve than sense.

120
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:48,448
He tried to stand up to that big brute...

121
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:50,855
- all by himself. - Speaking of whom...

122
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:57,923
No matter how many times I see that, I'll never get used to it.

123
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,864
Me neither.

124
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,031
Sire, I know I disobeyed you...

125
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,729
but I thought if I could destroy Superman...

126
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:42,006
- And did you? - I underestimated his strength...

127
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,146
but he won't catch me off guard again.

128
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:47,305
That much, at least, is true.

129
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,583
Please, Father!

130
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:56,315
You'll beg louder than that when I'm done with you.

131
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,729
What have you done to him?

132
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,499
I asked you a question.

133
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:10,896
Who are you?

134
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,267
Answer me.

135
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:35,358
That is who I am.

136
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:42,129
And when the time comes, you and this primitive planet...

137
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:44,899
will swear allegiance to Darkseid.

138
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,566
Or you will be destroyed.

139
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,502
Great Darkseid, I do not understand.

140
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,638
Why did you let Superman live?

141
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:19,271
Superman cannot be destroyed with one stroke.

142
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:22,108
But it can and will be done.

143
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:25,270
You sacrificed your son... Uh, Kalibak?

144
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:27,940
One casualty.

145
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:32,378
How many will there be before you destroy Superman...

146
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:33,886
and conquer the Earth?

147
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:38,052
As many as it takes.

148
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,917
