1
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:19,743
McGurk! McGurk! Where are you?

2
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:24,758
Look at that crazy little man.

3
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:26,740
He'll be killed!

4
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:32,751
Hey, McGurk, I'm losing my patience here!

5
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:35,742
Uhh!

6
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:39,736
Ah!

7
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:44,724
Confusing, ain't it?

8
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,735
Ha, ha, ha!

9
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:00,755
What's so funny, Jimmy?

10
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,728
Ha, ha, ha!

11
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:05,741
Check out the new comic strip.

12
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:18,720
What a riot.

13
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,755
Mr. Mixel-plick?

14
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:25,724
No! Repeat after me, bright boy.

15
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:31,713
It's Mix... yezz... Spit!

16
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:32,746
Lick.

17
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:38,718
Hey, have you seen McGurk?

18
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,732
McGurk?

19
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:44,748
Hold it.

20
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,710
Did you see him?

21
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,726
- Who? - That weird little man.

22
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,714
He was right here.

23
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:54,721
Uh... yeah.

24
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:55,725
Do me a favor, Kent

25
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:57,709
crack up after we've covered

26
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:58,741
the museum opening.

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,715
And now we are proud to present... McGurk!

28
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:06,717
Oh, no.

29
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,709
Uh, this classic sculpture

30
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,722
by one of the world's most noted artists...

31
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:13,725
McGurk!

32
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:15,718
Where are you, McGurk?

33
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,751
Come on, it's getting late!

34
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,727
How do you like that guy, standing me up like this?

35
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,714
Be quiet.

36
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,709
Listen, you.

37
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,853
And what is he doing here?

38
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:29,751
If we may continue.

39
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:31,721
And here now at last

40
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,728
the showpiece of our exhibit..

41
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:38,725
Rodin's Thinker.

42
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,709
That's him!

43
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:41,727
Hey, McGurk, finish your business

44
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:43,735
and let's get going.

45
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:47,730
Huh? Oh, sorry, Mix.

46
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,715
Hold it right there, little friend.

47
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,724
I want some answers.

48
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:05,743
McGurk, get rid of this bum.

49
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:11,706
You heard my pal.

50
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,743
- Scram! - Unh!

51
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:17,735
If that's the way you want to play it.

52
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,715
Superman?

53
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:31,740
He's ruined the statue!

54
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:35,711
I didn't mean.. Sorry.

55
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:36,717
It was..

56
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,728
The little man?

57
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,721
It's been going on all week.

58
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:43,714
Impossible things keep happening,

59
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,709
and I'm the only one who ever sees them.

60
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:46,717
Am I going nuts?

61
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,714
Oh, Clark, I'm sure it's not as bad as that.

62
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:53,704
I can't go on being Superman if I keep flipping out.

63
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:54,718
Now take it easy, son.

64
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:57,707
There's a perfectly logical explanation for all this.

65
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,702
Yes. It's obvious.

66
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:00,715
A brilliant, godlike life form

67
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,710
from a dimension twice removed from ours

68
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,706
is testing your powers.

69
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,713
What makes you say that?

70
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,705
Ho ho. That's not important, Clark.

71
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,701
What really matters is following through

72
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,740
with a nice, firm peck when scratching up corn.

73
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:26,717
Ma?

74
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,724
Pa?

75
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,739
No!

76
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,705
Chickens are always funny

77
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,722
though personally, I prefer ducks.

78
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,733
Or ostriches.

79
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:55,738
Or just for the sake of novelty..

80
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:05,721
Ooh, I've never seen those before.

81
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:31,698
Bring them back! Do it!

82
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,740
Take it easy. The folks are okay.

83
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:44,725
We'll just put them up there for safekeeping.

84
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:52,708
Who are you?

85
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,705
Like mummy said

86
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,699
I'm a superior being from the fifth dimension.

87
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:00,699
What do you want with me?

88
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:01,702
Laughs.

89
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:02,806
You see, for centuries now,

90
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,707
I've been pitting my inter-dimensional magic

91
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:09,710
against schmoes who thought they could go 15 rounds

92
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,697
with the old master.

93
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:15,698
You know the stories about genies, imps

94
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:16,736
and leprechauns?

95
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:24,722
You? Guilty.

96
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,707
After a while, I became bored

97
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,694
with your basic rank-and-file human dolts.

98
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:30,709
But then you showed up.

99
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,707
Superman!

100
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:35,713
You, my friend, are the ultimate challenge.

101
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:39,706
We're gonna have many merry games, you and I.

102
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,708
A game has rules.

103
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:44,724
Your stunts are just random idiocy.

104
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,694
Okay, I'll give you a rule.

105
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,703
You make me say, spell

106
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:53,708
or otherwise reveal my name backwards

107
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:56,700
and I'll split until our dimensions

108
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:57,707
come into alignment again

109
00:07:57,731 --> 00:08:00,712
in about, oh, three months, eh, give or take.

110
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,704
I can't even say your name forward.

111
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,708
How am I supposed to say it backward?

112
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,696
No, dope!

113
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,700
You don't have to say it backward.

114
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:11,698
You have to get <i>me to say it.</i>

115
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:12,704
Say what?

116
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,701
Kltpzyxm!

117
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,708
Gosh, you're thick!

118
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,704
Now, for the last time..

119
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,717
Aw, nuts!

120
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:23,700
Clark? Dear?

121
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,693
Did something just happen?

122
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:26,734
No.

123
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:28,714
What's for dinner?

124
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,718
Hi, guy.

125
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,699
Your three months are up

126
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:09,698
and this time you're not gonna cheat me out of my fun.

127
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:11,705
Oh, it's you again, Mr. Kltpzyxm.

128
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,706
Not Kltpzyxm!

129
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,689
Mxyzptlk!

130
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:17,697
Now, the first thing I'm gonna do..

131
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,718
Oh, nuts.

132
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,694
Ha, ha!

133
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,699
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?

134
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:46,696
Look, little guy, I'm tired of this.

135
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,685
If it's a fight you want..

136
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,690
Oh, it is, it is.

137
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,695
Fine. First let me proofread this article

138
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,697
and I'll meet you on the roof in 20 minutes.

139
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,684
No stalling!

140
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,723
I'll edit the rag for you.

141
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,685
There.

142
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,723
Hey, what? No!

143
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,699
Hmm. You're getting sloppy, Smallville.

144
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,728
This sentence is loaded with typos.

145
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:27,726
"K-L-T-P-Z.."

146
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,727
Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!

147
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,699
Grrrrr!

148
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,683
He beat you again, huh?

149
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:45,701
Grrrrr!

150
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,710
Don't start with me, Gsptlsnz!

151
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,725
I've only got 90 days until my next bout

152
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,683
with that caped clod!

153
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,699
How does he do it?

154
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:02,686
Mxy, I wore this new outfit just for you.

155
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,694
No time for love, babe.

156
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:06,689
Gotta beat Superman.

157
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:07,694
Grrrrrr!

158
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:10,696
Oh, Mxy, I don't like the way you're obsessing

159
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,695
over this Superman person.

160
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,694
Using our powers to torment humans is so..

161
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,686
Three-dimensional.

162
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,682
Got to beat Superman.

163
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,695
If he upsets you that much, why don't you just..

164
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,688
Oh, I don't know, destroy him?

165
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,685
Hey, that's it.

166
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,869
Next time I'll finish him off

167
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:30,718
before he can trick me.

168
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:32,695
Mwah.

169
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,723
Thanks, Gspie.

170
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:35,679
Love ya.

171
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,710
Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.

172
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,695
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

173
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,695
Now you're gonna get it.

174
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,715
Oh, yeah!

175
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,709
You'll be crying early today, boy.

176
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:12,675
Bye, Gspie.

177
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,697
Don't wait up. Ha, ha!

178
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:20,674
Ohhh, Five, four, three..

179
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:22,718
Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!

180
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,703
Not one word.

181
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,681
Don't you look happy.

182
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:45,717
What's wrong, bad news?

183
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:47,681
You could say that.

184
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,689
I'm expecting a visitor from out of town.

185
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:52,672
Guy's kind of a pest, is he?

186
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,674
The worst.

187
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,671
I hear ya. Every time my sister visits

188
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:59,697
she just moves right on in and stays and stays and..

189
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,681
Was that a penguin?

190
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,694
I'm afraid so.

191
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:10,701
Here we go.

192
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,680
Wow, look at all the animals.

193
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,674
This is really weird.

194
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:41,713
Whoa, you're fast, kiddo.

195
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:45,687
Hiya, Super.

196
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:48,707
Looks like you've joined the horsy set.

197
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:53,668
What's it gonna take to get rid of you?

198
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:53,713
Forever?

199
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:55,689
You always trick me

200
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:57,679
into doing that name thing once.

201
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:00,686
But this time, you're going to have to make me do it

202
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,675
twice in a row.

203
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:07,669
Which means, I can say kltpzyxm all I want

204
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:11,685
as long as I break it, kltpzyxm up. Ha!

205
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:14,670
If you beat me, then I'm history.

206
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:17,668
Gone, <i>finito, bye-bye.</i>

207
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:22,674
But if I win, I got me a new stableboy.

208
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:23,679
Deal?

209
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,674
Whatever you want.

210
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:26,709
I quit.

211
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:30,679
Huh? You don't mean it.

212
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:31,711
Oh, yes, I do.

213
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,529
Shut off the lights when you're done, will you?

214
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,683
Hey! Hey! You can't just walk out.

215
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:40,677
If you do, your friends will stay mindless beasts.

216
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:42,687
They don't seem to mind.

217
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,673
Whoa!

218
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,683
Don't get tough with me, little boy blue.

219
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:48,671
If you don't cooperate

220
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:50,677
I'll tell the world your secret.

221
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,676
Blab your head off.

222
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,697
I'll find another disguise.

223
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,681
You can't outfly me.

224
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,671
Watch me.

225
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,703
Oh, yeah?

226
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,691
Banzai!

227
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:26,700
Ah!

228
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,684
Aah! No fair!

229
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:00,676
Want to play hardball? Fine!

230
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,674
Hey, Super, get a load of me.

231
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:06,662
The ultimate smart bomb

232
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:09,663
complete with a Kryptonite warhead.

233
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,687
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

234
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:31,685
Aah!

235
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:43,689
Good try, blue, but not good enough!

236
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:10,692
What's the matter, Super feeling the heat?

237
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,661
I won! I won!

238
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,673
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

239
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:29,676
In your face, Superman.

240
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,669
No, loser.

241
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,675
In yours.

242
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:36,677
Oh, shoot my monkey.

243
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,676
Ha, ha. I skywrote my own name.

244
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,681
Ha, ha! Backwards.

245
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:46,663
Twice.

246
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:48,694
You were just toying with me the whole time.

247
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,674
Even from the start.

248
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,663
Pretty much, yeah.

249
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:55,691
Never had you fooled for a second.

250
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:01,675
You were the superior being all along.

251
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:04,675
Well... And now I'm gone.

252
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,686
Gone forever.

253
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,680
Whew!

254
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:22,670
You look happy. What's up?

255
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,673
I was expecting a visitor from out of town

256
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,661
but he can't make it.

257
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,659
The guy's kind of a pest, is he?

258
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:29,693
Not anymore.

259
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:32,666
Guests are the worst.

260
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,654
Every time my sister visits

261
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:35,658
she just moves right on in

262
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,685
and stays and stays and...

263
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,687
why am I eating this?

264
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,652
Oh, you! You!

265
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,670
I'm not done with you!

266
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,671
Not by a long shot!

267
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,695
I'll find a loophole.

268
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,662
Somehow, someday!

269
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,655
You know, now that you're stuck here

270
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,664
you'll just have to find some other way

271
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,660
to pass the time.

272
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,658
Mmm.

273
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,695
Hey, this isn't so bad.

274
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,695
Mmm.

275
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:14,689
Arrgh!
