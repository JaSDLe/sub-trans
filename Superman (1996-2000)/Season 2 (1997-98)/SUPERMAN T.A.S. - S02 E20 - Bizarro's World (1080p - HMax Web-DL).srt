1
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,277
Turn your vehicle around. No one's allowed past this point.

2
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:33,419
Luthor has buried his connection to that cloning lab long enough.

3
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:36,317
Do you wanna be his stooge, or help a free press?

4
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:39,253
Lady, you had one warning. My orders are to...

5
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,257
There a problem here?

6
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:44,787
Yeah. This beefhead...

7
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:49,402
No problem at all, as long as the lady turns around.

8
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:53,671
Don't bother. I checked already. There's nothing left up there.

9
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:58,577
I guess that includes Bizarro.

10
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,804
He must have been completely vaporized.

11
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,814
Just think what it would have been like for him if he'd lived.

12
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,611
First finding out he wasn't...

13
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:08,754
well, you, and then his home...

14
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,152
his whole world destroyed in one day.

15
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:15,351
- Could you imagine? - Yeah, I think I can.

16
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:20,157
<i>He'd probably feel a lot like I did when I learned I wasn't human.</i>

17
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,012
<i>You don't know who you are...</i>

18
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:38,844
<i>where you belong...</i>

19
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:42,511
<i>why you're here.</i>

20
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,435
Well, I'm up here training for the Olympics...

21
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,514
- Who's that? - It's a monster!

22
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:12,846
- I'm out of here. - Let's get out of here. Run!

23
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,790
This no am home.

24
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:22,485
<i>After all this time, Metropolis still knows so little about...</i>

25
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,661
<i>the real Superman.</i>

26
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,492
<i>Only one person is known to have pierced the iron wall...</i>

27
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,657
<i>around the Man of Steel:</i>

28
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,394
<i>Professor Emil Hamilton of S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

29
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,302
<i>Rumor has it that he's even been to Superman's secret hideaway...</i>

30
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:38,911
<i>a mysterious fortress hidden somewhere near the North Pole.</i>

31
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:41,843
<i>I tried asking Hamilton if this was Superman's home...</i>

32
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,074
<i>but the professor declined to comment.</i>

33
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:48,152
North Pole? Home?

34
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,195
Why am you locked up?

35
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:40,538
Me bet you do nothing wrong.

36
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:03,659
Doggie, you am new friend?

37
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,823
<i>Welcome to Krypton.</i>

38
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:44,767
<i>What is it you wish to know?</i>

39
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:47,236
Who am me?

40
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:50,103
Where am home?

41
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,301
<i>One moment, please.</i>

42
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,648
<i>This is your home... the planet Krypton.</i>

43
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,948
<i>A majestic world of scientific achievement and prosperity.</i>

44
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:10,328
<i>You are Kal-El, son of Jor-El.</i>

45
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:18,102
<i>Your father was a world-renowned scientist...</i>

46
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,263
<i>and member of Krypton's ruling council.</i>

47
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,969
<i>An only child, you were born shortly before the end...</i>

48
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:30,013
<i>of Krypton's seventh age.</i>

49
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:48,163
Who let you out? Don't tell me we've had visitors.

50
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:18,687
Oh, no.

51
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,567
Me make Krypton.

52
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:46,714
Then me am home.

53
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:23,299
Too many chairs.

54
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:26,031
Me make room.

55
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:28,934
He's up there!

56
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,842
He's wrecking everything in sight.

57
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,713
Dada?

58
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:49,823
Dada. No be scared, me am Kay-Lil.

59
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:52,899
Me take you home.

60
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,233
That's just dandy. Now we got a hostage situation.

61
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,502
I want this area locked down.

62
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:05,506
Get those people out of there.

63
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:13,177
Scram, Lane. This is a police matter.

64
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:16,449
Yeah, Turpin. Like that really works with me.

65
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,092
Loiz?

66
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,999
- Bizarro? - You know this guy?

67
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,533
Figures, all the wackos come to you.

68
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,902
Me show Loiz new home?

69
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:36,511
Hold it, bub. You're not showing anyone any...

70
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,411
- Hey! - Wait.

71
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,607
I'll go. I'd love to.

72
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:45,783
I can't let you do that. It's too dangerous.

73
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,615
And duking it out with him is safe?

74
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:50,724
Superman will be here soon. I'll keep him calm in the meantime.

75
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,960
Okay, let's go.

76
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:07,235
Oh, great. Now we got two hostages.

77
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:18,244
This my house. What you think?

78
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:23,884
It's you.

79
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:34,491
Hey, you scare Krypto.

80
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,372
But me forgive you.

81
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,310
Let me guess. Bizarro?

82
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:50,647
- Any idea what he's doing? - Remodeling.

83
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,980
He thinks he's me, so he's trying to create...

84
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,487
- his own version of Krypton. - Naturally.

85
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,326
That building won't last long.

86
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,560
I'll be right back.

87
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:11,831
If Krypton is what Bizarro wants, that's what he's gonna get.

88
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:15,170
I had to take this beat. Humans weren't nuts enough.

89
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:20,773
- Loiz sit? - SUre.

90
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:39,198
- So, what is all this? - It am Dada's house on Krypton.

91
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,961
Krypton? You remember Krypton?

92
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:44,405
Shiny ball show me.

93
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:49,010
It say me am Kay-Lil, and it show me baby me.

94
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:52,940
Unfortunately, shiny ball was confused at the time.

95
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:02,651
Superman! Me am happy to see you.

96
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,726
Likewise, but why don't we continue this reunion outside.

97
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,986
Me not give up home.

98
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,793
No, of course not. In fact, I brought you a housewarming present.

99
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,230
Catch.

100
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,569
Pretty. Thanks.

101
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,676
Kryptonite didn't knock him out.

102
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,335
Our cell structures must be too different.

103
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,640
Time for plan B.

104
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:02,915
Superman play with Krypto. Here, fetch!

105
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,481
No!

106
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,657
Superman!

107
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,171
This am nice.

108
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:38,479
Superman, Krypto, Dada, Loiz, all here with me.

109
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,485
Krypton pretty.

110
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,648
So sad now it have to blow up.

111
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,422
Wait.

112
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:09,080
- Superman! - Superman!

113
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:10,683
Help!

114
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,185
Superman! Can you hear us?

115
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,843
- Which way? - Like a bullet.

116
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,775
The Fort Sherman Missile Base.

117
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,508
Get people underground. He wants to blow up the city.

118
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,218
Call me crazy for asking, but why would he wanna do that?

119
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,391
To play out the end of Krypton.

120
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,292
Naturally.

121
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:47,837
All right, men, just hold your positions. Hold your positions.

122
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,239
Hold your fire, hold your fire!

123
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,285
You no stop missile. Krypton need missile.

124
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:40,618
Bizarro, you've gotta listen.

125
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,307
You'll kill millions of people.

126
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,076
That how Krypton end.

127
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,144
But this isn't Krypton.

128
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,373
Me make it Krypton. Now Krypton explode.

129
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,959
And what about Lois? If you do this, Lois will die.

130
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,628
Loiz?

131
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,136
Loiz not on Krypton.

132
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,962
Right, but she's down there now.

133
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:33,975
Me save Loiz.

134
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,638
Lois.

135
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,923
- Loiz no want to be saved? - Sure she does.

136
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,393
It's all right. Lois is safe.

137
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,959
I'm fine. See?

138
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,997
Now, how would you like to know what happened after Krypton exploded?

139
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,200
After?

140
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,718
This can be your new planet. A place to protect.

141
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,950
Me hate planet. It am empty.

142
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:58,221
How can me be protector when no one here to protect?

143
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,897
Actually, I thought of that.

144
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,700
Krypto!

145
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,153
Me am happy now.

146
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,918
