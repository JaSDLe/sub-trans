1
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:38,607
Behind the line, Lytener.

2
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,595
Beautiful day, isn't it?

3
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,596
The sunshine is so... energizing.

4
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,587
That's close enough.

5
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:46,606
Close enough to what?

6
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,628
I'm not even here.

7
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,622
Lytener?

8
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:07,605
- What happened? - Get a doctor.

9
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,611
- Is he breathing? - I don't know.

10
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:26,591
So long, warden.

11
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,613
Thanks for everything.

12
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,621
What the..

13
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,587
No, that was it, thanks for clearing up the quote

14
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,613
your honor.

15
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:14,615
Ow!

16
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,591
- You okay, Clark? - Yeah.

17
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,579
Just a little... weak, I guess.

18
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,616
Bet it's the weather. Knocks me right out.

19
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,584
- Clark Kent. - Kent.

20
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,592
Do me a favor and cover for me

21
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,580
at the animal rights coalition.

22
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:31,584
Where are you?

23
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:32,591
Heading over to Truman Island.

24
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:35,577
Got a tip on Lytener's next move.

25
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:38,578
What happened to laying low until this guy was caught?

26
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,579
It was driving me nuts is what happened.

27
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:41,591
And if he takes a shot at you?

28
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:45,593
Then you'll know who did it.. Aah!

29
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:46,617
Lois?

30
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,596
Lytener.

31
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:07,618
Don't feel bad, Lois.

32
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,606
It's not personal this time.

33
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:14,584
I have bigger fish to fry now

34
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,598
and frankly, you're just bait.

35
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,589
Unh.

36
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,588
Oh, yeah. That makes me feel better.

37
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:25,597
Ah. Speak of the devil, and here he comes.

38
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,591
Someday I'll have to figure out

39
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:35,593
how he's always watching over you.

40
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,586
Lois, I can't hang on for long! The tram's too heavy!

41
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,600
Just wait, Superman. This is only the beginning.

42
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:02,583
- Lytener. - It's Luminus now.

43
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:06,581
Tell me, Superman, feeling a little under the weather?

44
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,588
Quick! Give me your hand!

45
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,577
Yes, tend to Lois.

46
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:12,587
This was just a test.

47
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,596
You'll realize what I've done to you in time.

48
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:18,585
See you soon.

49
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,588
Even if you don't see me.

50
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:48,587
- Are you alright? - I don't know.

51
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,563
Unh.

52
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,598
What's happening?

53
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,603
It's... red.

54
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,571
Naturally the sun itself is still yellow

55
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,569
but we're seeing it through a force field

56
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:53,578
emitted by a series of satellites.

57
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:56,560
This force field is filtering our sunlight

58
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,558
so that only the red wavelengths get through.

59
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:00,574
Come on, Lex.

60
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:02,562
Those are your satellites up there

61
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:03,578
and Lytener's worked for you before.

62
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:06,594
How do you expect me to believe you have nothing to do with it?

63
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,564
What you believe makes little difference to me.

64
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,564
The fact is I did provide Lytener resources

65
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:18,567
while behind bars, but only for legitimate Lexcorp research.

66
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,555
I had no idea he'd escape,

67
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,562
and I certainly didn't tell him

68
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:24,565
to hijack my satellites for his own revenge.

69
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,571
Heck, why not? You'd love to see superman dead.

70
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:29,563
Oh, please, Lois.

71
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:32,575
Forget that I'm losing millions in communications revenues.

72
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,574
Do you really think I'd jeopardize

73
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:36,574
the welfare of the planet just to settle

74
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,586
my personal grudge with Superman?

75
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,561
Check the trades, SEC reports.

76
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,554
See if Luthor's recently unloaded

77
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,569
any satellite control equipment.

78
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,561
If Lex is behind Lytener

79
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:57,568
he'll have covered his tracks

80
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:00,574
put the hardware under another name.

81
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,551
And, uh, while you guys are on that

82
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,580
I'm gonna check if there's anything down in microfilm.

83
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,554
Getting weaker, I see.

84
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,569
You must be at, what, half strength by now.

85
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:38,589
Wanna try me?

86
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,577
A hologram.

87
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,553
Maybe this is the real me.

88
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:49,559
But then again..

89
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,591
Maybe it's me.

90
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:52,584
Or me.

91
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,566
Enough, Lytener. What do you want?

92
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,545
To kill you for getting in my way.

93
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,554
For making a mockery of me and my work.

94
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,572
And how are holograms supposed to kill me?

95
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,559
Well, we might only be made of light..

96
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,578
But so are lasers.

97
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:33,550
One of you is real.

98
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,588
Ah-ah-ah.

99
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:02,555
Gotcha.

100
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,568
Unh.

101
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,555
Testing time's over, Superman.

102
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,566
Next time we meet, you die.

103
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,561
Ow!

104
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,548
I just can't figure out what happened to Clark.

105
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,540
I still think we should've waited for him.

106
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,565
He snoozes, he loses.

107
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:09,549
This is the address. Lexcorp Satellite-com.

108
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:12,551
- Currently out of use. - And out of sight.

109
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:15,556
There's supposed to be a building here.

110
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,577
Look! Up in the sky!

111
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,547
It's a bird.

112
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,562
Yeah, but what's it sitting on?

113
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:29,576
Come on.

114
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,552
Ha!

115
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,554
Unh! Ow.

116
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,573
I think I found a doorknob.

117
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:53,545
It's unlocked?

118
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:56,574
If you had an invisible door, would you bother to lock it?

119
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,562
Maybe I can find a light.

120
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:27,548
That better?

121
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,533
I can have the rocket operational within the hour.

122
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:35,544
Good, if I can shoot a few of those satellites

123
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:38,540
out of the sky, maybe I can let in some real sunlight.

124
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:42,561
Sorry, Superman. No space jaunts for you today.

125
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,555
- Where are they? - Want to save them?

126
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,536
All you have to do..

127
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Is follow the bouncing ball.

128
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,539
Superman, you're almost powerless.

129
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:07,525
He's obviously trying to lure you in.

130
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:09,554
And doing a good job.

131
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,547
Unh!

132
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,543
Howdy!

133
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:34,542
I wouldn't bother.

134
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,584
Here's the game, Superman.

135
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:43,525
Lois and her friend are somewhere in the building.

136
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,525
Find them, and I spare their lives.

137
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,518
I don't play games, Lytener.

138
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,532
Oh, come now.

139
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,521
After all I went through to remove your powers

140
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,552
I do deserve to have a little fun.

141
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,557
Trying to scare me with holograms again?

142
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:08,906
With the proper use of laser fields

143
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,528
the hologram actually feels quite solid

144
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:13,546
doesn't it?

145
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,518
Now what?

146
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,535
Avast there!

147
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,513
Prepare to taste cold steel!

148
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:18,547
Ha!

149
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,542
Into the briny with you!

150
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,496
Just as well that you found your way through.

151
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,529
I'll enjoy finishing this myself.

152
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,504
How does it feel to be mortal, Superman?

153
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:13,498
To know pain? Well, don't worry.

154
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,528
You won't have to endure it for long.

155
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,521
No!

156
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:08,489
No!

157
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,517
I can still finish you off!

158
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:35,521
Uh.. Ooh!

159
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,513
- Superman, how do you feel? - Disable the satellites?

160
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:05,499
Aah! Get those lights out of my eyes.

161
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:06,502
You heard him.

162
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:09,510
Put him somewhere nice and dark.
