1
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,799
So how's it work?

2
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:14,568
- I wish I could tell you. - Top secret, huh?

3
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,039
No, it's Kryptonian technology, based on the Phantom Zone projector.

4
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,147
We don't fully understand it yet.

5
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,580
Can you really look into other dimensions with it?

6
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,482
In theory, it should be a kind of window.

7
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,088
But all we've been able to get so far is static.

8
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,128
You see?

9
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,181
Hey!

10
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,186
- Professor, it's different. - What is?

11
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:07,186
The glass is cracked. You can see it between the posts.

12
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:11,093
It works. We're looking into another dimension.

13
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,629
Lois!

14
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,487
Looks like you still got a few bugs to work out, profess...

15
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,556
Professor? Jimmy?

16
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:40,820
Anybody?

17
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,164
Oh, my God.

18
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,868
Well, at least some things are the same around here.

19
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,347
Where is everybody?

20
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,009
Hey, could you help...?

21
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,250
Nice guy.

22
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,095
This is new.

23
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,397
Luthor?

24
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,196
"The men who saved Metropolis"?

25
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,371
<i>It's 10:00. Curfew time.</i>

26
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,003
<i>Superman wishes you all a pleasant evening and a restful sleep.</i>

27
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,842
<i>Good night.</i>

28
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,615
Let's have a look at that curfew card, ma'am.

29
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,619
Turpin.

30
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,815
That's what it says on my badge.

31
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,459
Now, where's that card?

32
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,592
Oh, yeah, it's right here in my pur...

33
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,562
Oh, whoops, no purse. I'll just run home and...

34
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,628
I don't think so.

35
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,632
Look, there's been a mistake.

36
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,671
And you're the one who made it, lady. Now come on.

37
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:13,245
This is Turpin. I'm at Lexcorp Research, Ninth and Ross.

38
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,118
Some of them rebels just blew in a door. Send backup.

39
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:26,127
All right, dirt bags. Time for a taste of law and order.

40
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,922
- Jimmy? - Lois? But you're... Look out!

41
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,029
- It's him! - Blast him.

42
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,496
Get him!

43
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,815
Stay back.

44
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:23,715
Drop the gun.

45
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,984
We're not taking any more orders from you.

46
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,291
You get one warning.

47
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,237
Come on.

48
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,177
Come on!

49
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,795
Stay in the shadows. They got surveillance cameras everywhere.

50
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,371
We're just lucky Superman didn't follow us.

51
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,168
He... He's so different.

52
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,743
Different? What about you?

53
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,245
- What do you mean? - You're supposed to be dead.

54
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,122
You were working on that Intergang piece.

55
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,788
They put a bomb in your car. Remember?

56
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,797
Sure, but Superman saved me.

57
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,998
He didn't save you.

58
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,435
He got there a split second too late.

59
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,665
I saw the photos.

60
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,841
That's when everything changed. He started wearing the black costume.

61
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,421
Then he teamed up with Luthor. Said he wanted to make the city safe again.

62
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,419
Here's the result.

63
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,697
Who are they?

64
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,173
People who've lost their jobs, their families,

65
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,303
because they wouldn't go with the program.

66
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,198
We're part of the resistance now.

67
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,205
It's your turn to explain. How'd you survive?

68
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,709
- Jimmy, it's a long story, and... - Jim!

69
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,844
We were listening on the police scanner.

70
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,676
We thought Superman got you.

71
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,819
- I was the lucky one. - Did you get it?

72
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,879
Superman's not gonna be a problem much longer.

73
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,056
All we need is the right opportunity.

74
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,339
Everyone, against the walls.

75
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,684
Adults to Detainment Center C. Children to the Lexcorp orphanage.

76
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,654
- My baby! - Mommy!

77
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,026
Let go of me. Let go.

78
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,698
It can't be.

79
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,536
I'll interrogate this one myself.

80
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,715
Get up. He wants you.

81
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,046
Naturally, I was quite skeptical...

82
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,056
when Commander Graves said you were still alive.

83
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,718
But according to this DNA scan, you are Lois Lane.

84
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,590
No question who you are.

85
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,462
You're the one thing that's exactly the same.

86
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,906
The insolence, the outright rudeness.

87
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,135
She's definitely the genuine article.

88
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,609
- But how? - It doesn't matter.

89
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,908
If he finds out she's still alive, who knows what he'll do.

90
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,143
He's hard enough to work with as it is.

91
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,287
So you want me to...?

92
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,447
Yes, but not here.

93
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,426
Hey, I'm not finished!

94
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,758
I beg to differ.

95
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,760
Get your hands off me!

96
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,202
Hey!

97
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,274
Find some other street to walk on, you two-bit tart.

98
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,841
Angela?

99
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,284
Lois? Lois Lane?

100
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:51,550
My God, it's you. It's really you. You're alive, after all these years.

101
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,659
Can you loan me a dollar?

102
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,295
Out of the way!

103
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,231
Don't do anything stupid, Lois.

104
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,406
This is Graves at Lexcorp. I need...

105
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,601
She's inside the monument.

106
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,587
She's on the roof now!

107
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,261
I'll shoot, I swear!

108
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,632
Lois?

109
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,569
You.

110
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:52,311
So I am Lois Lane, but I'm not the Lois you knew.

111
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,706
Ever since you... She died...

112
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:58,647
I've wondered if there were other dimensions out there.

113
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:01,988
Other versions of me and you.

114
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:05,120
Hold it. I may be a lot like your Lois...

115
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,487
but you're nothing like the Superman I know.

116
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,151
He's no tyrant.

117
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,991
I had to take control. There was no other way.

118
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:16,068
For too long I fooled myself into thinking I was doing a simple cleanup job...

119
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:20,172
that if I did enough good, people would follow my example.

120
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,433
I didn't realize it was a war.

121
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:27,342
And suddenly, you were a casualty of that war...

122
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:30,515
and I knew I had to stop it by whatever means possible.

123
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,020
You did this because of me?

124
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,183
You never knew how I felt about you.

125
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,915
I never knew...

126
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:40,858
till you were gone.

127
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,824
You could've said something.

128
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:47,660
We could've talked about it, figured it out.

129
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,359
Now look at you.

130
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,362
Married to Luthor.

131
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:55,231
I needed someone with the organization, the technology.

132
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,036
But Luthor?!

133
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,607
He just takes care of the day-to-day duties.

134
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,375
He knows that if he ever tried anything, I'd crush him.

135
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:07,112
I hate to disillusion you, but he just tried something.

136
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,720
He tried to kill me.

137
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,063
A holding cell.

138
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,463
There are others. The jail cells are below.

139
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:29,971
I swear, all I ever wanted for them was peace, order, tranquility.

140
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,145
Hey, look. It's the alien.

141
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:35,812
Why don't you come down here, creep?

142
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:39,142
- Fascist! - You should've died on Krypton!

143
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:42,015
- Where's my baby? - Get off the planet!

144
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,016
At ease.

145
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,306
Something troubling you?

146
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:43,312
I'm having trouble with your job performance.

147
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:46,145
All I've ever done is give you what you wanted.

148
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,312
Not anymore, Luthor. Show's over.

149
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,957
Maybe for you.

150
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,961
A gift from your adoring public.

151
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,799
No!

152
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:28,391
- They'll never accept you. - Oh, no?

153
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,826
I'll tell them how you forced me to enslave them.

154
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:33,899
How I stood between them and your terrible wrath.

155
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,865
Then, when I toss them your poisoned, green carcass...

156
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:40,336
I'll be more than their leader, I'll be their savior.

157
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:47,837
Olsen!

158
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,715
I'm glad you're all here.

159
00:16:49,882 --> 00:16:52,852
You can bear witness that I've been on your side all along.

160
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,544
Save it, Luthor.

161
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,416
How do you think they got here?

162
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:59,252
I had Superman stop by on the way over.

163
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,591
They had a nice, long talk.

164
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,678
Mom!

165
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:23,234
S.TA.R. Labs used to be a place for ideas and hope.

166
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:24,665
It can be again.

167
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:26,806
But will the people ever trust me again?

168
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,201
It'll take time.

169
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:31,970
I've got the time. For them and for you.

170
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,737
<i>Lois!</i>

171
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:37,713
Hamilton sent me to bring you back.

172
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:40,148
Hurry, there's not much time.

173
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:43,383
I never thought I'd lose you twice.

174
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,024
Will it change anything?

175
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:49,060
For me, but not for Metropolis. Not this time.

176
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:50,890
Lois!

177
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:22,551
- So that was me? - Yes. And no.

178
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:27,325
It... It's complicated. I could explain it over dinner.

179
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,163
Dinner? Aren't we getting a little personal?

180
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:32,202
Better now than never.

181
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,471
