1
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,426
Hang on there, Clyde-

2
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,425
Sorry, miss, we're closed-

3
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,001
Just look at what I'm selling- You'll plotz-

4
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,975
Good work, Harley girl-

5
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:54,651
Now, what would be a suitable trade for our joke-in-the-box?

6
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,336
For some reason, this just speaks to me- What do you think, Harl?

7
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,907
It's you, pudding-

8
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,884
Awfully nice doing business with you-Ta-

9
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,883
What a pleasant fellow-

10
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:41,764
It's weird-All this junk and the Joker only takes one lousy statue-

11
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:45,939
Especially since word on the street says he's desperate for cash these days-

12
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:49,306
Things are never what they seem with the Joker-

13
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:53,372
I guess the night brings out all the wackos-

14
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,119
It was made of jade, worth maybe a hundred grand-

15
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,230
I'd like a closer look-

16
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,199
Hey-He can't leave a crime scene with evidence-

17
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:18,364
You want to stop him, be my guest-

18
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:44,159
According to this, the <i>Laughing Dragon</i> has earned quite a foreboding reputation-

19
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,430
Ever since it was carved in China nearly 30 years ago...

20
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:52,507
it has passed through several owners, all of whom died prematurely-

21
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,576
And I can tell you why-

22
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,109
This so-called jade is emitting low-level radiation-

23
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:04,080
Alfred, isn't Bruce Wayne about due for a trip to Metropolis?

24
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:07,314
Yes, but do you think this is an appropriate time?

25
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:11,790
I'd say the timing couldn't be better-

26
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,639
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

27
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:34,409
if you stay calm, you may actually live to write about this-

28
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,017
Is the president secured?

29
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,787
Copy-We've already informed him...

30
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:41,549
<i>of our change in flight plans.</i>

31
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,457
- What's going on? - What's he doing to her?

32
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,498
Let's make an example of this hero-

33
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,044
A very tragic example, I'm afraid, Miss...?

34
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,375
- Lane- - Lane? Lois Lane?

35
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:08,012
The one Superman always saves?

36
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,153
Afraid so-

37
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,727
Thanks for strapping me in-

38
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,653
Happy I could help out, Mr-President-

39
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:58,634
I hope I didn't shake you and the others up too badly-

40
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:01,933
I hate to say, I've gotten used to it-

41
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,940
Superman?

42
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,903
Yes?

43
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:14,414
How can I put this?

44
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,678
I was just thinking, it might be nice to see each other...

45
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:21,915
when I wasn't, I don't know, falling out a window or something-

46
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,220
I'm grateful for all the times you've helped me, you understand...

47
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,121
- I understand- - You do?

48
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:40,005
- It's the First National Bank- - You'd better go-People might...

49
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,337
Get hurt-

50
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,080
"I understand, Lois-" "Really, you do?"

51
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:53,416
"Yep-You're a complete moron-" "Why, thank you, Superman-

52
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,252
I think I'm a total loser too-" Jeez-

53
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,458
"A grateful president bestows heartfelt thanks...

54
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,895
on Metropolis' favorite son, Superman-".

55
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,297
Favorite son, my...

56
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,502
Mercy- Start the car-I'm coming down-

57
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:15,536
Right away, Lex-

58
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:41,869
The office-Now-Swell, Mr-I-

59
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:46,008
"Mr-I-"? Mercy?

60
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,068
Oh, yeah, she had a little accident-

61
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,190
All right, missy-I don't know what your game is...

62
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,591
but I promise you you'll pay dearly for this!

63
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,691
You're dead-Do you hear me?

64
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,995
Blah, blah, blah-

65
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:16,669
Whoa, mama! Check out the cute hitchhiker-

66
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,841
Yoo-hoo!

67
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:30,581
- Joker- - Lexy, old kid-

68
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:34,281
Do I have a deal for you-

69
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:54,091
Rich Corinthian leather- What do you want?

70
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,455
I sense we are kindred spirits, you and I-

71
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:02,930
Oh, there are differences to be sure- Like hair-

72
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,162
But underneath it all, we're both entrepreneurs, men of vision-

73
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,433
We see an opportunity, we grab it- Am I right?

74
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:15,007
Right-

75
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,972
But in the past few weeks, I've had a run of bad luck...

76
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,948
bad luck that wears a cape-

77
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,912
Thanks to that miserable, pointy-eared rodent, Batman...

78
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,856
all my operations in Gotham City have been shut down-

79
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:34,061
But you too have an overgrown bully in long underwear...

80
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:37,031
which brings me to my little proposition-

81
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,533
I'm listening-

82
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,572
Pay me one billion dollars, and I'll kill Superman-

83
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,171
What makes you think you can kill Superman...

84
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:51,441
when you can't even handle a mere mortal in a Halloween costume?

85
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:56,711
There's nothing mere about that mortal-Besides...

86
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,050
I've read up on your fly boy-

87
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,125
I know his weakness-

88
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,060
See? Solid Kryptonite-

89
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,895
You know I can't be connected to this in any way-

90
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,331
Oh, you'll be Mr-Clean, I promise-Deal?

91
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,602
Deal-

92
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,152
I hear Wayne's deal with LexCorp could run into the billions-He's a high roller-

93
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:32,148
I hear he's nothing but Gotham trash-

94
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:34,315
Rich, spoiled...

95
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,821
and absolutely gorgeous-

96
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,263
- Mr-Wayne-Mr-Wayne- - What brings you to Metropolis?

97
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,735
How long will you stay?

98
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,275
Quick, is my hair straight?

99
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:59,146
Excuse me, aren't you the famous Lois Lane?

100
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:08,855
Me? Famous? Well, hardly- I mean, uh... This is Clark Kent-

101
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,957
Mr-Wayne-

102
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:14,221
I read all about your adventure on Air Force One-

103
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:18,227
- You're quite the newsmaker- - No more than you-

104
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,366
Which brings up the question of why you're in town-

105
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,974
Mr-Wayne, your car-

106
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:28,140
Maybe we can discuss it over dinner, if you're available-

107
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:32,741
Totally-I mean, I think so- I'll have to check my calen... Yes-

108
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:36,049
Great-I'll pick you up at 8-

109
00:11:57,141 --> 00:12:01,010
Who'd have figured a guy named Weasel could cook this good?

110
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,670
Caesar Carlini, my old pal-

111
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,818
Why, I haven't seen you since... Wait-

112
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:09,647
I've never seen you, have I? You need to get out more-

113
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,847
- Who is this clown? - Not "Clown-".

114
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,788
Joker-

115
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:20,996
I'm in town on business and I need a place to hang my hat-

116
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,765
Try the Motel Nine-

117
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:27,268
But it would be so much cozier at your place, like a sleepover-

118
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,430
Are you nuts?

119
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,098
Kill him-

120
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,678
Can I play too?

121
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:53,057
Carlini, all that spicy food- You look a little gassy-

122
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:57,098
No-Stop-

123
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,183
Holy guacamole-Looks like you need a new leader-

124
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,910
I nominate me-

125
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,680
I second the nomination-

126
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:22,319
All opposed?

127
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,253
They found him like this at the city dump-

128
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,866
The lights are on but nobody's home-

129
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,433
But we know who did it-

130
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,536
He's telling us right now-

131
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:13,394
As you can see, the WayneLex T7 can traverse the most difficult terrain...

132
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,968
never losing sight of its ultimate target-

133
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,721
Fourteen-point-eight seconds-

134
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,614
Congratulations-

135
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,089
This is your project too, you know-

136
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,985
Well, I'm proud of the work both our teams have done-

137
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:46,327
These robots are gonna revolutionize unmanned space travel-

138
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:51,263
Actually, there may be a use for them closer to home-

139
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,210
The Joint Chiefs have shown tremendous interest-

140
00:14:57,378 --> 00:15:01,179
It doesn't take much imagination to envision these robots on the battlefield-

141
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,115
Except I won't allow it-

142
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:08,685
- What? - I don't like guns-

143
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:11,951
Well, Bruce, I think I have something to say about this-

144
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,419
Not according to our deal-

145
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:17,690
All technological applications need my approval first-

146
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,697
Blame it on me, Lex-

147
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,032
Tell your pals at the Pentagon...

148
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:24,637
I just don't have the imagination-

149
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:30,941
So he just appears when there's trouble? No special signal?

150
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,876
He's not like your Batman, thank goodness-

151
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:35,646
Then how do you contact him?

152
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,977
Committing a felony helps-

153
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,048
Listen, you seem awfully interested in Superman-

154
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:45,215
- Do you want me to fix you two up? - Sorry-

155
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:47,418
No, I'm sorry- It's just that I was hoping...

156
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:50,655
to get away from the subject of the Man of Steel for one night-

157
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,327
I've been a little too consumed with him lately-

158
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:02,405
Maybe we could change subjects-

159
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:05,310
No more men in tights?

160
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,947
Deal-

161
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,694
So just keep your ears open-

162
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,635
Let me know if you hear any buzz about the Joker-

163
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,840
Sure thing, Mr-Kent-

164
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:40,610
But, uh, which one?

165
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,410
There's lots of jokers around here-

166
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:15,143
Hey, sweetheart- What are you, deaf? Another round!

167
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,046
- What's going on? - What's happening?

168
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,484
Who is he?

169
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,763
It's been a long time, Binko-

170
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,325
I heard your boss Carlini's been replaced-

171
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:37,095
We need to talk-

172
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:47,879
Let's get out of here-

173
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,553
Get him!

174
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:01,056
Hey!

175
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,404
Where's the Joker?

176
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,913
Who knows? Making ha-ha with Harley Quinn-

177
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:27,015
I don't know-Honest- I never went back after he muscled in-

178
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:29,520
I don't want nothing to do with that clown-

179
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:32,927
That's enough- I think you got your answer-

180
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:54,747
I heard you were crazy- I didn't think you were stupid-

181
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:01,751
- Bruce Wayne? - You peeked-

182
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:04,422
I won't have vigilantism in my town-

183
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:08,523
You'll be rid of me- As soon as I find the Joker-

184
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:11,591
That may not be soon enough-

185
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:17,432
It doesn't take much, does it?

186
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,200
The Joker has 20 pounds more where this came from-

187
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,941
Thought you might like to know-

188
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,272
- Hello- - Hi-

189
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:58,002
I just wanted to let you know, I'll be in late tomorrow-

190
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:00,007
I'm having breakfast with Bruce-

191
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:02,944
Isn't that special?

192
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,842
Do I detect a note of disapproval?

193
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,147
You were the one who compared him to garbage-

194
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:10,257
<i>Well, I was wrong.</i>

195
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,450
He's very thoughtful and much deeper...

196
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:16,187
than the gossipmongers would lead you to believe-

197
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,625
- You'd be surprised- - Would I now?

198
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:25,098
<i>I'll let you go so you can count sheep...</i>

199
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:29,403
<i>or whatever you Kansas boys dream about. Bye.</i>

200
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:52,866
Touché-

201
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,828
