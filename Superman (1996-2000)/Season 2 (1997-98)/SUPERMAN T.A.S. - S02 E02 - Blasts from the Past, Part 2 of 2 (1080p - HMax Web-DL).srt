1
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:06,051
The Phantom Zone.

2
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,790
We're looking through to another dimension.

3
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,354
<i>Previously on</i> Superman...

4
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,163
You wanna return what you stole.

5
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:23,467
Yeah, yeah. Just put me down, please.

6
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,338
- Beg me. - I think I may have made a mistake.

7
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,447
The images I saw didn't say anything about her being so power-hungry.

8
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:34,985
Have the projector ready. If Mala doesn't straighten out, we have to send her back.

9
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:40,853
I will not go back. I'll destroy every being on this planet first!

10
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,816
Professor.

11
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:45,690
Mala. I tried to stop her.

12
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,593
She took the projector.

13
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,428
Welcome to Earth, my darling.

14
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:56,203
Believe me, you're going to love it here.

15
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:08,017
Almost there, professor.

16
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,814
Now, hang on. Here comes the fun part.

17
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:27,662
My word.

18
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:30,137
It's incredible.

19
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:36,237
These are the animals I saved off the Preserver's ship.

20
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:38,679
I come up every now and then to feed them...

21
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,148
and steal a few moments to be by myself.

22
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:43,549
- You know. - If anyone deserves their own...

23
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,690
fortress of solitude, it's you.

24
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:48,587
Fortress of solitude?

25
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:54,522
Astounding.

26
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,567
I could spend a career studying any one of them.

27
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:00,837
I'm sure you could, but right now we should hurry.

28
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:03,133
Yes, of course.

29
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:08,640
So this is the orb.

30
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,304
- How does it work? - Here.

31
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,849
Stand close. It's activated by my DNA.

32
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,087
<i>Welcome to Krypton.</i>

33
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:30,359
Brainiac, I'd like you to show us how to build a Phantom Zone projector.

34
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,765
<i>One moment, please.</i>

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,106
Better get out your pad and pencil.

36
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:41,507
<i>Interdimensional teleportation operates on the principle...</i>

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:47,141
<i>that each dimension in the cosmos vibrates at its own unique frequency.</i>

38
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:52,046
Fossil fuel engines.

39
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,953
Primitive, aren't they?

40
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,424
But so was Krypton centuries ago.

41
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:03,091
I see great possibilities for these beings, under my guiding hand.

42
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,633
We'll begin our conquest as soon as my power's up to yours.

43
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,468
And we've gotten rid of that one little obstacle.

44
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,906
The son of Jor-El.

45
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,808
Almighty Rao has brought me full circle, Mala...

46
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,475
giving me a planet to rule and a chance for revenge.

47
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,321
Out of the way, snails.

48
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:46,140
You...

49
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,610
- you're Mala. - It's that woman who fought Superman.

50
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,148
- And there's another one. - Quick. Let's get out of here.

51
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,317
Oh, my God!

52
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,985
My, they are afraid of us.

53
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:02,649
Would you like a demonstration why, my darling?

54
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,989
Nothing would please me more.

55
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,641
Hey, hey! Get your... Hey, put me down!

56
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,337
Help, somebody, help, help!

57
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:26,541
Somebody, please let me out! Please, help!

58
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,811
Outstanding.

59
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,525
Coming through.

60
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,992
Something going on I should know about?

61
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,256
Where have you been, on another planet?

62
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:45,392
Mala's let a friend out of the Phantom Zone, and they're tearing up the streets.

63
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,633
Hold the door!

64
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,406
Somebody, please, help me!

65
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,207
Help!

66
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:12,927
- Look, it's Superman. - Hey.

67
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:06,916
So this is Kal-El, son of Jor-El.

68
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:09,077
Your father was a clever man...

69
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:13,088
though I see you share his poor judgment in choosing sides.

70
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,385
Glad to disappoint you.

71
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:18,796
You'll face the general when spoken to.

72
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:22,798
I must say, it seems a shame to kill the one other survivor of Krypton.

73
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,493
I'd offer you a place in our new order, but...

74
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,936
- something tells me you'd turn it down. - Guess you're not as dumb as you look.

75
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:33,976
As I expected. Mala, crush his skull.

76
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,079
Thank you, general.

77
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,042
Come on, general.

78
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:20,772
Let's see if anyone salutes.

79
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,384
Let me down. Let me down.

80
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,570
- Look at Superman. - Get her.

81
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,040
All right, move it back, folks.

82
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,380
That's it, Superman. Harder!

83
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,918
Mala!

84
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:18,156
Thattaboy.

85
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,109
Thanks, but I think you just lost your dance partner.

86
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,400
- How's it coming, professor? - You're just in time.

87
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,128
We're ready to proceed.

88
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:16,154
So close.

89
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:18,451
- What's wrong? - We're missing a crystal...

90
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:22,927
that vibrates at the Phantom Zone's frequency, the homing signal to the zone.

91
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:26,590
Without it, we can't send anything in or get anything out.

92
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:29,761
But the crystal simply doesn't exist on Earth.

93
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:34,534
Keep trying. Jax-Ur's getting stronger, and they've got the projector.

94
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,509
Somehow, we've got to even the odds.

95
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:43,617
I'm paying a roomful of crack reporters...

96
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:47,017
and not one has a clue where Jax-Ur and Mala could be?

97
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,623
Those guys don't exactly blend in, people.

98
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,092
Hey, it's not like you can just look them up in the white pages.

99
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,942
Although, I think I'd call this a lead.

100
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:19,916
She's the one he cares about.

101
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:24,622
Let her go!

102
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:33,767
Tell Superman we're at Mala's cabin.

103
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:43,738
It must hurt your fingers, clamping down on my throat like that.

104
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,675
I'll live.

105
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:53,914
Here's your brave warrior, and dressed for battle, I see.

106
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:57,252
The suit's to protect me from this.

107
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:03,826
You all right, Lois?

108
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,160
Jax-Ur snuck off when they saw you coming.

109
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,627
I don't think he feels up to your strength.

110
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:08,997
Here.

111
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,662
- Keep her covered. - Love to.

112
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:17,110
I know you're here.

113
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,940
Show yourself, madman.

114
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:32,422
No!

115
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,337
That was almost too easy.

116
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:57,884
- Feeling better? - There are so many ways to kill her...

117
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,281
I can hardly choose.

118
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,682
No.

119
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,552
Let her live. She's a reporter.

120
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:06,785
Let her tell her world that Superman is gone...

121
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:08,293
forever.

122
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:23,274
I'm gonna personally lead the army that vaporizes you two.

123
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:24,912
Or vice versa.

124
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,776
Either way, see you soon.

125
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:43,762
<i>The two Kryptonian renegades attacked the United Nations this morning...</i>

126
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:46,407
<i>forcing their way into the security council.</i>

127
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:49,100
<i>When the world's leaders refused to surrender...</i>

128
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:52,338
<i>Jax-Ur promised immediate retaliation.</i>

129
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:56,716
<i>Reports of devastation are coming in from all over the world.</i>

130
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,047
<i>Here on the border of the Sahara desert...</i>

131
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,453
<i>Jax-Ur and Mala created a sandstorm that toppled buildings and buried others.</i>

132
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,392
<i>Elsewhere, in Kenya, a stampede incited by the pair crushed...</i>

133
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:10,622
And the fate of the world hangs on questions I can answer?

134
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,961
Yes, Ms. Lane. Tell me about Superman.

135
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:16,298
Was he wearing the anti-kryptonite suit when they sent him?

136
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,599
- Yeah, but... - Was the suit damaged at all?

137
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:21,513
It looked wrinkled. What does it matter?

138
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:24,474
We treated the suit with traceable coating.

139
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,946
We couldn't lock on to the homing signal to the Phantom Zone.

140
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:31,177
But we could retrieve our own signal once it was sent in.

141
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:33,014
You can get him out of there?

142
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,350
If I can find his signal...

143
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,515
Wait! There he is!

144
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:40,127
Superman, can you hear me?

145
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,523
<i>- Professor?</i> - Hang on.

146
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:44,893
We're going to try to pull you back.

147
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:52,802
The signal's weak. I don't know if I can hold onto it.

148
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:58,309
He's in pain. Do something.

149
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,778
He's being torn between dimensions.

150
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:11,850
- Superman. - Don't come too close, Lois.

151
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:13,517
The radiation.

152
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,058
What did they do with the other projector?

153
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:23,560
I still don't get it. What good is this scrap pile going to do us?

154
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:25,297
It's in a million pieces.

155
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,876
That's all right. We only need one.

156
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:39,313
In light of the destruction that has been wrought upon our world...

157
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:44,050
it is clear that we have no choice but to surrender the planet...

158
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,922
to the High General Jax-Ur.

159
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,660
You should be proud.

160
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,736
One stroke of this pen, and billions of lives will be saved.

161
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,998
I wouldn't sign that just yet.

162
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,902
What?

163
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:04,509
- Yes, it is. - I think I can negotiate a better deal.

164
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,511
- Superman. - He's back.

165
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,206
Oh, thank heavens.

166
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:12,785
Impossible.

167
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,165
Look at it this way, Kal-El.

168
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:43,675
Death is better than the Phantom Zone.

169
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,575
I'll take your word for it.

170
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,882
- Bye-bye. - No!

171
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:17,301
Parole revoked.

172
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,255
Fortress of solitude.

173
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:38,557
I mean, it's not exactly lonely up here...

174
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:41,457
though I am the only Kryptonian.

175
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:46,165
Lately, I'm thinking it's better we keep it that way.

176
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,061
