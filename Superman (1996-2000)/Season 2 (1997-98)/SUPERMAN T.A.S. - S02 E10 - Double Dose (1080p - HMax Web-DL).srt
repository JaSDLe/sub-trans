1
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,563
- Huh? - Hey, you blind?

2
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:38,566
No electronic equipment.

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,602
Your watch, you forgot to take it off.

4
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,569
Oh!

5
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,602
I guess I did. Sorry.

6
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,606
Psst! Hey, Mr. Clean!

7
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,572
Yo, rap master Danny!

8
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,590
Hey, stupid!

9
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:26,579
I love a man who knows his limitations.

10
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:29,574
- What you listening to? - My walkman.

11
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,567
Sounded like Voodoo Connection.

12
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,567
Oh, I'd sure like to hear a cut off of their new album.

13
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,597
I don't think so. I'm not even supposed to be talking to you.

14
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,562
Yeah, you're not even supposed to be listening to music

15
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:43,602
but you are.

16
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,606
Wait! Don't go. Talk to me.

17
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:56,566
It's so boring in here. So lonely.

18
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,572
I've been waiting for someone like you to come along.

19
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,567
Someone to help me shake things up a little.

20
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,562
W-What do you want me to do?

21
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:06,570
How about a little music for Livewire?

22
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,582
Just to get me in the mood.

23
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,603
Sure. Why not?

24
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,567
Whoa!

25
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,601
Thanks, danny boy. That's all I needed.

26
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:31,585
Hey, these batteries are dead.

27
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,581
Ooh!

28
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:38,588
Let's see if they're rechargeable.

29
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,565
Aah!

30
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:46,601
Oh.

31
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:49,597
Lights out!

32
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,567
Hey, hey, come on!

33
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,588
Hey, watch out!

34
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:29,603
Later, chumps.

35
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:39,573
And as I told Superman.

36
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,579
The SCU will be mobilized within the hour

37
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:44,562
and ready to move out at a moment's notice.

38
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:45,566
- Dan! - Hey, Turp!

39
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,560
Inspector, is the SCU

40
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,564
really prepared to deal with Livewire?

41
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,565
If that short circuit shows her mug

42
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,572
anywhere in this town, I will personally...

43
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:56,601
Pucker up and plant a big wet one right on her lips.

44
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:06,585
Mmm!

45
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,604
Wow!

46
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,573
Now, where's my real date?

47
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,575
Looking for me, Livewire?

48
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:23,599
Well-timed, superjerk. Let's rock!

49
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,588
Oh!

50
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,591
You're just delaying the inevitable, Superman.

51
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,591
What do you want?

52
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:56,603
That's right, let's get to the heart of the matter.

53
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,564
I want justice.

54
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:04,573
I want revenge.

55
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,599
I want your life!

56
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Ugh!

57
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:19,583
Why won't you die?

58
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:50,583
Aah!

59
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:02,573
Uh, uh, uh. Not this time, superjerk.

60
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:04,570
But I'll be back, and next time

61
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,587
I'll find a way to take you out... permanently!

62
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:21,563
Okay, folks, let's see if he'll..

63
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:24,574
Ha, by golly, he's really doing it.

64
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,586
He's drinking milk out of his owner's mouth.

65
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,557
- Bow-wow, Rudy. - Huh?

66
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,560
Is this the bone they threw you?

67
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,579
A big TV?

68
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,594
How'd you like to have some real laughs?

69
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,570
Poor little parasite.

70
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,558
I've been where you are.

71
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:58,558
Locked away in a cell. All alone.

72
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:01,559
No one to see. No one to touch.

73
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,599
And all because of Superman.

74
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:07,566
Superman.

75
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,561
But we could take care of him, you and I.

76
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:12,560
And then when we're done

77
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:14,569
maybe I'll give you a little taste..

78
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:16,600
Of my power, I mean.

79
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:20,582
Yeah. S-sure. Whatever you say.

80
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,557
- Oh, baby! - Hey, good-looking!

81
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,573
- Come on to my house. - Whoo! Come to me, baby.

82
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,576
- Over here. Come here, kid. - Oh, I'm the one!

83
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,574
Hi, boys. Wanna make sparks fly?

84
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:45,594
- Certainly, honey! - Charge me up, baby.

85
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:01,600
I just keep going and going and going.

86
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,593
Huh?

87
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:12,600
Aah!

88
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:19,574
Ha!

89
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:22,578
Don't play with your food now.

90
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,586
Oh!

91
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:37,565
Do you know how to pilot one of those?

92
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,591
Not yet, but I'm a fast learner.

93
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:43,592
Aah!

94
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:50,560
You know where to go.

95
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,583
Ain't you comin'?

96
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,596
I don't do boats.

97
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,574
- Too loud for you? - No.

98
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:12,573
It's just that every time I see something electric

99
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,597
I keep thinking she's going to pop out.

100
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,592
That sounds like it's coming from Strykers.

101
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,583
I'd better find a phone.

102
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,574
Here, we can use mine.

103
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,586
Clark?

104
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:35,589
Clark?

105
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,564
- Superman! - Sorry, Rudy.

106
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:51,564
I'm canceling your early release.

107
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:52,598
Aah!

108
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:02,589
Oh, no, you don't.

109
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,577
Give it up, Rudy. You're only hurting yourself.

110
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,581
Oh!

111
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:15,560
So, that's the plan, my purple people eater.

112
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:18,555
I force Superman into your grip

113
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:19,779
then you drain away his powers

114
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,570
leaving him just conscious enough

115
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:24,591
to watch me deliver the final blow!

116
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,597
Auck! Uou smell like fish.

117
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:31,552
So? Hold your nose.

118
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:34,572
Uh-uh, you can look, but don't touch.

119
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:38,554
Don't be afraid. I know how to control my power.

120
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,577
That's what they all say.

121
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:54,571
You stupid sleaze! I'm pure electricity.

122
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,564
186,000 miles per second.

123
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:00,586
If I say no, it means no!

124
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:07,559
Now, don't stay up too late, Rud-ster.

125
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,580
Remember, we gotta stay charged for the S-man. <i>Ciao.</i>

126
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,564
How do you like this?

127
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,568
The fun couple makes the front page

128
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,559
even when they're lying low.

129
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,572
How does it look out there?

130
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,596
It's going to get worse before it gets better.

131
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:48,561
Well, I'm going over to SCU Headquarters anyway.

132
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,558
See if Maggie Sawyer can give me more than the official line.

133
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,587
- Wanna come? - No, I think I'll just stay.

134
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,592
What?

135
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,567
Alright, maybe it's not the latest word in rainwear.

136
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,593
But nothing beats a plain old plastic poncho.

137
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,560
It won't take long for the cops to get here.

138
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,570
Even less for blue boy.

139
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,593
Just enough time to juice up.

140
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:55,589
Aah!

141
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:01,595
Knock it off. Can't you see I'm eating?

142
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:25,584
Look, Rudy, dessert!

143
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:37,592
Get him!

144
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:42,587
Hey, he's covered.

145
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,550
Well, what do you know? The boy scout brought protection.

146
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:54,555
That ain't fair.

147
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,563
I didn't realize there were rules.

148
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:58,580
Tear it off!

149
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,590
Ah!

150
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,576
Rudy, the tank!

151
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,593
Ah!

152
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,571
Super sorbet.

153
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,593
Uh-oh, do not use if plastic seal is broken.

154
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:51,572
Aah!

155
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,585
Ha-ha!

156
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,581
That's it. Drain him!

157
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,554
Not too much, idiot. I want him left standing.

158
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:05,574
I know what I'm doing.

159
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:13,553
Yeah, blue boy, this has been a long time coming.

160
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:15,586
Get ready to snap, crackle, and pop.

161
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,810
Hey, what do you think you're..

162
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:28,561
I want him alive so I can keep feeding off him.

163
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:29,593
And you, too.

164
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,588
You said no to me for the last time, baby.

165
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:45,572
Oh, no, you don't.

166
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,555
Hey, Superman!

167
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,564
Or should I call you Clark?

168
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,555
I remember now.

169
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:49,555
In fact, I remember everything about you.

170
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,548
How's that pretty little colleague of yours?

171
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:53,591
Lois, right?

172
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:58,579
Aah!

173
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,586
I was going to do this nicely, but give 'em an inch..

174
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:25,548
The janitor's closet. Dead end, Superman.

175
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,572
Believe me, I know.

176
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,572
Oh, now I'm scared.

177
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:46,582
No!

178
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,554
You bungling idiot!

179
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,553
We could've had it all. All!

180
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:17,562
Look at me, you dolt.

181
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:20,553
This is the face that's going to destroy you.

182
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,551
You hear me, eggplant?

183
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,547
Don't waste your breath, Sparky.

184
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,931
Parasite don't even know who he is.

185
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,582
It's a good bet he ain't gonna remember you.

186
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:33,555
Do you think he'll ever remember?

187
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,587
Nah, he's oatmeal.

188
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:39,550
You, uh, need a lift?

189
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,562
No, thanks. I'm feeling stronger.

190
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,590
And it's a nice night for flying.
