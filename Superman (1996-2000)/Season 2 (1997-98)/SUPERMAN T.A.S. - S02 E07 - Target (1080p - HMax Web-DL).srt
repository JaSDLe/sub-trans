1
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:10,497
And the nominees for the Excalibur Award

2
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,595
for outstanding investigative journalism

3
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,588
are Patrice Bandi for her article

4
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:17,616
on illegal drug traffic..

5
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:23,611
Mike Hart for his expose on diet fraud.

6
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,590
Julian Frey for his piece.

7
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:30,599
"No Profit like Nonprofit."

8
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,576
Good luck, Julian.

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,592
And Lois Lane for "Lex-scam, Nuclear Danger."

10
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:39,605
You, too, my dear.

11
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:43,602
And the award goes to..

12
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:50,600
Lois Lane.

13
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,611
Lois. Go up.

14
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:06,570
Did you hear that?

15
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,573
Yes. I can hardly believe it, either.

16
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:11,603
As if her ego weren't big enough already.

17
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:20,573
Ladies and gentlemen of the Metropolis Press

18
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:21,583
uh, colleagues..

19
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,573
I'd like to thank the Excalibur committee

20
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,568
for nominating my work.

21
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,232
I-I would also like to thank the members

22
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,570
of the Daily Planet editorial department

23
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:33,587
and the entire support staff for their invaluable help

24
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,572
locating and compiling the data for this article.

25
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:39,570
I would also like to congratulate

26
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,586
my fellow nominees..

27
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,569
Oh, please.

28
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:47,566
Oops. Better go wash this out before it stains.

29
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,568
When corruption or waste or fraud is uncovered

30
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:53,580
we all win.

31
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:57,593
Thank you, all. I will treasure..

32
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,567
Hmm. Some kind of electro-gizmo.

33
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,578
It looks like it's got a...

34
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,563
When did you join the force?

35
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,572
This is police business.

36
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:25,604
When we have information

37
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,564
you'll get it along with all the other reporters.

38
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:31,565
I'm not just "one of the other reporters."

39
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:33,572
This was an attempt on my life, you know.

40
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:35,567
You really want to be helpful?

41
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,567
Try making a list of the people

42
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,568
who might want to see you dead.

43
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:41,599
And try to keep it to one page.

44
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,561
What do you think the chances are

45
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,572
of Bowman actually solving this case?

46
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:57,577
What's his problem?

47
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,560
Oh, about two years ago

48
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,572
I wrote an expose on police corruption.

49
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,564
It cost him a promotion.

50
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,562
He's had it in for me ever since.

51
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:06,589
Careful!

52
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,568
Don't worry, Kent. I'm always in control.

53
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:13,572
If you want, I'd be happy to stay

54
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,586
at your apartment tonight.

55
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,556
Somebody <i>did try</i> to kill you.

56
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,561
And he failed. Look, Kent

57
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:23,563
I'm not worried. You shouldn't be, either.

58
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:26,554
And now a very special request.

59
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:27,567
Is there anything else on?

60
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,599
Paldoverdi's version of "You Win, You Die."

61
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:32,560
It won't change.

62
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,561
Dedicated to Lois Lane.

63
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,561
Yes, Lois, you.

64
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:38,568
What a shame that an innocent party like Mr. Kent

65
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:42,555
must also suffer, but you never were one

66
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,579
to let an innocent stand in your way.

67
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,567
What are you doing?

68
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,579
Getting us out of here.

69
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,561
Whoa!

70
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,572
Clark!

71
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,555
Oh, no, you don't, Lois.

72
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,587
Ohh!

73
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:19,550
Are you alright?

74
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,543
- Yes, but, Clark... - He's fine.

75
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,574
I was able to cushion his fall.

76
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,573
A little something for your insurance agent.

77
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,552
Arm still hurting?

78
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:45,543
Mm. About the same as yesterday.

79
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,556
I still think we should've taken it to the police first.

80
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,550
Oh, yeah. I'm sure Detective Bowman won't rest

81
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,576
till he finds out where this came from.

82
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:57,539
At least I know Edward Lytener will be helpful.

83
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:58,557
Yes, yes, what is it?

84
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,558
Oh, yes. Very helpful, I'm sure.

85
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:04,564
It's me, Eddie. Lois?

86
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:08,546
Lois! Lois Lane! Of course!

87
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,581
Of course.

88
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:28,545
I wouldn't. Ten gigawatts. Real nasty shock.

89
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,557
I'm really sorry to bother you like this.

90
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,553
It's no bother. I've been in this lab

91
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,547
for 24 hours straight without looking up.

92
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,560
I could use the break. And the company.

93
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,540
The circuit patterns are lot like what they're working on

94
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:42,555
over at LexCorp R&D.

95
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,535
How do you know that?

96
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,759
Eddie used to work for Luthor.

97
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,534
He was my informant on the lex-scam article.

98
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:50,542
By the way, Lois, congratulations.

99
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,534
Yeah. Thanks.

100
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,555
Hello. What's this?

101
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,553
"L.C."

102
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,542
It's from LexCorp, alright.

103
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,606
Somebody there must really have it in for you, Lois.

104
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:22,575
Another in a long line of killing machines.

105
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,532
It's not as much fun when you're on the receiving end.

106
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:27,547
I heard about the regrettable incident

107
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,547
at the Excalibur Awards.

108
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:33,539
Yes. And this little goodie was in my car.

109
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,573
I have evidence it was manufactured here at LexCorp.

110
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,536
Really, Lois, I wouldn't leave so blatant a trail

111
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,534
even if I were out to get you.

112
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:43,538
And you're not?

113
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,544
No. Why would I be?

114
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,572
I respect you and what you do

115
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,573
even when you're taking potshots at my company.

116
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:52,534
But the device...

117
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:54,546
This disturbs me as much as it does you.

118
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,530
If it came from LexCorp

119
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:58,539
I'll find out how it ended up in your car.

120
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,534
I promise.

121
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:02,542
Trust me, Lois.

122
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,570
Trust him? Why would you do that?

123
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:07,536
He's just trying to keep you from nosing around LexCorp.

124
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,528
Probably. But I believed him

125
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:10,543
when he said he wasn't behind it.

126
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,545
The way this assassin keeps warning me

127
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,570
it's like he wants me to suffer first.

128
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,569
That's weird, but it's not Lex.

129
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,546
Lois, my dear. Perry has just handed me

130
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,535
some of your, uh, overdue assignments.

131
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,543
What?

132
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,527
He was worried about you falling behind.

133
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,543
I certainly hope I can come up

134
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,569
to your, uh, award-winning standards.

135
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:34,552
I'm sure you will.

136
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:45,560
Great.

137
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:50,526
You're not safe, Lois, not outside

138
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,521
not in your car, not even here at work.

139
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:54,865
I'll give you exactly one minute

140
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,554
to prepare to meet your maker.

141
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:05,553
Uhh!

142
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:12,563
Uh, uh, uh.

143
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:17,531
Ohh!

144
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:18,537
Uhh..

145
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:19,563
Oh!

146
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,558
Uhh!

147
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,558
Aah!

148
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,696
I believe this is your floor.

149
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,530
I'm not having a good day.

150
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,505
Uhh! Uhh..

151
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,526
Uhh!

152
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:16,504
Uhh! Uhh!

153
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,532
Uhh! Aah!

154
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,503
I just hate this. I can't sleep, I can't eat.

155
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,509
I feel so... helpless.

156
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,502
- Why don't you just relax? - I can't relax.

157
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:13,446
I feel like I should be out there doing something

158
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,497
not sitting here wondering

159
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,508
what everybody else is up to.

160
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,496
It feels... wrong.

161
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,505
Why? Let other people take the risks for you for a change.

162
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,496
The world can get by without Lois Lane for a couple of days.

163
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,504
Yeah, just enough time for Julian to steal

164
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:29,506
all my stories and my byline.

165
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,502
Oh, by the way, Angela Chen called.

166
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:33,506
She heard about your award on the news last night

167
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,499
and wanted to congratulate you.

168
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:36,512
On the news, huh?

169
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,496
You know, Clark, maybe you're right.

170
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,503
Let everyone else take care of things.

171
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:42,510
That's the spirit.

172
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,506
In fact, I think I'll go relax

173
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,498
in a nice hot bath right now.

174
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,531
See ya.

175
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,497
- I got a couple more hours. - Oh?

176
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,721
My shift will be over by 10:00.

177
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,526
- Maybe we could get together. - Okay.

178
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,503
I thought if we put our heads together

179
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,501
we could figure out who's behind this.

180
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,511
Of course, I hate to be taking you away

181
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,496
from your work again, Eddie.

182
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,508
Not at all, Lois.

183
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,508
I'm happy to help in any way I can.

184
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:16,494
By the way, what were you working on

185
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,495
so hard the other night?

186
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,513
Shh. Top secret.

187
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,508
You certainly have the most amazing collection of gadgets.

188
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,533
But... no TV? No radio?

189
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,493
Never. They're a wasteland

190
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,837
of call-in drivel and news trivia.

191
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,830
It would just break my concentra..

192
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,499
What is it?

193
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:38,487
You know, don't you?

194
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,511
Know what?

195
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,504
Tell me, Lois how did you figure it out?

196
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:50,490
You congratulated me on my award, remember?

197
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,487
If you were cooped up in this lab all night

198
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:53,497
with no TV or radio

199
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,502
then how did you know I'd won the Excalibur?

200
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:58,515
Such a clever girl.

201
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:02,499
Hello.

202
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:05,500
Kent. I was hoping to speak to Lois.

203
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,484
She's not here.

204
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,528
Then take a note.

205
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:10,505
I've traced the materials she was asking about.

206
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,504
It was part of a lot that went missing from inventory

207
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:16,502
right after her little snitch Lytener was fired.

208
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,489
Did you get that, Kent?

209
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:22,491
Hello? Hello?

210
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,482
Eddie, why are you doing this?

211
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:25,492
What have I ever done to you?

212
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,497
That's just it. You never did anything for me.

213
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,485
And I risked it all

214
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,492
my job, my reputation, my research.

215
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:34,492
I knew what would happen if Lex found out.

216
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:36,797
You blew the whistle because it was the right thing to do.

217
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:38,499
Wrong! I blew the whistle

218
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:40,494
because I wanted you to notice me.

219
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:43,513
You didn't. But you will now.

220
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,486
Daddy was a black belt.

221
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,490
You're an unusual woman, Lois.

222
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,520
That's why I've taken unusual measures.

223
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:05,498
A little trap I designed for your apartment.

224
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:08,503
You see, you wouldn't have been safe anywhere.

225
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,506
Superman!

226
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:14,521
Aah!

227
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,485
I was expecting you to show up.

228
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,482
After all, if Lois Lane is in danger

229
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,485
can Superman be far behind?

230
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,497
Let her out of there, Lytener.

231
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,489
You're in no position to make demands, Superman.

232
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,510
Let her out, or I 'll...

233
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,515
Aah!

234
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,509
Unh!

235
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,520
Uhh!

236
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:41,494
This is my favorite invention

237
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,495
a project I began at LexLabs, actually.

238
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,475
It's powered by the solar energy spectrum of a red sun.

239
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,518
Uhh!

240
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,478
Aah!

241
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:54,488
That's why the punches pack such a wallop

242
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:56,513
particularly for you, Superman.

243
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:01,509
Uhh! Ahh!

244
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,500
Unhh!

245
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,515
Aah!

246
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,495
Ohh! Aah! Ooh!

247
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,510
Superman! The controls!

248
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:53,476
Are you okay?

249
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,492
A little extra crispy, but otherwise fine.

250
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:05,486
Tell me something.

251
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,470
How do you always manage

252
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,474
to arrive just in the nick of time?

253
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:10,482
It's a gift.

254
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:13,475
You wouldn't be keeping an eye on me or anything?

255
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:17,482
Well... some people need more watching than others.

256
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,490
Thanks.

257
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,468
Someday, though, it'd be nice to see you

258
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,493
when I wasn't about to be killed.

259
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,487
Someday.
