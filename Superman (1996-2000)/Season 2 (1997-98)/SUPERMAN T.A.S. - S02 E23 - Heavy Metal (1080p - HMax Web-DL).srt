1
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:33,764
This is a lot lighter than the last one, Uncle John.

2
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:36,269
You ready to go out and whup some bad guys now?

3
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,533
Got to do more testing, Nate. Lots more.

4
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,702
But that's all you've been doing ever since you quit working for Mr. Luthor.

5
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:45,677
Grandma and I hardly ever see you anymore.

6
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:48,874
Once I get it right, things'll be different.

7
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:52,453
- Back to the way they were before? - Yeah, except for the Luthor part.

8
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,287
- You gonna be home for dinner tonight? - What are we having?

9
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,624
Pork chops and bean curd in a cilantro sauce.

10
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:05,633
Hey, you're the one who bought Grandma a California cuisine cookbook.

11
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:09,033
Maybe I should be building myself a cast iron stomach.

12
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,837
<i>We interrupt this program to bring you a channel six special bulletin.</i>

13
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,843
<i>Now from our studios in Metropolis, the Six Scene news team.</i>

14
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,847
<i>Daily Planet media reporter Angela Chen has just located a witness...</i>

15
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,781
<i>to today's multimillion dollar diamond district robbery.</i>

16
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:26,445
<i>- We go to her now, live. Angela? - This is nonfat decaf, right?</i>

17
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,854
<i>- I don't wanna be up half the night again. - Angela, you're on.</i>

18
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:34,896
<i>Yes, Angela Chen here, and I've just found a witness to the robbery.</i>

19
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:39,023
<i>His name is Mr. "B. Bibbowski."</i>

20
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,729
<i>Exactly what did you see today, Mr. Bibbowski?</i>

21
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,265
<i>Oh, yeah. I couldn't believe it.</i>

22
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,171
<i>This guy in a mask, see...</i>

23
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:50,711
<i>he comes over to the side of the bank and he gives it a karate chop.</i>

24
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,645
<i>Bam! Just like kung fu.</i>

25
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:56,809
<i>Are you saying that was done by one karate chop?</i>

26
00:02:56,986 --> 00:03:01,651
<i>Yeah. That mook was almost as strong as my favorite guy, Superman.</i>

27
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:05,955
<i>You know, I remember one time we was fighting this big monkey...</i>

28
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:11,066
<i>Well, there you have it. One witness but no suspects in this fast-breaking story.</i>

29
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,931
<i>Angela, we understand from earlier reports that this super strong thief...</i>

30
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:16,572
<i>may have ties to Intergang.</i>

31
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,401
<i>- Really? - Cut!</i>

32
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,567
Superman was right. Plenty of crime to go around.

33
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,249
How about a little target practice before dinner?

34
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,858
All right, everybody. Down!

35
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:49,665
I don't know the combination. Really. I don't even have key to the men's room.

36
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,171
Shut up!

37
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,823
- Hey, we could use a hand here. - I don't do grunt work.

38
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:16,761
You do what we say. You owe us.

39
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:20,501
After today, I'll owe you nothing.

40
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,211
I'll catch up.

41
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,983
Let's go!

42
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:44,182
Whoa. That's one part of the suit that doesn't need any more testing.

43
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,363
- Wait here. - Hey!

44
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:04,973
Tell Grandma we're gonna be late for dinner.

45
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:32,560
Gonna have to address this problem. Maybe later.

46
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,383
Look, it's a dead Samaritan. Say good night, chump.

47
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,610
Good night, chump.

48
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:00,525
That's putting out the trash, Superman.

49
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,187
My pleasure, Mr. Irons.

50
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:05,425
Guess you really do know him, Uncle John.

51
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,194
Working on the prototype again?

52
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,770
You said if it could work you'd be glad for the help.

53
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,569
And I meant it. But be careful. You're not invulnerable, you know.

54
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,267
Well, I'm working on that too.

55
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:19,278
Hey, look!

56
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:25,949
Time to throw in the old towel. You were just too much for us.

57
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:41,798
Metallo.

58
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,408
In the flesh.

59
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:57,436
My new friends from Intergang found me right where you left me.

60
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:00,269
Dug me out and fixed me up as good as new.

61
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:02,911
Some might say better.

62
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,493
Keeping your distance. Wise, but pointless, I'm afraid.

63
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:01,803
My friends at Intergang have done much more than a simple repair job.

64
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,964
They've also added a few improvements.

65
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:13,439
- Get to the van. - But, Uncle... Now!

66
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:22,817
You don't expect me to walk all the way up there, do you?

67
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:33,302
Remember how you left me, Superman? Buried in rock.

68
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:38,634
I couldn't move. I couldn't see. I couldn't hear. But I could think.

69
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:42,476
And all I thought about was how I was going to make you pay.

70
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:47,275
Goodbye, hero.

71
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,316
YoU still here?

72
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,988
- A lovely shade of chartreuse. - You can't.

73
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,461
You ought to be paying attention, my friend.

74
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,570
The tabloids will be all over you.

75
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:13,505
You're about to become famous: "The man who watched Superman die."

76
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:49,367
- We have to go after them. - How? The truck is toast.

77
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:53,915
Here comes our ride now.

78
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,548
We've got company.

79
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,759
- Better let me drive. - No time, Uncle John.

80
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,267
Nate, what are you...?

81
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:18,029
Uncle John, we're out of gas.

82
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,600
Must have busted the fuel line when you hit Metallo.

83
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,705
- I'll remember to aim better next time. - You did great.

84
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,643
Need some help, sister?

85
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,370
I could make it run good.

86
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:34,744
All I want you to make is some space.

87
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,343
- Coming through. - Hey, who's he got there?

88
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,250
- It's Superman. - Superman.

89
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:41,913
You sure you don't need help?

90
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,252
Well, I could use a head start.

91
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:47,760
- Somebody call the police. - Somebody help him. Call an ambulance.

92
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:51,764
- Something happened to him. - Where's he going with him?

93
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:11,778
- What's that? - It's a full-spectrum light generator.

94
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,218
I'm gonna give him intensified yellow sunlight.

95
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,723
Might help him recover, if it's not too late.

96
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,255
Finally. Go tell them about Superman.

97
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:26,458
- I don't think so. - What's the matter with you?

98
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:30,230
Officer! Hey, officer! We've got an emergency...

99
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:34,642
- Indeed you do, madam. - What is this?

100
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:43,115
All right, people. Where's Superman?

101
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:54,087
Watch out!

102
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:59,165
Somebody speak up or I'll tear this neighborhood apart...

103
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,495
brick by brick.

104
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:04,002
We got nothing to say to you, Robobutt.

105
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:38,166
- Uncle John, what are we gonna do? - You're staying here with Superman.

106
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:41,104
Where are you going?

107
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,943
For a test drive.

108
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:05,861
Want me to do that to you? Now, where's Superman?

109
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,504
Try the planet Krypton.

110
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:15,409
I'm going to ask you one last time. Where is he?

111
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,415
There's a good lad.

112
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:34,622
Looks like the erector set's got a big brother.

113
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:40,299
- Well, what have we here? - Call me...

114
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:41,527
Steel.

115
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:45,299
Steel, Metallo. The meeting of the metals.

116
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:50,036
Well then, Mr. Steel, may the best alloy win.

117
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:31,752
Yeah!

118
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:01,648
Don't think I'm going to be as easy as my men, Steel.

119
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:31,673
Sorry, Steel, I've still got some business in the 'hood.

120
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:44,782
Come on, Superman, this ain't no tanning salon.

121
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:53,526
Nice air show, Superfly, but I have a few aerobic moves of my own.

122
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:31,137
A hammer. Nice touch.

123
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,475
Bet you think you've got me. Well, surprise.

124
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:53,119
He's got Superman. He's gonna kill him.

125
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:56,290
Not on my watch he's not.

126
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:07,737
No escape, Superman. Not this time.

127
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,435
You can drown me. You can bury me.

128
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,547
You can send your foot soldiers to do your dirty work...

129
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:17,413
but I can take anything you can throw at me. Anything.

130
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:19,950
Yo, Metallo. Take this!

131
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,304
- He got him. - Yeah.

132
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,310
- Look. - That was the end of him.

133
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,508
Hey, Steel!

134
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:55,653
Steel, huh?

135
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,883
Well, Steel, you're gonna be getting this a lot...

136
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,154
so you might as well hear it from me first.

137
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,991
What?

138
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:04,164
Thanks.

139
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:45,396
