1
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,942
<i>Previously on</i> Superman:

2
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:09,882
You owe me an explanation-

3
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,488
Look, I've still got half the Kryptonite-

4
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,249
I still can finish the job-

5
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:17,588
Keep in mind, this is your last chance-

6
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,491
Does this mean you and Bruce...?

7
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,956
We haven't made a formal commitment or anything, but...

8
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,102
yeah, it's that serious-

9
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:23,591
This could be a fair fight after all, and who wants to see that?

10
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,908
Evening, Ms-Lane-Where's Mr-Kent?

11
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,247
- Probably out husking some corn- <i>- Miss Lane?</i>

12
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,151
Yeah, I'm still here-

13
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,023
Superman's towing the ship to harbor?

14
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,855
Can you find out how close he is? Yeah, I'll hold-

15
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,504
Let me guess-You're the only one here-

16
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,747
Is there something I should know?

17
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:14,337
- How do I contact Superman? - He's out at sea-

18
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,330
Never around when you need him-

19
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:28,446
Stay here-I'm the one it's after-

20
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,025
Bruce?

21
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,469
So when were you gonna tell me? The honeymoon?

22
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,210
Stay back-

23
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,225
Did I miss anything?

24
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:48,631
<i>Reports indicate target acquisition negative, Mr. Luthor, sorry.</i>

25
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:55,105
He survived-He lasted long enough for Superman to save him-

26
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,571
- Then they have the robot- - I know-

27
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,336
- But, Lex, they'll trace it back to you... - I know!

28
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,982
Call the clown-I need one last meeting-

29
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,996
How could you have lied to me like that?

30
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,431
Now, I never actually said I wasn't Batman-

31
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,464
You wanna know what really galls me? I mean, beside the fact...

32
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:25,872
that the new man in my life is really two men?

33
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:30,879
It's that I'm sitting on the hottest story of the year, "Batman Unmasked"...

34
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,812
and there's not a blessed thing I can do about it-

35
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,946
Then you really do love me-

36
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:38,554
I'll get some iodine for that scrape-

37
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:42,957
Burning, stinging iodine-

38
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,196
I see she's taking it well-

39
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,594
It's ironic, you know-

40
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,202
She likes Bruce Wayne and she likes Superman-

41
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,668
It's the other two guys she's not crazy about-

42
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:56,966
Too bad we can't mix-and-match-

43
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:00,373
I'm not used to being rescued-

44
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,979
- Thanks- - I owed you one-

45
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:07,150
That robot tonight, it came from Lexcorp- I can prove it-

46
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,685
That's why I'm here-I figured you might want to help me bring Luthor in-

47
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:13,187
A partnership? You're joking-

48
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,792
I'm having trouble finding Luthor and I thought...

49
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,951
you might have some ideas- - I might-

50
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,290
She's not gonna like this, me leaving so soon...

51
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,592
for another fight- - Tell me about it-

52
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,397
That cut on your shoulder looked pretty nasty, Bruce-

53
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,437
I know a good doctor who...

54
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,842
Oh, no-

55
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,209
Has to be done-

56
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:39,645
I don't suppose a stern lecture on unnecessary risk-taking...

57
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,649
is going to sway you-

58
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:45,545
- Sorry- - I didn't think so-Just be...

59
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,122
Careful-

60
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:53,387
Look at all the toys-

61
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:56,398
Santa's been good to you, Lex-

62
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,536
Joker, we've got serious problems-

63
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:08,637
A flying wing! Twenty times bigger than Batman's...

64
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:11,475
and, knowing you, a hundred times as lethal-

65
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:15,278
Joker! Did you bring the rest of the Kryptonite?

66
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:18,422
Right here, chrome-dome- What's the plan?

67
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:19,989
Payback-

68
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,387
What's so funny?

69
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:30,497
Don't you get it, Harl? We're being set up to take the fall-

70
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,158
He can't do that-

71
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:35,101
Oh, no? How does this sound?

72
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:39,334
When I heard that one of my robots had been commandeered to kill Batman...

73
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,945
I personally came here to investigate, and much to my surprise...

74
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:45,844
I found you two-

75
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:50,545
It'll be your word against pudding's- I mean, Mr-J's-

76
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:54,351
Somehow, Pooh, I don't think we're gonna get the chance to say much-

77
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,120
You mean he's gonna kill us?

78
00:08:57,461 --> 00:09:01,956
No, she is-I abhor violence-

79
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:12,108
Now, this is funny, Mr-J, except we're never gonna collect...

80
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:13,801
our billion bucks now-

81
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:19,109
True, but I see a delightful consolation prize-

82
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,015
Nothing like a nice big smile-

83
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,593
- All done- - I love to personalize all my stuff-

84
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,728
Very amusing-

85
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:42,463
So how much is it going to cost me to get out of this?

86
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,509
I'm not a material guy, Lexy- No, what I want now is for you...

87
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:51,171
to know what it feels like to lose everything you have-

88
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:55,945
Everything you've ever built- Like I lost everything to old Batboy-

89
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:03,851
<i>We have incoming. Bats and fly boy.</i>

90
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:07,020
I'll be right in-Bye-bye-

91
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,678
- See anything? - Luthor's been lining his buildings...

92
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:33,016
with lead- It blocks my x-ray vision-

93
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:35,224
Well, there's always the direct approach-

94
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,298
You're learning-

95
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,200
A little distraction would be useful right now...

96
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,368
wouldn't you say, Lexy?

97
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:14,160
I think your toys can handle this by themselves-

98
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:18,291
Besides, I'd hate to spoil my new paint job-

99
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:22,230
Now, let's see here-Ignition-

100
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,281
Couldn't have done it better myself-

101
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:03,616
Helps if you're prepared-

102
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:50,901
Where's Luthor?

103
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,966
Joker took him in the Lexwing-

104
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,631
He said he'd make him lose everything he ever built-

105
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:58,203
Luthor's built half of Metropolis-

106
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,979
Go after The Joker-I shouldn't be long-

107
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:35,170
How's it feel, Lexy boy? Everything with your name on it...

108
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:36,839
is going to be rubble-

109
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:04,137
Batman-It's always Batman-

110
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:07,037
What do you got in the way of air-to-air missiles, Lex?

111
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,148
You're asking me for help?

112
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:12,308
If I go down, you go down-

113
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:13,885
It's a red switch-

114
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,980
Which red...? Oh, the heck with it-

115
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:34,160
Lead-lined door- I'll have to thank Luthor-

116
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,465
Who's flying this thing?

117
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:17,541
Do something, for God's sake!

118
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:21,276
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo-

119
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:57,316
It's gonna blow! I'll get Quinn, you take Luthor-

120
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,192
- Pudding- - At this point, he probably is-

121
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,450
<i>Hello, this is Angela Chen.</i>

122
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,026
<i>Though the search for Joker's body continues...</i>

123
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,663
<i>the Coast Guard reports it is extremely unlikely...</i>

124
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,323
<i>that Gotham's most notorious criminal survived the crash.</i>

125
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,097
<i>In related news, billionaire Lex Luthor was again rigorously grilled...</i>

126
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:29,868
<i>by the DA's office over his alleged connection to The Joker's rampage.</i>

127
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:33,206
<i>His statements have been questioned both by local law officials...</i>

128
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,109
<i>and industrialist, Bruce Wayne...</i>

129
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:39,514
<i>who announced immediate termination of his partnership with Lexcorp.</i>

130
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:41,244
<i>And on a lighter note...</i>

131
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,549
<i>Joker accomplice Harley Quinn was returned to Arkham Asylum...</i>

132
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,954
<i>for another round of rehabilitation.</i>

133
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:51,826
<i>I want a lawyer. I want a doctor. I want a cheese sandwich!</i>

134
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,532
Now that's funny-

135
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:00,863
I still wish you'd change your mind about Gotham-

136
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,568
I adore you, Bruce, but now there's a lot about you I don't know...

137
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:06,678
and I'm not sure I wanna know-

138
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:10,109
I understand-Take care of yourself-

139
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,891
Come to make sure I'm leaving?

140
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,396
Actually, I thought we worked well together-

141
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,834
Not that I wanna make it a regular event-

142
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:36,075
She's all yours now, if you can handle that-

143
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:38,768
But you'd better be good to her...

144
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:40,640
because I know where you live-

145
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,464
