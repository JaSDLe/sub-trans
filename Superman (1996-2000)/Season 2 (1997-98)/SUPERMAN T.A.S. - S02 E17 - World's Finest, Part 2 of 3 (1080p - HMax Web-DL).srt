1
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,013
<i>Previously on</i> Superman:

2
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:08,709
I just wanted to let you know I'll be in late tomorrow-

3
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,714
I'm having breakfast with Bruce-

4
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:11,888
Isn't that special-

5
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,284
He's very thoughtful and much deeper than the gossip mongers...

6
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,950
would lead you to believe-

7
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:18,454
You'd be surprised-

8
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,296
Where's The Joker?

9
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,097
Lexy, old kid-

10
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,993
Pay me one billion dollars, and I'll kill Superman-

11
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,935
The Joker has 20 pounds more where this came from-

12
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:36,008
You know I can't be connected to this in any way-

13
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
Deal?

14
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,777
Deal-

15
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:44,449
The senator...

16
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:49,190
declined comment-Done-

17
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,753
And not a moment too soon-

18
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,329
Bruce-When did you...?

19
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:56,558
About three paragraphs ago- I didn't wanna distract you-

20
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,327
Ready to do the town?

21
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:02,269
Give me a minute to see the chief, then I'm all yours-

22
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:06,240
Clark, keep an eye on Bruce, will you?

23
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,611
I'll be right back-

24
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:12,373
- Actually, Lois... - Don't be intimidated-

25
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,009
Regale him with madcap tales of the nightlife in Smallville-

26
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,147
She never stops, does she?

27
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:22,691
Not that I've noticed- Any luck finding the comedian?

28
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:26,356
Three nights, and not so much as a green hair-

29
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:29,691
Of course, you have been dividing your time between work and Lois-

30
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,199
Is that a problem?

31
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,538
Let's just say I'm concerned- Your reputation is dubious...

32
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,231
in and out of costume-

33
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:41,243
Don't worry- I'm taking Lois quite seriously-

34
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,780
Besides, it seems to me you had your chance-

35
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:48,645
So, Mr-Wayne, ready to sweep me off my feet?

36
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,947
Be seeing you-

37
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,939
This city is gorgeous at night-

38
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,769
Is it? I wasn't looking at the city-

39
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:19,745
Lois-About Clark Kent-Are you and he...?

40
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,385
I mean...

41
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,952
No, Bruce-Your only competition flew away some time ago-

42
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:31,724
My, you do live dangerously-

43
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,966
Don't you realize you're moving in on Superman's main squeeze?

44
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,695
And then I said...

45
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,641
They've got guns!

46
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,744
Take your hands off her, you...

47
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,836
See that he's street pizza-

48
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,938
In this town, some flying fool could have caught him-

49
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,671
Well, aren't we tenacious?

50
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,541
Catch you next time, Brucie-

51
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:10,791
Swell-Now Gotham's sending us their wackos-

52
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,160
Don't worry, Mr-Wayne-The SCU will get her back safe and sound-

53
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,692
Thank you, inspector-

54
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,570
- You realize she's just the bait- - I'll be careful-

55
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,802
Careful won't cut it- With Joker, expect the unexpected-

56
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,071
Maybe you should have remembered that-

57
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,820
Think of it, Miss Lane-

58
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,547
This rock is more precious than gold-

59
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:43,990
One teensy chip will go for thousands on the collectors' market...

60
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,795
after it kills your fly boy-

61
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:02,011
- You sick, demented, murdering freak! - How rude-

62
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,719
Half for now and half for later-

63
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,121
You've got a front row seat for the story of the century, my dear-

64
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,754
The death of Superman-

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,093
SCU, Turpin-

66
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,762
<i>Am-scray, turnip. I wanna talk to the boy in blue.</i>

67
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,101
You got something to say, clown, say it to...

68
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:08,871
I'm here, Joker-What have you done with Lois Lane?

69
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:11,344
<i>She's right here, Superman...</i>

70
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:14,541
<i>and she'd love to see you.</i>

71
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:19,315
<i>Want to know where here is? Don't blink.</i>

72
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:28,721
<i>Got the picture, Supey? Come alone.</i>

73
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,597
<i>No cops or little Lois dies laughing.</i>

74
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,603
Wait, what picture? What did he mean?

75
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,931
More powerful than a locomotive-

76
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:09,629
And just about as subtle-

77
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,611
I'm flattered you put on your Sunday best-

78
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,609
Where is she, Joker?

79
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,343
Forget about Lois-

80
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,683
Feast your eyes on this-

81
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,422
Now, I'll ask you once more-

82
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,198
I don't understand-

83
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:45,968
I had it all planned so perfectly-

84
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,644
- Oh, wait, that's it- - What?

85
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:57,117
Silly me-I forgot the acid-

86
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,768
What's the matter, Supey?

87
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,735
No steam left in the old locomotive?

88
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,701
I hope you're taking notes-

89
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,741
- Not now- <i>- But, pudding...</i>

90
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,903
<i>- Batman's headed your way.</i> - Get out-

91
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,754
Pardon my hasty exit- We have a pest control problem-

92
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,857
Feel free to expire any time-

93
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,822
I'll be back in a moment-

94
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,971
<i>Two for the price of one. I love it.</i>

95
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,472
<i>And the best part is...</i>

96
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:01,509
<i>you're all going out with a smile.</i>

97
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:04,238
<i>Have a happy...</i>

98
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:18,461
Hydrochloric acid-It would take a week to eat through the wall-

99
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:24,130
No-Wait-Kryp... Kryptonite-

100
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,450
Snap out of it, Kent-

101
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,519
Or Joker gets the last laugh-

102
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,120
Keep your heads down-

103
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,138
They're loose!

104
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,502
That's not fair-

105
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,215
It's over, Joker-

106
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:19,417
It hasn't begun, Supey-

107
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,056
He's gotta be kidding-

108
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:34,130
They're grenades- Expect the unexpected-

109
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,287
Thank you-I couldn't have saved Lois without your help-

110
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:53,650
I'm aware of that-

111
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:14,106
Bruce-Bruce Wayne- He was with me when Joker...

112
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,143
Is he all right? Do you know?

113
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,281
He's fine-Just fine-

114
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:31,916
I wish to assure all of Metropolis that this explosion was non-nuclear-

115
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,995
And presents no danger to the community-

116
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:39,494
- Now, if you'll excuse me- - Hey, what about The Joker, Mr-Luthor?

117
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:42,430
You heard the man-

118
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,169
What could have possessed me to trust that clown?

119
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:54,608
Hello, Mr-J-I'm Batman- Eat me, eat me, eat me!

120
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,419
I know you're trying to cheer me up, Harley-

121
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:02,783
But you see, any time I blow a billion-dollar deal...

122
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,950
it really kills my appetite!

123
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:29,207
Honestly, Lex, don't you think I feel bad enough already?

124
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,615
You maniac! You idiot!

125
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:34,485
How dare you use one of my laboratories...

126
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:35,052
Harley?

127
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:40,659
- Put him down, baldy- - Mercy-

128
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,666
Here's for that punch in the face-

129
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,701
Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?

130
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,609
Listen to little Miss Can't-Take-A-Joke-

131
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:59,314
Thank you-Have a seat, please-

132
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:03,084
Banzai!

133
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:09,286
You owe me an explanation-

134
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,289
The lab was a perfect set-up-

135
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,451
How did I know old bat-breath would show up?

136
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:17,261
Batman? He followed you to Metropolis?

137
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,663
Oh, right-Like it's my fault-

138
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,360
Look, I've still got half the Kryptonite-

139
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:24,062
I can still finish the job-

140
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,970
But if I have to cope with two men in tights...

141
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,668
the price goes up- - Unacceptable-

142
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:33,804
If you can't handle some mental case in a fright mask, our deal is off-

143
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,412
Mercy, let's go-

144
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:41,648
Keep in mind, this is your last chance-

145
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,524
How you doing, slugger?

146
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,829
A-okay, Mr-J-

147
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,908
Hey, Smallville-Come in-What's up?

148
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:10,249
I see you're holding up after last night-I've been...

149
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:15,450
I didn't realize you had company-

150
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:18,788
Whoa, you might at least tell me why you stopped by-

151
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,292
I've been nosing around-

152
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:23,465
I think I may know why The Joker is suddenly after Superman-

153
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,828
Well, don't keep us in suspense-

154
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:30,063
I think he's in cahoots with your boyfriend's business partner-

155
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,332
With Lex? Are you sure?

156
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:35,306
I can't prove it-Yet-

157
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:38,743
I suppose I could ask him-

158
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:51,356
What? Who?

159
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,430
- What do you want? - Information-

160
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,537
Regarding a mutual acquaintance-

161
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,071
What are you talking about? I don't know any...

162
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,905
You know exactly who I mean-

163
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:13,079
Where is he? What kind of deal have you made with him?

164
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:14,914
I don't...

165
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,847
- I... - Mr-Luthor-Are you all right?

166
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:18,350
- Who's in there? - Open up!

167
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,216
- He's in trouble- - The door's locked-

168
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,754
I don't have the keys-

169
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,061
Think about it-I'll be back-

170
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,426
All right, break it in-

171
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:40,108
- Mr-Luthor? - Get out-

172
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,018
Contact the clown immediately-

173
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:56,522
It appears we'll have to deal with his friend after all-

174
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:00,885
A transfer?

175
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,991
Just to the <i>Planet</i>'s Gotham City bureau-

176
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,130
Does this mean you and Bruce...?

177
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:10,538
We haven't made a formal commitment or anything, but...

178
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,697
yeah, it's that serious-

179
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:16,039
Hey, chin up, Smallville- With me out of the picture...

180
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,839
you might get a shot at stardom-

181
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,412
Lois! Clark!

182
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:21,943
I just got word the cruise ship <i>S.S. Atlantis...</i>

183
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:24,586
is sending a distress call 200 miles offshore-

184
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,724
Exactly-Call the Coast Guard to confirm and the cruise line for a statement-

185
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,554
You're not out of here yet, Lane-

186
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,021
What the devil is he up to now?

187
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,385
A change of attire, sir?

188
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,925
How fast can we get to Hobbs Bay?

189
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,006
If I may be so bold- When in Rome, sir...

190
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:32,852
- What's the problem, captain? - What do you mean?

191
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,013
You sent out a distress call, didn't you?

192
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:38,087
Not on my authorization-

193
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:46,928
There's the culprit- It's broadcasting an electronic beacon-

194
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:50,094
If one of my crew is responsible for this prank, they...

195
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,236
What is it? What's happening?

196
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:04,718
Whoever sent that distress signal...

197
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,212
just provided the distress-

198
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,168
Copybat, copybat-

199
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:27,666
Suffering from propulsion envy, Batboy?

200
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:37,008
Think of it as a welcome wagon, Bats...

201
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:41,350
welcoming you to the nearest mortuary-

202
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,349
