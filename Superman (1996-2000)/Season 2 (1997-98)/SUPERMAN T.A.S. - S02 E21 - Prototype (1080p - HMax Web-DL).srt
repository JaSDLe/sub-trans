1
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:10,995
The Lexcorp police battlesuit is the last word in law enforcement.

2
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:14,065
Once Metropolis City Council approves the prototype...

3
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:17,397
we're prepared to build enough suits to create a police force...

4
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,564
where each individual officer is as efficient as Superman.

5
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,006
Trying to put the Man of Steel out of business, Lex?

6
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:28,906
I would think, Ms. Lane, that with your knack for getting into trouble...

7
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:31,676
you'd appreciate a few extra rescuers.

8
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,848
- Touché. - Whose side are you on?

9
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:39,856
Now I'd like to introduce you to our test pilot...

10
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:45,555
the S.C.U.'s most decorated officer, Sergeant Corey Mills.

11
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:05,477
Gentlemen, ladies, prepare to be amazed.

12
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:10,612
The Series Alpha police battlesuit is a totally self-contained fighting machine.

13
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,190
In addition to being virtually invulnerable...

14
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:16,022
it sports a powerful cache of weapons...

15
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,994
including black-light lasers.

16
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,567
An impact grenade launcher.

17
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:42,053
Jetpacks for flight.

18
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,323
Infrared scopes for night vision.

19
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,935
Lex, this is a mistake. It's too soon.

20
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:00,334
There is a time and a place for dissension, Mr. Irons...

21
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:03,374
bUt never with me.

22
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,681
And the agility and strength of 20 men.

23
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,627
- What is it? - Five-alarm fire at Cooper Towers.

24
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,355
There's civilians on the roof.

25
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:29,295
An excellent opportunity to test the prototype in action.

26
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,866
Fighting fires is hardly in the S.C.U.'s jurisdiction.

27
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,940
But saving lives is.

28
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:39,408
- All right, Mills. - I'm on my way.

29
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:41,137
What's going on?

30
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,113
Hey, Smallville, how far is your car?

31
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,483
Right around the corner, toots. We going to your place or mine?

32
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,306
Guess we're working together on this one, huh?

33
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,882
Happy to have an extra hand.

34
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,249
What's going on here?

35
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,086
Superman!

36
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:12,833
- I'll start with the ones on the right. - No time. That roof is gonna collapse.

37
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,107
You're right. The suit's feeding me options.

38
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,775
- Look up there! - What are they waiting for?

39
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,011
Superman!

40
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:31,624
Move in tight and lie down.

41
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,301
I'll smother the fire!

42
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,574
Where's Mills?

43
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,676
- Do you see him? - Look!

44
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:46,994
Nice job.

45
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,730
- Impressive handshake. - I was hoping you'd notice.

46
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,476
Honey, you were wonderful.

47
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,571
Looks like he's got them in the palm of his hand.

48
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:05,775
They'd better be careful he doesn't make a fist.

49
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:17,258
But, Lex, this goes way beyond biofeedback.

50
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,422
This man's entire nervous system is integrated into the suit.

51
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,932
We've got to consider the psychological effects...

52
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,364
the aggression factor.

53
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:28,268
If there are problems, we'll deal with them as they arise.

54
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,272
That's not how I operate.

55
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:34,209
Oh, yes, it is. You work for me, remember?

56
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:36,879
Not anymore.

57
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:53,218
<i>We have more dramatic film today of Sergeant Corey Mills...</i>

58
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,258
<i>the man in the police battlesuit, foiling yet another bank robbery.</i>

59
00:07:57,426 --> 00:08:00,123
<i>We caution parents that the footage you're about to see...</i>

60
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,527
<i>may be too intense for younger viewers.</i>

61
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:07,227
<i>This is what the bank cameras caught on tape earlier this afternoon.</i>

62
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:17,707
My Lord. Corey, you're on TV again.

63
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,543
Yeah? How does it feel to have a famous husband?

64
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,649
You're so strong in that suit.

65
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,483
Don't you think you should be more careful? Not so violent?

66
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,984
Look, I'm doing a great job for this city. Why can't you just appreciate that?

67
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,427
I know, but...

68
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,261
It's better for the suit. Makes the contact points static-free.

69
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:42,396
That's just great. You could've at least prepared me.

70
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,768
What do you want? It's my job.

71
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,877
- What's that? - Brochures, for our vacation.

72
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:53,705
Forget it. I can't go now, not when I'm getting used to the suit.

73
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,283
This is becoming an obsession.

74
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:59,052
You don't understand, Trish. You don't know how it feels.

75
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:03,454
The rush, the power. It's so perfect.

76
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,790
And every day we get stronger and stronger.

77
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,232
"We," Corey? "We"?

78
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,629
You talk as if that thing were a person.

79
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,899
Oh, God, what's happening to you?

80
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,474
Nothing, baby. Nothing, it's just the excitement of it, that's all.

81
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,501
Really.

82
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:30,880
Corey?

83
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,505
Where'd you pick up that one?

84
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,149
Royal and Park. Business is good, huh?

85
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,815
Business is closed.

86
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,158
Who is this guy?

87
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,697
I was hoping you'd do that.

88
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,374
Look out!

89
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:39,546
- He's crazy! - Come on, man, out of here. Let's do it.

90
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,832
Come on, Pauly. Get it in gear!

91
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,887
Another junkyard rat.

92
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,071
- Help. - Help us.

93
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,607
- Somebody. Please. - Get this thing off me.

94
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,972
Come on, over here!

95
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:41,006
Superman. That robot guy, he's gone nuts.

96
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,251
I give up. We all give up.

97
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,185
You don't say.

98
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:03,704
What do you think you're doing?

99
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,442
Mills!

100
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,207
He's interfering with police business, inspector.

101
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:17,619
Yeah, well, maybe you better explain this police business right now.

102
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,427
<i>Sergeant Mills remains on medical leave pending an investigation.</i>

103
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:27,461
<i>Until then, the suit will be off-limits to all personnel.</i>

104
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:32,331
No. The sUit is mine!

105
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,903
We belong together. They can't just take it away from me!

106
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,435
Corey!

107
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,937
They can't.

108
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,323
Gin.

109
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,128
The sUit.

110
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,200
I warned Luthor this might happen.

111
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:19,006
Mills isn't wearing the suit, he's become the suit.

112
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,979
Taking it away from him is like removing an arm.

113
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,379
He'll never give it up.

114
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:24,780
Does it have a kill switch?

115
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,513
There's a jamming device. Attach it to the sUit...

116
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:31,148
and it'll scramble the neural connections, paralyze him.

117
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,488
- Where's the device? - Where else?

118
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:34,890
Luthor's pocket.

119
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,336
- Hey, hold it. - You can't go in there.

120
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:50,679
Something I can do for you, Sergeant Mills?

121
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,947
- They're after me. - Who?

122
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:56,710
Who? Superman, the S.C.U., everybody.

123
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:59,115
They want the suit, but they can't have it.

124
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,347
I need it. I have a purpose.

125
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,687
Of course you do.

126
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:08,789
If you remember, I created that purpose.

127
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,296
Then you can explain it to them. You can make them understand.

128
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,599
Of course I can.

129
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,036
We'll go see them together and straighten this all out.

130
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,540
There's no problem I can't solve.

131
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:47,190
See? Problem solved.

132
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,495
Get me security.

133
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:52,497
Yes, there's some garbage that needs to be...

134
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,739
- disposed of. - It's been recycled.

135
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:01,840
I thought we were allies. I thought you were my friend.

136
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:07,346
We are. I am. I was just... Liar.

137
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:39,413
You're just like all the other scum in this town, Luthor.

138
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,215
Always picking on the little guy.

139
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:44,583
How does it feel to be on the receiving end?

140
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,089
I'm not done with you!

141
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:53,982
Air ball!

142
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:47,240
You should have stayed away, Superman.

143
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:52,570
The suit and I grow stronger by the second.

144
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,342
Not even you can stop us.

145
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:58,145
You'll never take it away. Never!

146
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,964
He's still in withdrawal from the suit.

147
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:24,833
The doctor said it'll take a while, but he should recover completely.

148
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,067
The suit seemed like such a good idea.

149
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:31,906
It still is, if someone could find a way to make it work safely.

150
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,344
It'd be nice to have a little help for a change.

151
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,046
