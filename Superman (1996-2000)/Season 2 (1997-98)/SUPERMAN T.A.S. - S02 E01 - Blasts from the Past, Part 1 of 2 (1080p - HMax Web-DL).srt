1
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,436
Need a hand, professor?

2
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:31,845
No, thank you. I think I'd like to beat this one myself.

3
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:37,187
There seems to be a compartment in here that I hadn't noticed before.

4
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,338
I think you'll find this very interesting.

5
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:07,280
The Phantom Zone. Believe it or not, we're looking through to another dimension.

6
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:11,384
- Incredible. - I saw this in Brainiac's orb.

7
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,716
On Krypton, this is where they imprison dangerous aliens.

8
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:18,790
Amazing. I do wish the image were clearer.

9
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:30,403
Oh, dear.

10
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:34,775
Stay behind me, professor.

11
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:55,995
Oh, no, you don't.

12
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:05,166
- What is that? - Look out!

13
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:22,885
Hurry, professor.

14
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,791
Whatever you turned last time, turn it the other way.

15
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,644
- You okay? - Yes.

16
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:50,384
Just making a mental note to label that knob.

17
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:54,548
<i>Help me! Please! Release me!</i>

18
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:58,887
I've served my sentence. Where is the council?

19
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,590
- Hello. - Have you come to release me?

20
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,929
<i>- Who are you?</i> - Mala.

21
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,229
- Where is the council? - The council isn't here.

22
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,204
- My name is Kal-El. - Kal-El?

23
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,176
Please, bring Jor-El. He will know.

24
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:18,748
- Jor-El? Wasn't that your father? - Yes.

25
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,943
Help, please.

26
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:45,201
Hey, fellas. Keeping warm?

27
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,463
<i>Welcome to Krypton.</i>

28
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:16,232
- Tell me about Mala. <i>- One moment, please.</i>

29
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:24,479
<i>Mala, at the peak of her career, was second-in-command of Planetary Defenses...</i>

30
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:28,312
<i>answering only to the high general himself, Jax-Ur.</i>

31
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:32,650
And when our defenses have been diminished to a pitiful strike force...

32
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,156
who will save Krypton from its enemies?

33
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:43,160
<i>Jax-Ur and Mala, brilliant warriors each, stood together in service...</i>

34
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:49,274
<i>to the council for years, till the thirst for power corrupted Jax-Ur's mind.</i>

35
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,466
The council has grown weak.

36
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:56,444
Krypton needs a strong leader to reclaim its former greatness, and I am that leader.

37
00:05:56,614 --> 00:06:02,178
Together, we will usher in a new age of strength and order for all.

38
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,217
Don't move.

39
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:48,395
<i>Jax-Ur and Mala seized the ruling council, and would surely have held on to power...</i>

40
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:53,367
<i>if not for one young scientist who had learned of the traitors' plans.</i>

41
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:57,739
<i>- Jor-El.</i> - Father.

42
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:18,292
<i>At their trial, Jax-Ur defiantly claimed sole responsibility for the insurrection...</i>

43
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:22,763
<i>and was exiled permanently to the Phantom Zone.</i>

44
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,237
Where is Jor-El? Does he not have the backbone to face his condemned?

45
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:32,968
Bring me Jor-El. Let me spit at him with my final breath.

46
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,770
<i>But the council was sympathetic to Mala...</i>

47
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:38,643
<i>who they believed was only following orders...</i>

48
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:44,278
<i>and her sentence in the Phantom Zone was reduced to 20 years.</i>

49
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,509
Professor, I know it's risky, but it's the right thing to do.

50
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,407
Get the Phantom Zone projector.

51
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,680
We're letting her out.

52
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,646
Where am I? Who are you? Start talking.

53
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:55,783
I'm Kal-El, the one you spoke to.

54
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,477
- You're on a planet called Earth. - Why? Why aren't we on Krypton?

55
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,385
I'm sorry. Krypton was destroyed a long time ago.

56
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:07,386
You and I are its only survivors.

57
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:11,528
- No. - This is a lot to absorb.

58
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,533
I should take her somewhere safe until she gets her bearings.

59
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:17,103
There's no one at the STAR Labs retreat...

60
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:21,002
- if you'd like to use it. - Thanks, professor. Now, hang on.

61
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:32,379
- People on Earth can fly? - Actually, just me.

62
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,682
And you too, once your body absorbs enough yellow sunlight.

63
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:37,924
Tell me more.

64
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:41,119
And we're the only two people with these powers on the planet?

65
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,984
And you, you're defenseless against us?

66
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,159
Yes. I'm just a human being. In fact, I bleed more easily than many.

67
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,526
Please, put me down now.

68
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:58,837
Marvelous.

69
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:02,602
But you have to understand, there's a condition on your staying here.

70
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:05,575
You can't ever use your powers to hurt people.

71
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:09,950
Of course. I'll always respect...

72
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:11,642
your benevolent ways.

73
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,811
You promise?

74
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,483
Wholeheartedly.

75
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:16,919
Well...

76
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,992
I guess we're ready to try a night on the town.

77
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:43,211
Right there. Just look through the wall.

78
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,014
I see them. They're like insects raiding a nest.

79
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,722
Here we go.

80
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,333
Where are the other two?

81
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:15,945
You go after those two. I'm gonna stop that chase before people start shooting.

82
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:33,024
- Slick move, chief. You're the man. - I told you, always have a back door.

83
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,828
What the heck?

84
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,705
You wanna get out of the way, sweetie.

85
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,370
Hey!

86
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:51,850
Guess who's next.

87
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,761
You wanna return what you stole.

88
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:14,066
Yeah, yeah. Just put me down, please.

89
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:18,144
- Beg me. - I'm begging you. Please.

90
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,171
Mala, put him down.

91
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:29,180
This one's confessed, and promised restitution.

92
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,791
But, Mala, you can't...

93
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,274
Did Superman do this?

94
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,209
What's with the woman?

95
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:54,640
- Are these Earth troops? - Sort of.

96
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,546
I am Mala, Superman's second-in-command.

97
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:01,715
I offer you my promise to this world...

98
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:07,885
that I will follow in Superman's tradition of just rule with a fair hand.

99
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:12,131
And I thought I was career-minded.

100
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:27,137
<i>Mala-mania has even hit Metropolis mogul Lex Luthor...</i>

101
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:30,433
<i>who had this to say about the ex-con from Krypton:</i>

102
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,835
<i>Now the truth comes out.</i>

103
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,503
<i>Superman and this woman fancy themselves our rulers.</i>

104
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,844
<i>No doubt they plan to populate the earth with Kryptonians...</i>

105
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,680
<i>reducing us to slaves or pets.</i>

106
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:46,120
An enticing notion.

107
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,551
<i>If Superman really cares about the human race...</i>

108
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,853
<i>he should send her back to where he found her...</i>

109
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,199
<i>to that Phantom Zone dimension.</i>

110
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,196
I'm never going back!

111
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,533
Never!

112
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:19,589
I think I may have made a mistake.

113
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:23,922
The images I saw didn't say anything about her being so power-hungry.

114
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:27,861
The fact is, I wonder if even Brainiac knew the whole truth about Mala.

115
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:31,525
Might there be a way she could repair the damage she's done?

116
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:34,763
Maybe. I think it's time she spoke to the press.

117
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:36,941
Have the projector ready.

118
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:40,407
If Mala doesn't straighten out, we may have to send her back.

119
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,392
I misunderstood Superman's role on Earth. I...

120
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:02,556
I don't want to rule your planet. I only want to help people...

121
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:05,134
as Superman himself has sworn to do.

122
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,600
Yeah, right. And I'm Wonder Woman.

123
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:11,309
- Excuse me? - Nothing. So tell me...

124
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,703
are you guys an item?

125
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:15,244
- No. - Yes.

126
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,506
It's not like that.

127
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:20,079
What?

128
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,651
You'd spurn me?

129
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:24,687
The last woman of your own kind?

130
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,416
Oh, I see.

131
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:31,653
You prefer the touch of these inferior creatures.

132
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:34,298
Hey, who you calling infer...?

133
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:37,401
You've seen your last yellow sunrise, woman.

134
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,093
Mala.

135
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:53,807
I will not go back. I'll destroy every being on this planet first!

136
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,314
You okay?

137
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,818
Talk about high-maintenance.

138
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,058
I think I found your weakness. You care about that twig.

139
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:14,330
I care about everyone, though you're pushing it right now.

140
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,434
If Jax-Ur were in your place...

141
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:20,840
- the planet would be ours by now. - I'm not Jax-Ur.

142
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:26,910
No, you aren't.

143
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,642
Professor.

144
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,381
Mala... I tried to stop her.

145
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,020
She took the projector.

146
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:09,752
Welcome to Earth, my darling.

147
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,186
Believe me, you're going to love it here.

148
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:50,084
