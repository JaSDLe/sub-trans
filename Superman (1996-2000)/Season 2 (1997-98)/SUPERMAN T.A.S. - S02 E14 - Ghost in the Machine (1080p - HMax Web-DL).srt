1
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:22,708
I wonder what new toy Luthor's showing off for the brass today.

2
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:26,244
Whatever it is, I'm sure it's gonna wind up on all their Christmas lists.

3
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:38,751
I don't need to tell you what this day means to me, my dear.

4
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,155
You do have everything in place?

5
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,524
Of course, Lex. You don't think I'd let you go out there half-cocked.

6
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:46,932
What would you do without me?

7
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,864
Let's hope it never comes to that.

8
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,289
Ladies, gentlemen. Thank you for joining me...

9
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:13,289
on this beautiful spring morning.

10
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:18,428
As I speak, two Sidewinder missiles are being fired toward this very building.

11
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:20,760
- Are you crazy? - What do you think you're doing?

12
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:22,095
You can't be serious.

13
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,134
He's gotta have something up his sleeve.

14
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:25,564
I hope so.

15
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:27,434
Quiet, please.

16
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,941
The missiles will never make it here, thanks to...

17
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,908
this.

18
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,275
The LexCorp Sky Sentry.

19
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,440
Its high energy magnetic beam is designed...

20
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:40,451
to knock out the guidance system of any incoming missile.

21
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:01,304
Activate.

22
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,240
I said, activate!

23
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:08,676
It's not responding, sir.

24
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,840
The field setting's been reprogrammed.

25
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:12,041
That's impossible!

26
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,618
Get it off-line and store it in Sector Six.

27
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,319
Hey, Lex. What went wrong?

28
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,121
Premature product launch?

29
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,729
- Yeah, we want some answers! - How about it?

30
00:03:58,464 --> 00:03:59,693
Show's over, boys.

31
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,401
Those jackals are going to crucify me!

32
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,871
- But it wasn't your fault. - I know that!

33
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,409
The question is, whose fault was it?

34
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,705
- I'll get on it right away. - No!

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,841
I'd prefer to investigate this matter firsthand and alone.

36
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,852
- Sabotage? - Has to be.

37
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:26,959
Luthor's too careful to foul up like that.

38
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:28,890
But who'd want to destroy Luthor?

39
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:35,494
Well, yeah, but who'd be crazy enough to try?

40
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:44,906
Luthor.

41
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:49,743
<i>This morning's incident was not simple equipment failure.</i>

42
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,852
- Who is this? <i>- If you want more answers...</i>

43
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,285
<i>go to the research and development lab in Sector Six.</i>

44
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:58,357
Computer, trace the last call.

45
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:03,090
<i>Trace blocked. Origin unknown.</i>

46
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,201
<i>Lex Luthor, cleared for entry.</i>

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,010
Who's there?

48
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:39,760
<i>So we meet again, Lex Luthor.</i>

49
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,458
Brainiac!

50
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,195
<i>In the flesh, so to speak.</i>

51
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:50,309
<i>I managed to survive your betrayal by downloading into these computers.</i>

52
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,638
They control the Sky Sentry.

53
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,442
<i>Yes. I needed a way of attracting your attention.</i>

54
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:58,482
There's always e-mail.

55
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,416
<i>Actually, I wanted to greet you in person.</i>

56
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:05,524
<i>But as you can see, I'm not myself yet.</i>

57
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:08,088
<i>So far, I've used these drones.</i>

58
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:11,129
<i>But they're far too primitive to finish the job.</i>

59
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:15,491
<i>For that, I need your hands and your brilliance.</i>

60
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:25,670
You flatter me, Brainiac, but I already have a day job.

61
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,710
I'm the head of the world's largest multi-national corporation!

62
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,320
Don't you think someone will notice I'm missing?

63
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,917
<i>No one's irreplaceable.</i>

64
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:49,463
<i>Ms. Graves, I'm still pursuing my investigation.</i>

65
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:52,469
<i>Cancel my appointments for tomorrow and no phone calls...</i>

66
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,867
<i>until you hear from me.</i>

67
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>- Understood? - Yes, sir.</i>

68
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,577
<i>There. Shall we get to work?</i>

69
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,875
<i>Why are you stopping?</i>

70
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,304
I'm not some infernal machine. I'm human.

71
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,346
I need food and rest.

72
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:39,780
<i>There's no time for rest.</i>

73
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,444
<i>But if it's food you need...</i>

74
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,236
Hi, Clark Kent, <i>Daily Planet.</i> I need to ask Luthor a few questions.

75
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,906
Mr. Luthor is behind closed doors and doesn't want to be disturbed.

76
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,313
Is that a fact?

77
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,347
Tomorrow I'm gonna print a story...

78
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,651
suggesting possible sabotage within LexCorp.

79
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,779
I think Mr. Luthor's friends at the

80
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,263
Pentagon should find it fascinating reading.

81
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:27,087
Mr. Kent, wait!

82
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,503
- Lex, I... <i>- I said I didn't want to be disturbed.</i>

83
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,663
But there's a reporter here with questions.

84
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,968
<i>I have no time!</i>

85
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:39,841
Maybe he should make time.

86
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,106
Hey! One more step and it gets ugly.

87
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:53,453
What are you trying to pull here? Where's Luthor?

88
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:57,725
He was right here. You saw him.

89
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,968
This coffee's ice-cold. Nobody's been here for a while.

90
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,034
Well?

91
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave, Mr. Kent. Now!

92
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,281
Do yourself a favor, Ms. Graves.

93
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:25,548
Call me when your lord and master turns up.

94
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,894
Security, I want to review all building tapes from the last 24 hours.

95
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,994
It appears your little deception is starting to unravel.

96
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:41,003
<i>A minor problem, easily eliminated.</i>

97
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:47,039
Granted, Lois, Luthor does a lot of strange things.

98
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,547
But what reason could he possibly have for trying to fool his own bodyguard?

99
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,844
Maybe he just needed some space.

100
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:57,352
Haven't you ever noticed the way she hovers around him all the time?

101
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:58,956
But that's her job.

102
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:02,025
It's no wonder why you're still single, Kent.

103
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,897
Hold on, I've got another call.

104
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,664
- Hello? <i>- Is this Clark Kent?</i>

105
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,428
Speaking.

106
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,237
Hello?

107
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,508
Hello?

108
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:22,666
Sector Six. So that's where you went.

109
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,226
Have a seat, guys. I'm out of here.

110
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,972
Superman!

111
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,546
What are you doing here?

112
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,150
Someone fired a bomb into Metropolis. I followed the vapor trail.

113
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,718
Where's Luthor?

114
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,920
Come on, Mercy. Your loyalty could end up getting him killed.

115
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,169
According to the tapes, the last place he was seen was Sector Six.

116
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,677
The R&D lab. He never came out.

117
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,380
Wait here.

118
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,348
No! I'm coming with you.

119
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,187
I must admit a grudging admiration, Brainiac.

120
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,118
These microcircuits are more advanced than anything I've ever seen.

121
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,198
<i>Or will ever see again.</i>

122
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,001
You can't kill me until I finish the job.

123
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,608
And I'll rot before I help you anymore.

124
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,553
I believe I can take it from here.

125
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,976
Why are you willing to risk your life for Luthor?

126
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,277
- What does he have on you? - Nothing.

127
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,513
Before I met him, I was living on the streets like a stray dog.

128
00:15:56,688 --> 00:16:00,090
He took me in, made me what I am.

129
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,257
It's not working!

130
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,988
I think I may be able to help.

131
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,285
Lex.

132
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,034
Welcome, Kal-El.

133
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,104
Brainiac.

134
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,508
Reactivated and ready.

135
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,720
- You okay, boss? - Stop him.

136
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,329
I calculated we would meet again, Kal-El.

137
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,265
So I designed some improvements.

138
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,960
Superman, the Sky Sentry!

139
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,467
The magnetic field's going to tear the place apart!

140
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,245
Get out! Now!

141
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,745
Up there.

142
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,392
Lex!

143
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,025
Careful with that thing.

144
00:19:56,194 --> 00:20:00,723
I want the tech boys to analyze every circuit.

145
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,692
That's really a job for the military.

146
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,369
They have no claim on Brainiac.

147
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,101
Every single one of his parts is registered LexCorp property.

148
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,976
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a charity benefit to attend.

149
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,585
I'm waiting.

150
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,225
Just a stray.

151
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,762
