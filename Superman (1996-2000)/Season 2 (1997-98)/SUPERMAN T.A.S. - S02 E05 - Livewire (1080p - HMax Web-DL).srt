1
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,875
<i>Wake up, Metropolis.</i>

2
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,912
<i>Oh, yeah, the Livewire's back on attack, folks.</i>

3
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,350
<i>The queen-babe of all media, your mistress of the airwaves.</i>

4
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,547
<i>The one, the only, Leslie Willis.</i>

5
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:28,889
<i>Shouting out to you on WLXL, 95.5 Alive.</i>

6
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:31,190
<i>Okay, now, people, listen up.</i>

7
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:35,631
<i>I know you've heard this before, but you're gonna hear it again.</i>

8
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,704
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I am sick and tired of this Superman guy.</i>

9
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:44,739
<i>You hear me, Metropolis? Sick, sick, sick...</i>

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,114
<i>Of Superman.</i>

11
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:51,879
<i>I wake up this morning, and I'm in a fairly good mood.</i>

12
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:54,851
<i>But then I turn on the TV, and there he is...</i>

13
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,556
<i>on every lousy channel.</i>

14
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,389
<i>I almost puked on my corn flakes.</i>

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,021
<i>And then, big surprise, there he is again on the front page of the</i> Daily Planet.

16
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:08,064
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

17
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:11,830
<i>Am I the only one who's ill from this town's pathetic devotion...</i>

18
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,940
<i>to that phony flying boy scout?</i>

19
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,133
Amen to that, sister. I hear you.

20
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:18,505
<i>No one's that nice for free, people.</i>

21
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:22,672
<i>The Man of Steel is pulling the steel wool over your eyes.</i>

22
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,579
<i>Don't buy into that act of his.</i>

23
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,151
Just say no to Superman.

24
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,292
Looks like the natives are restless.

25
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,924
Line three, speak your tiny little mind.

26
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,997
<i>You're darn right I will, missy.</i>

27
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:42,101
<i>Because I don't appreciate your scurvy remarks about me pal Superman.</i>

28
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:46,873
Get a load of this old fogy. What's the matter, gramps, not getting enough prunes?

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,703
Now, you listen to me, smart lady. I don't think...

30
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:51,811
No, you don't think, do you, dope.

31
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:56,348
<i>This Superman is nothing more than the world's strongest con man.</i>

32
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,382
How can you just sit there while she spews that trash about Superman?

33
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:05,150
That's what shock-jocks do, Lois. Create controversy, stir things up.

34
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:08,693
If she wants controversy, wait till I interview her.

35
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,061
Hi, Mr. Kent, Ms. Lane.

36
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,496
I'm Sid Melkin, Leslie's producer.

37
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,995
- She's set for your interview now. - Now?

38
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,570
We were supposed to interview after the show.

39
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,229
Change of plans. Follow me.

40
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,171
Straight into the lion's den.

41
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:27,246
So let me ask you something, Lois.

42
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,508
I can call you Lois, can't I?

43
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:32,846
- Sure, but... - What's the deal with you and Superman?

44
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,753
What are you talking about?

45
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:39,188
Come on, you're always getting exclusives with him. How exclusive are you two?

46
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:42,423
<i>It's not like that.</i>

47
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:45,286
<i>It's not, huh? I guess we'll never know if</i>

48
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,894
<i>his p.j.'s have that big red S on them too.</i>

49
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:53,866
Hey. Hey.

50
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:59,343
Here it comes. Get out of the way!

51
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:07,220
- Come on, Lois. Just between us girls. - There's nothing to tell.

52
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:14,558
Something wrong, Mr. Kent? Am I boring you?

53
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:16,889
As a matter of fact, you are.

54
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:20,627
Don't go away mad, Clarkie.

55
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:27,806
Well, I guess some people can't handle their false idols getting knocked...

56
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:31,570
Listen, Willis, just what is your problem with Superman?

57
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:35,408
Problems, plural. First, he's never around when you need him.

58
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:14,076
Second, everything's just so darn easy for him.

59
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,667
Look.

60
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,010
My baby! My baby!

61
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:54,191
And third, all he cares about is himself.

62
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:43,369
I think that sums it up.

63
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:47,139
We're almost out of time, but remember, tonight in Centennial Park...

64
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,544
is my third anniversary celebration.

65
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,743
We're having a big blowout with guests and surprises...

66
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,581
so be there, or else.

67
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:57,781
Do you really believe that garbage you say about Superman?

68
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,858
Or is it just a way to get ratings?

69
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:03,394
Look. To make it in this town I had to be better, sharper...

70
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,930
and louder than any man to get half as much notice.

71
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,696
And nothing was handed to me on a silver platter. Unlike your friend, Superman.

72
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,965
- That's some attitude you have there. - Pays the bills.

73
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:22,280
Looks like mother nature isn't one of your faithful fans.

74
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,485
She'll come around. Everybody else does.

75
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,526
I can't believe they're not calling off this fiasco.

76
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,401
I've seen street riots more orderly than this.

77
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,042
Well, maybe reason will prevail after all.

78
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:02,988
Shut it down? With all of Metropolis watching, are you crazy?

79
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,419
But, Les, the police are saying it's too dangerous. The storm.

80
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:11,154
Sid, I worked my entire life for this moment...

81
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,096
and a little rain's not gonna stop me, you hear?

82
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:22,771
Hey, Metropolis. How's it going?

83
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,511
Hey, who are those guys?

84
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:32,652
Seems we got a little problem, people.

85
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:36,688
The authorities want to shut the party down.

86
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,419
- No. - No way.

87
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,726
We're not gonna let that happen.

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,794
- And the crowd turns ugly. - The crowd showed up ugly.

89
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,604
Are you gonna let them shut us down?

90
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:58,437
Are you gonna let them tell us what to do?

91
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,646
No.

92
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,847
No. No. We won't go.

93
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:13,993
Hey, look. The cops brought their monkey.

94
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:18,164
You have to stop this. Can't you see you're putting these people in danger?

95
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:21,324
Everybody, big blue says you should go home and sleep.

96
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,902
What do you say to that, huh?

97
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,705
See, Superman. I'm the ringmaster of this circus.

98
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,508
I tell these clowns what to do.

99
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:39,083
Not the papers and not some pumped-up freak of nature in a cape.

100
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:25,660
What happened?

101
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:29,999
Where's he taking her?

102
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,838
It was touch-and-go for a while, but the prognosis seems to be good.

103
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,172
- She'll be out of here in a few days. - What a relief.

104
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,050
I can't explain her skin discoloration.

105
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:49,881
Then again, I can't explain why she's alive either.

106
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,892
- There he is. - Superman, over here.

107
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,189
- How is she? - She's going to be okay.

108
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:01,730
How come you didn't push her out of the way?

109
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,164
- There wasn't time. - You sure of that?

110
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:08,670
- What are you getting at? - She said some awful things about you.

111
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,705
Maybe this was payback.

112
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:15,004
<i>I did everything I could to save her. Everything.</i>

113
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,938
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me.</i>

114
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:20,346
Excuse you? Look what you did to me.

115
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:24,578
If you think I made things hot for you before, just wait till I...

116
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:33,897
How the...?

117
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,421
Cool.

118
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,990
Don't come near me.

119
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:12,498
Oh, yeah.

120
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,262
This I like.

121
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,673
Sorry, kids, I can't play with you anymore.

122
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:23,246
I've got bigger fish to fry.

123
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:52,036
What's that?

124
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,611
Metropolis. My Metropolis.

125
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:59,006
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.

126
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,367
- That's enough, Ms. Willis. - It's not Ms. Willis anymore.

127
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,344
Meet her replacement.

128
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:38,846
Livewire.

129
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:41,557
Neat, huh? I ionized the air around me.

130
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,888
Pretty formfitting, don't you think?

131
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:47,455
Come back to the hospital. They might be able to help you.

132
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:51,295
What do I need help for. I'm pure energy now.

133
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:54,733
And besides, I got enough help from you the other night.

134
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:07,741
So much for Mr. Goody Two-Boots.

135
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:19,788
<i>Lights out, super-jerk.</i>

136
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:23,366
<i>Hope you're not afraid of the dark.</i>

137
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:29,464
- What's going on? - Hey, wait.

138
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,705
I can't see anything at all.

139
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:42,350
Boy, this sure brings back the old days.

140
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,251
When I was your age, we didn't have computers or fax machines or...

141
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:50,451
Yeah, yeah. And you walked 10 miles in your bare feet to work every day.

142
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:56,123
<i>Hello, Metropolis.</i>

143
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,833
<i>The tower of power is back, coming at you at about...</i>

144
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,934
<i>Oh, a gazillion megahertz.</i>

145
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:06,538
<i>Now, you may have noticed I restored some power to the city.</i>

146
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,203
<i>I've done this so that you, my adoring and helpless public...</i>

147
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,349
<i>can gaze upon</i> moi, <i>your lovely queen of all media.</i>

148
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:18,784
<i>Actually, I pretty much am the media now, seeing as I've taken complete control.</i>

149
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:22,016
<i>So don't touch that dial, Metropolis.</i>

150
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:27,826
<i>Because if you ever want your phone back, your lights...</i>

151
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,763
<i>your talk shows, your home shopping channels...</i>

152
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,732
<i>and your stupid little lives...</i>

153
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:35,065
<i>then you're gonna have to deal with me.</i>

154
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,605
Typical. Today the airwaves...

155
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,140
Tomorrow the world.

156
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,470
<i>I'm telling you, people...</i>

157
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:47,982
<i>bad things are gonna happen if you don't get with the program.</i>

158
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:52,020
It just doesn't make any sense. We've lost all radio navigation and radar.

159
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,180
All we get is that woman.

160
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,892
Look out!

161
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:14,668
<i>So start making those checks payable to me, people.</i>

162
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:18,406
<i>Because from here on, I'm the electric company, the phone company...</i>

163
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,106
<i>the cable company.</i>

164
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:24,916
<i>Don't worry, folks, I'll be back in a flash.</i>

165
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:47,938
Hey, what's going on?

166
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,506
What's the matter, guys, never seen a girl before?

167
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:06,991
Okay, time for a late power lunch.

168
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,923
Lunch is canceled.

169
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,569
It's you again. Tall, dark and stupid.

170
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:15,968
I figured you'd need to recharge yourself.

171
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:19,200
What better place than a hydroelectric plant.

172
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:32,487
Now, if you hold still, I'll drain off some of that power of yours...

173
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:35,284
until you're a bit more manageable.

174
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:47,863
<i>Sorry, blue boy. But you can't stop me any more than you can stop the rain...</i>

175
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,371
the wind or lightning.

176
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,896
Come on, baby. Come to mama.

177
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:31,305
As soon as I'm juiced, I'll finish you off, lickety-split.

178
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,360
Well, at least now we know you hit girls.

179
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:49,192
- We don't have to do this, Leslie. - I'm Livewire.

180
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:11,877
<i>I thought Willis was a menace from day one.</i>

181
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:14,540
<i>Good riddance to bad rubbish, that's what I say.</i>

182
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:19,047
<i>I wonder if Superman had anything to do with this.</i>

183
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:23,250
<i>- It's not like we can ask Leslie Willis. - I think it's sweet of Mr. Luthor...</i>

184
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:26,396
<i>to pay for her care, even if she was a maniac.</i>

185
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:32,627
<i>Honestly, I'll kind of miss her not being on the air again.</i>

186
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:35,795
<i>She really knew how to shake things up, you know?</i>

187
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,230
