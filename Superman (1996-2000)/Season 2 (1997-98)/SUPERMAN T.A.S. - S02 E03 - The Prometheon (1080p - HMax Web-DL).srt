1
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,737
<i>People, we are in a war. The stakes are high.</i>

2
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:24,568
<i>If we lose, that asteroid will hit Metropolis in a matter of hours.</i>

3
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:27,906
<i>Ten million lives will be wiped out instantly.</i>

4
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,240
And they'll be the fortunate ones.

5
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:34,010
It's up to us to destroy it as we would any other enemy...

6
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:36,085
utterly and completely.

7
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:38,449
- Any questions? - No, sir.

8
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:41,821
Still think we need the alien?

9
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:48,492
I'd feel a lot better. Can't understand how he missed liftoff.

10
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:54,571
It's no loss. The last thing this mission needs is your friend's grandstanding.

11
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,875
Sorry I'm late. Earthquake in Albania.

12
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,907
We're just glad you could make it. I'll get you the explosives.

13
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:09,651
We'll keep your team on standby.

14
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,727
There, that was easy enough.

15
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,063
I'm moving to the other side.

16
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:30,002
Just get the job done, hero.

17
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,040
<i>And no showboating.</i>

18
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,674
What do you have against him, Hardcastle?

19
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:41,410
He's an alien. He has no allegiance, no jurisdiction.

20
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:44,085
I don't trust what I can't control.

21
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:46,416
And I don't like what I can't trust.

22
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,253
<i>Emil, you'd better get over here.</i>

23
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:51,423
What's the problem?

24
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,925
You have to see this for yourself.

25
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:15,947
My heavens.

26
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:33,230
There's no doubt about it. The creature is warmer than the asteroid.

27
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,565
And listen to this.

28
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:41,471
- Heartbeats? - That's my guess.

29
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:44,240
There's also a transmitter within the rock.

30
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:47,646
It's broadcasting some kind of binary code.

31
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,653
- I'll need time to decipher it. - You'll have all the time you want...

32
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,120
after the demolition.

33
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,919
Are you crazy? That's a living thing out there.

34
00:03:56,093 --> 00:04:00,155
A living alien, and it would die when it hits the Earth's atmosphere, anyway.

35
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,358
- In good conscience, you can't... - Jeopardize the lives of millions?

36
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,264
You're absolutely right.

37
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,530
<i>Gentlemen, there may be another way.</i>

38
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:11,937
I might be able to push the asteroid into Earth's orbit.

39
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:16,944
Yes, even if it was a decaying orbit, it would buy us some time.

40
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:20,949
That's not my mission. I'm under orders to destroy that thing.

41
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:25,112
Superman, if you can alter the trajectory by five degrees...

42
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:52,705
That's it, three degrees.

43
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,215
Three point two.

44
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:08,825
What is it?

45
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:11,226
The creature's body temperature is rising.

46
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:22,103
<i>Superman, it's coming to life.</i>

47
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,875
- What are you doing? - Detonating the charges.

48
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,249
- But Superman's out there. - Wasn't his party to begin with.

49
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,180
Emil, it's falling toward Metropolis.

50
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:08,257
I'm gonna try to divert it toward the ocean.

51
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:02,903
Oh, look, a shooting star.

52
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,252
Sonic boom? Earthquake?

53
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,591
Maybe Perry had chili for lunch again.

54
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,601
Oh, my God.

55
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:21,824
I'm at 2400 fathoms, professor, about 100 miles northwest of Metropolis.

56
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,791
<i>- How's it going with that code?</i> - We're working on it.

57
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,327
Any sign of the creature?

58
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:31,161
Well, as a matter of fact, there is. And it looks like he's headed toward land.

59
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:37,470
This can't be right. It's too big to be another sub...

60
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:41,271
or even a pod of whales. Gotta be a misread.

61
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,782
Evasive maneuvers, now.

62
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,441
We're dead in the water.

63
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,613
- Reactor room, full power. <i>- A ye, aye.</i>

64
00:09:57,927 --> 00:09:59,793
<i>All right now, full speed ahead.</i>

65
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,467
- Nothing. - Keep trying.

66
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:21,214
Captain, the reactor's cooling. We're losing power.

67
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,079
It's holding.

68
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,918
<i>Superman, we need you back at STAR Labs.</i>

69
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:06,359
- I'm kind of busy right now. What's up? <i>- We've cracked the code.</i>

70
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:12,668
The code was simpler than it seemed. They wanted others to translate it.

71
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:16,000
- They? - The aliens who created that thing.

72
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:17,868
It's a synthetic being.

73
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:23,107
It was built for strength and given minimal intelligence.

74
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,805
They wanted to use it for heavy labor.

75
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,076
Obviously something went wrong.

76
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:31,949
Very. Its fuel was supposed to be the heat from their suns.

77
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:35,320
But that was hardly enough for the creature.

78
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:40,263
Soon it began to absorb heat from everything.

79
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,025
And the more it absorbed, the stronger it got.

80
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,067
No wonder it didn't burn when it fell through the atmosphere.

81
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:48,796
- The heat just made it stronger. - Exactly.

82
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:50,029
How do we stop it?

83
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,500
You know those cold packs in first-aid kits?

84
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:58,114
They work on the principle of mixing two chemicals that create instant cold. Watch.

85
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,778
- Will they work with seawater? - We're too late.

86
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,616
The creature's come ashore.

87
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:33,930
Continue firing at will. We've got him on the ropes, boys.

88
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,068
Hasn't moved since we engaged him.

89
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,568
It hasn't moved because it hasn't wanted to.

90
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,865
It soaks up the heat from the explosions.

91
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,533
- Ready the NX missiles. - Didn't you hear me? You're feeding it.

92
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:49,610
Alien, I listened to you and that crackpot Hamilton once before...

93
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:54,550
and look where that got me. This time, we're doing it my way. Fire!

94
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,520
NX gel, 10 times hotter than napalm.

95
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:08,565
We're gonna have us a down-home barbecue.

96
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,690
Better hold off on the marshmallows.

97
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:50,596
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire.

98
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,525
Yes, I can get the chemicals to the reservoir,

99
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,693
but how do we get the creature there?

100
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,855
I'll find a way. But in the meantime, I need something.

101
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:22,365
I'll see what I can do.

102
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,697
Thank you, Hamilton.

103
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:03,155
That's it, Superman. You're almost there.

104
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:25,808
No!

105
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:24,265
Now!

106
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:12,874
