1
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:21,470
Wow, this is gonna be great.

2
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,143
Superman's gonna shred that guy from Central City.

3
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:32,910
Don't bet on it, Jimmy. There's a reason this guy's called The Flash.

4
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:36,179
Oh, yeah, well if he's so swift, where is he?

5
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,783
Hey!

6
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:46,255
Sorry I'm late. Just woke up two minutes ago.

7
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,502
Give me five, big guy.

8
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,896
Too slow.

9
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,238
Flash, do you really think you stand a chance against the Man of Steel?

10
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,676
"Man of Steel." Feet of lead.

11
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:04,812
- May I quote you? - You can do more than that, doll.

12
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,451
How about an exclusive after the race?

13
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:08,915
Fast worker, eh?

14
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,421
Just watch me. I'll run circles around this superslug.

15
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,556
Save it for the race.

16
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,361
Don't worry about me, pal.

17
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:26,300
I got more than enough heat to burn your sorry...

18
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:30,905
Thank you both for participating in this charitable event.

19
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,268
The rules of the race are simple.

20
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:37,245
The first man to circle the globe 100 times will be declared...

21
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,077
the fastest man alive.

22
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:42,410
- Superman, 7-to-5. - Flash by a mile.

23
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:46,149
These electronic bands allow us to track your progress by satellite.

24
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:50,921
Swanky. But you don't need a satellite to see who's gonna win this race.

25
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,653
Shut up and run.

26
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:59,334
Gentlemen, on your marks. Get set.

27
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,330
Go!

28
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,279
Awesome.

29
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,684
Go, go, go! Yeah! Go, go, go!

30
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:42,975
<i>Madre de Dios!</i>

31
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,833
<i>As they finish their 15th lap around the world...</i>

32
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,532
<i>The Flash still holds a narrow lead.</i>

33
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,440
That's right, fools. Run your brains out.

34
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:10,693
Ben.

35
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,545
You see, Mark, it works. Just like I said it would.

36
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:26,446
The problem's always been generating enough high-velocity ionic energy.

37
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,382
But the armbands solved all that.

38
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:32,547
Now Superman and Flash are generating all the ionic energy we'll ever need.

39
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:36,387
And thanks to you, they don't even know.

40
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,425
Shut up. Get this through your thick head, little brother.

41
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,368
We don't want to call attention to ourselves

42
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,971
yet. Though the time is fast approaching.

43
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,435
Just sit back and watch the show.

44
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:05,981
Nimbus Tracking Station.

45
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,955
Batten down the hatches, general.

46
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,788
There are stormy skies ahead.

47
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:14,188
- Who is this? - You may call me The Weather Wizard.

48
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,891
And for my first trick, I suggest you watch

49
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:19,367
the skies off the coast of Northern Australia.

50
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,129
Is this some kind of joke?

51
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,005
This should get their attention.

52
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,638
Brace yourselves, mates. We're in for a squall.

53
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:59,966
That ruddy sky was just clear. Not a cloud in sight.

54
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:06,816
Bring her around, hard to port!

55
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:11,055
Hurry, man.

56
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,283
Ready to throw in the towel?

57
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,791
Haven't even caught my second wind.

58
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,473
Slow down. A ship's in trouble.

59
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,804
Yeah. Nice try, Supes.

60
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:14,380
Hey.

61
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,016
Wait for me.

62
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,184
Help! Help us!

63
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,290
Men overboard!

64
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:57,570
- Superman. - And The Flash. Hold your applause.

65
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,612
The hull split. We can't contain the oil.

66
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:29,272
Not bad. But he's still leaving a mess.

67
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,538
<i>Believe it or not, he calls himself The Weather Wizard.</i>

68
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:11,082
<i>Here's his latest message:</i>

69
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:15,114
<i>You just witnessed a small displa y of the powers at m y disposal.</i>

70
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:20,124
<i>Unless you transfer $ 1 billion into m y overseas account within the hour...</i>

71
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,759
<i>the forecast will be decidedl y gloom y.</i>

72
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,390
Hey, I know this yahoo.

73
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,932
His name's Mark Mardon. He's an extortionist.

74
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,434
Didn't he threaten to blow up the metro tunnel?

75
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:34,038
- But I put a stop to that. - But the money was never recovered.

76
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:37,606
Hey, what do you want? I ran a million miles just to find him.

77
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:41,043
No way is this guy going back in business. No way.

78
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:47,887
You coming or not?

79
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,386
Word travels fast.

80
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,955
Oh, well. They served their purpose.

81
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,455
No, you can't.

82
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:06,639
I... I mean I know that I agreed to let you use the machine first...

83
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:10,868
but it's just, well... Well, killing? Isn't that going too far?

84
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,576
Grow up.

85
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:42,432
- Unusual weather we're having. - You had to say it.

86
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:12,968
Stopped them cold.

87
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,807
Bravo. Bravo.

88
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:56,445
- But how...? - I vibrated my body till I melted through.

89
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:04,222
Hot. Now if you're ready...

90
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,262
Sometime this century?

91
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,366
How did Mardon know where we were?

92
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:20,598
Freezing us at the speed we were going would take pinpoint accuracy.

93
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,209
The armbands.

94
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:35,045
There's some sort of device in here besides the tracker.

95
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:37,747
At least your brain's faster than your feet.

96
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,804
- Sorry for the delay, general. - He's on.

97
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:55,235
<i>You have 15 minutes remaining.</i>

98
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:59,479
<i>Unless the money's in m y account in that time, I'll unleash a hurricane...</i>

99
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:02,582
<i>that will annihilate Metropolis.</i>

100
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,167
Please, Mark. I'm begging you.

101
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,568
I made this machine to help people.

102
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,241
And I paid for it to make a profit.

103
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:18,107
But threatening an entire city?

104
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,042
- I never thought that you'd... - Oh, please.

105
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,913
Don't play innocent with me. You knew my intentions.

106
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:27,817
You didn't want to believe them. The machine was too important to you.

107
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:32,193
Not that important. I won't be a party to mass murder.

108
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,759
You want out? Fine.

109
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,364
- Go. - Just like that?

110
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:43,537
Just like that.

111
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,888
Farewell, brother dear.

112
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,356
Look. What's that?

113
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:14,798
It's another weather anomaly. And it's just outside Metropolis.

114
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:44,931
Oh, no.

115
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:18,062
He's mad. He tried to kill me. He'll try to kill us all.

116
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,926
- Who? - My brother.

117
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:25,934
Oh, my God.

118
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,505
It's beginning.

119
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:35,847
Button up your overcoats.

120
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:09,016
- Where is he? - In a house just up the mountain.

121
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:12,018
Wait.

122
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,519
This must be the place.

123
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:44,518
- He's got some kind of lightning shield. - It works pretty good.

124
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,656
Take it easy. I'll try to find another way in.

125
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,081
Superman.

126
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,265
You shouldn't have come here. Your powers are nothing compared to mine.

127
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:44,268
You should've heeded the storm warning, Superman.

128
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:48,239
- There's been a change in the weather. - What?

129
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,229
No!

130
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:13,441
Help!

131
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:02,985
Mardon's gonna have to be a real wizard to get out this time.

132
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:07,060
You know, Flash, this morning I thought you were just a hyperactive jerk.

133
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,924
But you're okay.

134
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,534
Give me five.

135
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,998
Too slow.

136
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:20,706
Hey, we never did settle who's the fastest man alive.

137
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:22,634
No, we never did.

138
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:29,375
On your mark.

139
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:32,550
Get set.

140
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,486
Go!

141
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:16,294
