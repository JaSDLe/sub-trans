1
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:09,564
Hi, I'm Angela Chen.

2
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:12,554
Tonight, a new segment on <i>Metropolis Edition.</i>

3
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:15,550
"Where Are They Now?"

4
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,551
This evening, we spotlight John Corben

5
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,557
also known as Metallo.

6
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,588
Who can forget his epic battle with Superman

7
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,558
exactly one year ago?

8
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,559
This is the last known recording of the metal monster

9
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,561
who was later lost at sea.

10
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:30,560
But is he rusting on the ocean floor

11
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:32,573
or just resting?

12
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,560
Outta my way, Quantum Rider!

13
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:03,562
This is the last of your evil treachery.

14
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,555
Pow! Unh!

15
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:08,569
Aah!

16
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,588
Stupid volcano!

17
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:24,584
Can I play?

18
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,560
Go play with your dolls.

19
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,565
Fine! I'll go buy my own action figures.

20
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:35,587
On this island? I don't think so.

21
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,585
Stupid island. Stupid brother.

22
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,564
Aah!

23
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:08,576
Sarita?

24
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:20,589
It's a monster!

25
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,587
Whoa! Oh!

26
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,585
Whoa!

27
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,573
Aah!

28
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:36,587
Aah!

29
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,586
Sarita!

30
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:07,553
Are you alright?

31
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:08,588
I think so.

32
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,558
That was cool.

33
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:16,591
You saved my life.

34
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,581
Who are you?

35
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,558
I..

36
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,558
Don't know.

37
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,550
You don't know your own name?

38
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,567
Hush up, Sarita. What are you?

39
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,575
Where are you from?

40
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,564
Not sure.

41
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:44,553
He's lost. He has no place to go.

42
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,555
- Can we keep him? - I suppose.

43
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:49,552
If he doesn't belong to anybody.

44
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:50,582
He does now.

45
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,556
I'm gonna call you Tinman.

46
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,547
Tinman? Give me a break!

47
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,551
I found him.

48
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,556
Look at him.

49
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,560
He's big, he's strong like Superman.

50
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:15,570
Superman?

51
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,555
Steelman, like the man of steel.

52
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,560
That's what we'll call you.

53
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:24,584
- What do you think? - Bobby!

54
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,580
Look!

55
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,587
Oh..

56
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,549
It's gonna fall!

57
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,584
You gotta save him!

58
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,592
Oh, my gosh!

59
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:52,570
Oh..

60
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:56,554
Huh?

61
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:57,582
What?

62
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:04,588
- Steelman! - Come on. Let's go.

63
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,709
Hey, did you guys read this?

64
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:29,565
A trucker up in Raknaveek

65
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,563
says he was saved by a robot.

66
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,550
Peddle it to Angela, kid.

67
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:34,589
She covers the whackos.

68
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,565
Say, Perry, about this robot story

69
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,559
I was thinking you might wanna send somebody...

70
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,571
He is.

71
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,560
Afraid Lois beat you to it.

72
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,563
That's becoming your mantra, isn't it, Kent?

73
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,558
You think it's Metallo, too, don't you?

74
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:54,561
Let's say things could get a lot hotter

75
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:56,549
on the island of Raknaveek,

76
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,573
and I'm not talking volcanoes.

77
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,551
Hi, professor.

78
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:15,563
I'm going on a little trip and thought

79
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,584
I'd bring a change of clothes.

80
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,555
There's a juicer, a granola bar

81
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,899
a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich

82
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,582
and some grapes.

83
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,552
I told you he wouldn't eat that stuff.

84
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:34,553
Listen, Steelman,

85
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:35,571
we gotta get back to our dad

86
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,573
but we'll see you in the morning, okay?

87
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,581
Wait.

88
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:48,553
Here's something I made for you

89
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:49,563
in case you get lonely.

90
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:50,568
Sarita.

91
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:52,578
I'm coming.

92
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,583
Superman!

93
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:20,552
I'll be at the observation site all day

94
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:21,562
so don't wander too far.

95
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,565
If the volcano should erupt...

96
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,558
Yeah, yeah, we know. Come right home.

97
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:27,558
Now, listen to me, the pressure's building

98
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:28,559
faster than we thought.

99
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,562
We could be evacuating any time.

100
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:31,594
But..

101
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:35,554
Uh..

102
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:38,582
I thought you'd be happy to get off this stupid old island.

103
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:46,591
Come on!

104
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,557
Was he wearing a costume?

105
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,595
A cape? Did he say or do anything unusual?

106
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:01,570
He pulled me out of a burning truck.

107
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,565
I'd call that unusual.

108
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:04,571
And he didn't say nothing.

109
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:07,551
He just ran off with a couple of kids.

110
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:10,584
Hey, I'm not making this up. I tell you, they were kids.

111
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,554
I've started to remember everything.

112
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,596
You see, I'm...

113
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,552
I'm from another planet.

114
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:25,560
I knew it!

115
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,553
Yes. I came here to deliver

116
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,553
an important message

117
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:30,566
to the leaders of your world

118
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,554
but there are bad people who want to stop me.

119
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:36,558
I'll need a disguise to get off the island safely.

120
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,587
The fate of the whole galaxy is at stake.

121
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,595
You can count on us, Steelman.

122
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,565
Hey, what about dad's old coat?

123
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,553
This should fit him.

124
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,576
Sarita and Bobby, right?

125
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,559
Who are you?

126
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,564
My name is Lois Lane.

127
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:03,557
I'm a newspaper reporter.

128
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,556
I'd just like to ask you a few questions.

129
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,565
- About what? - About that robot.

130
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,564
The one that saved that trucker's life a few days ago.

131
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,597
Someone said you might've been there.

132
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,570
They lied.

133
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:17,597
I'll just put that down as a "no comment."

134
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:22,570
Truth is, Superman, most of us

135
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,553
are so tied up in this project

136
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:25,573
we wouldn't notice a flying cow.

137
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:29,561
I only ask because the robot was seen not far from your...

138
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:30,569
Hold on.

139
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,559
Collins, get over here.

140
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,571
Look at that sonar gauge!

141
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,589
This can't be right. She's not due to erupt for...

142
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,586
Good Lord!

143
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,591
Aah! Aah!

144
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,587
Whoa!

145
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:10,575
- You're evacuating? - You bet.

146
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,582
That little shakeup was just a preamble.

147
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,570
Yes, you did well.

148
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,558
My pursuers will never recognize me.

149
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:27,560
- I think we met one of them. - What?

150
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:30,573
A lady. She was asking questions about you.

151
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:31,575
Aah!

152
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,558
You didn't tell her anything?

153
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:34,574
No, of course not.

154
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:36,557
You're hurting me.

155
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,555
You... did the right thing.

156
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,569
But we have to be careful.

157
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:42,587
These people can be tricky.

158
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,578
<i>Very tricky.</i>

159
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:02,573
Lois Lane.

160
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:03,599
I'd give you a kiss

161
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,578
if I still had my lips.

162
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,557
Let go of me, you walking waffle iron!

163
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:20,558
Now, now.

164
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,587
Not in front of the children.

165
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,596
The evacuation alarm!

166
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:34,566
Hold on a second.

167
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,599
Okay, hit it!

168
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,588
Thanks, Superman!

169
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,575
Bobby! Sarita! Bobby!

170
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,561
- What's wrong? - My kids.

171
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,567
They must be in the woods.

172
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:46,571
They're supposed to head back here

173
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,594
the minute they hear the alarm.

174
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:07,560
You're not going to get away with this, Corben.

175
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,575
Miss Lane, please!

176
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,568
Such cliches.

177
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:13,559
How did you ever win that Pulitzer?

178
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,571
Let's go.

179
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:17,569
We can't just leave her here. She'll die.

180
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:19,573
So what? She deserves it.

181
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:21,576
Superman wouldn't let anyone die

182
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,571
no matter how bad they were.

183
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,598
I'm not Superman.

184
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:47,590
It's him! Isn't it?

185
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,569
Nice space suit, when I'm done with you

186
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,587
you'll wish you were on the moon.

187
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,581
It won't work this time.

188
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:04,588
Hyah!

189
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,558
We have to get these kids out of here now.

190
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:26,584
Get going!

191
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:12,602
What are they doing? Why are they fighting?

192
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,585
We got our own problems, kid.

193
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:31,600
Aah!

194
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:02,567
Have a drink on me, Superman.

195
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,589
Steelman, no!

196
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,602
Don't do it, Steelman!

197
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,568
Steelman?

198
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:21,584
Steelman is dead and so are you, Superman.

199
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:25,590
No!

200
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,584
Hang on!

201
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,603
Huh? Aah!

202
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:23,569
How could Steelman do those things?

203
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:24,572
We thought he was good.

204
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,570
He was, while he was with you.

205
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:27,577
Whatever goodness he had, though

206
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,583
got buried along with the rest of him.

207
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:00,593
<i>It's so still and dark.</i>

208
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:02,574
<i>No sound.</i>

209
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:04,587
<i>No light.</i>

210
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:06,565
<i>Nothing.</i>

211
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:07,580
<i>My mind..</i>

212
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:10,568
<i>I cannot let it drift.</i>

213
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,581
<i>I must remember.</i>

214
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:17,591
<i>I am Metallo..</i>
