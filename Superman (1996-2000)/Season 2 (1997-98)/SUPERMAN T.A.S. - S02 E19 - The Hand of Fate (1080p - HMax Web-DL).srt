1
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,601
This? Nah.

2
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:26,613
Pretty.

3
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,981
"I am power beyond your dreams...

4
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,311
call to me."

5
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:15,125
Yeah, right. Singing "Polly Wolly Doodle" all day.

6
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,997
Who's there?

7
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:27,967
Control, we have an intruder in building three.

8
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,745
Hey, buddy, watch where you're...

9
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:46,324
- Please, help me. - Get away from us.

10
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,098
- Hey! - Watch it. Oh, my...!

11
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,327
Man, what happened to him?

12
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:59,166
Hey, fella, you seem to be causing quite a disturbance.

13
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,002
What's going on? Who are you?

14
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,643
I...

15
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:05,873
am...

16
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,440
Karkull!

17
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,519
Free again.

18
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,125
And forever!

19
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:26,360
- What's going on? - I don't know.

20
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,449
Freeze!

21
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:56,724
What...?

22
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,380
Who are you? What do you want?

23
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:21,383
Stay out of this, mortal.

24
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,124
Still here?

25
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:46,538
But when I showed Perry the photos, he said they just weren't "front page."

26
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,577
What do I need a picture of?

27
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:56,245
- Luthor kissing a donkey? - I got something even better.

28
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:00,787
You're strong, for a mortal.

29
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,419
But a mortal is all you are.

30
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:14,869
You don't have the tools to defeat me.

31
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:10,396
I, Karkull, claim the protection of the Lords of Chaos...

32
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:13,192
for myself and my own.

33
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,590
There's your page one, Jimmy.

34
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:45,124
If we live to see it.

35
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,134
Fire!

36
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,753
Cut it. Our luck's no better than yours. What do you think it is?

37
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,927
Some kind of alien force field?

38
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,927
- I wish I... - It's an incantor.

39
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,503
You know, like a spell of protection. It's pretty awesome.

40
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,973
Hey. Behind the line, girlie.

41
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,011
Wait. Who are you?

42
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,173
My real name's Doris, but my elf friends call me Rainsong.

43
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,683
Okay, Tink, back to Neverland.

44
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,948
That thing inside calls himself Karkull. Ever heard of him?

45
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,022
I read about him in this book we sell down at my store, The Dancing Hobbit.

46
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,460
It's that little place next to the Coffee Hut.

47
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,256
- What did the book say? - About Karkull?

48
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,369
Oh, he's bad. The worst.

49
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:53,337
Seventh level lord of the inner pit. Seeks to transform all human life...

50
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,475
into his bestial demon slaves.

51
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,870
So how are we supposed to deal with that?

52
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,512
Well, if you give me a couple of hours...

53
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,240
maybe I could get my white Wicca coven together and...

54
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,386
Never mind. I know someone who can help.

55
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,939
Fate!

56
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,967
Superman.

57
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,175
- Inza, I have to see your husband. - You've been hurt.

58
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,715
Come.

59
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,743
I don't suppose you can sew too.

60
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,755
Entry level spells. Wouldn't be much use against whatever gave you that.

61
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,585
It was something called Karkull.

62
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,320
- That's why you wanted to see Fate? - Is he here?

63
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,893
Right behind you.

64
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,994
Same old Dr. Fate.

65
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,336
- You heard? - Yes.

66
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,733
Then what are we waiting for?

67
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:37,035
Not this time, my friend. I've quit.

68
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,677
What do you mean? We need you.

69
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,782
This thing has magic only you...

70
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,477
I know all about Karkull. I fought him a century ago.

71
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,649
Thought I'd won. But if there's anything I've learned from a lifetime of combat...

72
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,986
it's that victory is an illusion.

73
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,786
No matter how thoroughly you exterminate the evil...

74
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,127
it creeps back like a cockroach.

75
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,766
Well, it's time to step on him again.

76
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,503
Not for me.

77
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,767
I've removed myself from the battlefield.

78
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,188
This is my domain now.

79
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,823
The metaphysical realm.

80
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,627
I've moved beyond good and evil.

81
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,967
But there are people trapped.

82
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,198
I'm sorry. I truly am.

83
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,709
Superman.

84
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:54,146
You and I are alike, you know. We're masters of our destiny.

85
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,449
Don't waste your life in endless battle as I did.

86
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,559
Not when the universe beckons.

87
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,254
You're wrong, Fate. We're nothing alike.

88
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:16,105
Superman, my own powers would be useless against Karkull.

89
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,074
But this talisman might help you.

90
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,912
Thank you.

91
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,559
You've just sent him to his grave.

92
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,558
What do you care?

93
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,960
We've searched everywhere, even the vents.

94
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,898
There's no way out. Is he still at it?

95
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,362
Like the guest that won't go home.

96
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,925
- Holy...! - Bad choice of words, Jimmy.

97
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,070
What gives? Where's your pal?

98
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,976
He's not coming. However, I have this.

99
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,514
What's that supposed to do?

100
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,351
We'll all find out together.

101
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,660
It's opening.

102
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,429
Come on!

103
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,267
- Great! - Hey, mister.

104
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,708
We're ready. Where do you want us to chant?

105
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,312
Oy.

106
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,605
Jimmy!

107
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,991
I don't remember inviting you.

108
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,498
Kill him!

109
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,703
Careful now, it could be someone you know.

110
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:26,349
You continue to surprise me, but as I said...

111
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,454
you don't have the tools to defeat me.

112
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,522
<i>But I do.</i>

113
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,668
Fate, I thought our dealings had come to an end long ago.

114
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,741
No such luck, I'm afraid.

115
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:55,347
What magic do you have that's powerful enough to defeat me in my own lair?

116
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,511
The artifact of Lorta. I destroyed it!

117
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,251
What has been made can never be unmade.

118
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,964
No!

119
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,377
The artifact! It's the only power that can trap him. Get it!

120
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,777
- But you... - Go!

121
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:36,711
Fate!

122
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,319
Don't let go!

123
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,201
Did we miss something?

124
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,110
It's okay.

125
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,215
Hold on.

126
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,463
The healing balm should do its work.

127
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,731
- What made you change your mind? - You.

128
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,004
- Something I said? - Something you did.

129
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,401
You went back.

130
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,470
You didn't stand a chance, but you went back.

131
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:15,744
Till then, I thought it was only the forces of evil that wouldn't give up.

132
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,406
I was wrong.

133
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,046
Your helmet.

134
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,155
I'll be needing it.

135
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,651
