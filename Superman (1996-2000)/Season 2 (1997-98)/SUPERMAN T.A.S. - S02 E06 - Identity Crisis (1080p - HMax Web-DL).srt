1
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,982
Aah! Mmh.

2
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:11,992
- Hang on, Tommy! - Just climb down!

3
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:15,004
I'm scared! I can't move.

4
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:19,983
- What if he dies? - I'm not telling his mom.

5
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,977
- Look! It's Superman! - Tommy! Superman's coming!

6
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,999
- He's gonna help! - It's okay now. I've got you.

7
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,972
Alright. Who wants to explain what you were doing up there?

8
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,974
- They dared me. - We didn't think you'd do it!

9
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,979
I know it's tough to turn down a dare

10
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:43,969
but sometimes being brave means using your head

11
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:44,981
and not doing something dangerous

12
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,972
just 'cause other kids pressure you.

13
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,975
You're right, Superman. I'll be smarter next time.

14
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah. Thanks, Superman.

15
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,994
Okay, then. Bye-bye.

16
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,003
- What a dork! - Is not!

17
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,960
Of course he is, with that corny little speech.

18
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:05,973
- I mean, come on! - Little whiner!

19
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:06,999
Shut up!

20
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:11,986
- Hey, Superman! - We love ya, big guy!

21
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:03,968
Get your hands up!

22
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:13,952
Aah!

23
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,964
- Take a wrong step, Mr. Kent? - What?

24
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,933
- Clark! - Uh, thanks ...perman.

25
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,934
Maybe you two should leave the dirty work

26
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,943
to the authorities, hmm?

27
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,929
- Uh, I.. - Yeah, right.

28
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,956
Have you ever known me to play it safe?

29
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:37,938
I suppose not.

30
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:39,934
We should have a word about that.

31
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,926
Maybe over dinner?

32
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,930
Um, fine with me. 8 o'clock?

33
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,921
Meet you on the roof of The Planet.

34
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:47,947
It's a date.

35
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:52,924
A date? Hmm! Must be this new perfume.

36
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,957
Hey, Smallville! You alright?

37
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:56,931
Uh, yeah.

38
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:58,926
A little shaken up, I guess.

39
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,928
You go on ahead, Lois. I feel like walking it off.

40
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,952
Are you nuts? We're miles from nowhere.

41
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,906
- What about the story? - You know us country bumpkins.

42
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,916
10 miles to school and all that.

43
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,932
Your loss. My byline.

44
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,941
- Ooh!

45
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,936
Thanks, Superman. We're okay from here.

46
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,933
Excuse me.

47
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,893
I know you're a busy guy, but I am dying

48
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,920
to get your autograph.

49
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:03,890
Okay. Who are you? What's the game?

50
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,893
There's no point keeping up the act with me.

51
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,897
The question is who are you?

52
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:11,900
Let me guess. This is all a distraction to keep me busy.

53
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:14,886
If you say so, but I should warn you

54
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,881
your makeup's rubbing off.

55
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,921
This.. This is a trick.

56
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,905
How are you doing this? Answer me!

57
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:41,914
Oomph!

58
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,889
Whoever you are, you don't look so good.

59
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,898
Leave me alone!

60
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:34,853
I... have... problem.

61
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:38,871
My friend, I would call that an understatement.

62
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:49,844
But... he looked like me.

63
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,841
I no understand.

64
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:56,844
It's alright. Calm down.

65
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:59,852
How? How could he?

66
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:03,841
I'm Superman. Me!

67
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:06,851
- Aah! Me. - What's happening to him?

68
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,845
Why isn't he following my orders?

69
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:11,847
I warned you, the alien DNA was unlike anything

70
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,849
we'd cloned before.

71
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:14,837
It must be breaking down.

72
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:17,836
I say we abort. Activate the auto-destruct.

73
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,832
Get rid of them all while we can.

74
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,839
We are not scrapping the project for one glitch.

75
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,838
Take this opportunity to learn, doctor.

76
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,833
Study him... for the sake of the others.

77
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:31,837
Come. Let's look your over.

78
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,832
What going on?

79
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:39,825
Me am Superman.

80
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,846
Yes. Yes, of course you are.

81
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:46,833
At least his programmed memories are holding.

82
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,834
Although the damage has clearly affected

83
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:49,861
some parts of his brain.

84
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,845
No kidding?

85
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,829
What am me?

86
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:04,825
Bizarro, that's what you am.

87
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,833
Mercy...

88
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:10,853
Bizzaro? That not my name.

89
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,827
If the shoe fits, handsome.

90
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,850
No! Me am Superman!

91
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:19,809
Me am hero.

92
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,834
Me show you.

93
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,820
That's coming out of your pay.

94
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:53,820
Ah! There! Me save building!

95
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:02,821
Unh!

96
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,808
Whoa!

97
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,808
Don't ask me. I just catch them.

98
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,765
Me fix bridge!

99
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:56,795
That prove me Superman!

100
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,765
What the heck is he doing?

101
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:13,784
I can't slow it in time, sir.

102
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,788
It not break again.

103
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:49,743
Nooo! You am no Superman!

104
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:53,775
Me am Superman! You leave me alone!

105
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,774
So now I'm ruining his day.

106
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:07,763
Whew!

107
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,764
I wasn't sure you'd really come.

108
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:26,766
Me remember.

109
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,733
Me need Lois help.

110
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,735
Don't be afraid.

111
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,757
Me never hurt you.

112
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:37,914
I heard about our date, Lois.

113
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,727
Problem is you made it with the wrong guy.

114
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:44,725
Imposter! Stay back, Lois!

115
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:45,763
Me protect you!

116
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,762
Unh!

117
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:04,748
Lois...

118
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:09,743
Aah! Aah!

119
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,720
Don't worry. Me save Lois.

120
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:23,723
Me always save Lois.

121
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,744
Me hero.

122
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,689
Me have memories.

123
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:13,685
Me know am Superman,

124
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,682
but other Superman make me confused.

125
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:22,712
Me come to Lois... because Lois friend.

126
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,682
Um, I had a late lunch.

127
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,704
Which I'm about to lose.

128
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:38,684
So, um, Superman. Tell me about these memories.

129
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,702
What is it you remember?

130
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,715
Girl at lab call me Bizzaro

131
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,682
but that not right. Me am Superman.

132
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:50,688
Did you say lab?

133
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:53,681
In mountain where me born.

134
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,679
Me show Lois.

135
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:58,709
Me like take Lois for ride.

136
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,693
Um, sure. Aah!

137
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:04,708
But use the door this time.

138
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,691
- Okay. - Ow!

139
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,664
This am home.

140
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,679
Cozy.

141
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:51,660
Oh, my God!

142
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:55,653
This is some kind of cloning operation.

143
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,649
Someone's making duplicates of Superman.

144
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:01,662
Not someone.. Me.

145
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,642
It was a-a freak dressed as Superman!

146
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,638
He burst in here with a woman and scared everyone away.

147
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:11,652
They just sat there for a few minutes, and-and they took off.

148
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:15,637
But that not right. Me am Superman.

149
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:19,641
- Did you say lab? - In mountain where me born.

150
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,639
What direction were they headed?

151
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,642
I trust you remember Superman's run-in

152
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,636
with a mechanical dinosaur?

153
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,649
- How could I forget? - Hmm.

154
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,636
He was so weak from the kryptonite

155
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,640
our man of steel actually bled.

156
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,672
My technicians collected a few drops from the floor

157
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,648
and from that humble beginning, we have this.

158
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,632
Your own army of supermen.

159
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:44,631
All programmed to answer to me.

160
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:49,632
A charming image, except for this... technical difficulty.

161
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:53,623
No! Them no Superman.

162
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,635
Me am Superman!

163
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,628
Me am hero!

164
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:01,640
Sorry, my friend, but you am toast.

165
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,643
Aah!

166
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,658
- Uhh! - No!

167
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,611
Since it's too late to save the others, we should clean house.

168
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:16,654
Engage the auto-destruct. Mercy, start the chopper.

169
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:22,618
There. We've got 2 minutes.

170
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:24,623
You can't just leave him like this!

171
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,606
You're welcome to stay.

172
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,629
Though I wouldn't advise it.

173
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,648
Decide quickly, Lois. The ride leaves now.

174
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,631
Grrrr! Uhh!

175
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,606
Where think you going?

176
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,601
You not get away from Superman.

177
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,641
Aah! Unh!

178
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:59,624
Aah! Uhh! Now no one leave.

179
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,605
He's destroyed the terminal!

180
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:19,625
I can't cancel the auto-destruct.

181
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:38,579
Superman! We've got to get out!

182
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:41,616
You! Me kill you!

183
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,575
She meant now, Superman!

184
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,586
We're sitting on top of a half-kiloton of explosives.

185
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,605
Enough, I presume, to destroy even you!

186
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,588
Now! Run!

187
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,565
Aah!

188
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:17,586
Uhh!

189
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:27,584
Superman!

190
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:41,585
- Unh! - Superman... save ...is?

191
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:52,574
- Unh! - My leg.

192
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,576
Me hold. You go.

193
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,544
Me no am Superman.

194
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:18,544
You am Superman.

195
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:21,576
Superman save Lois.

196
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:28,569
You are a hero.

197
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,542
- Do you think he survived? - I don't know.

198
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,530
I've never been in a half-kiloton blast.

199
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,522
I hope he did.

200
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,520
He turned out to have a good heart.

201
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:00,563
Well, naturally. He came from good stock.
