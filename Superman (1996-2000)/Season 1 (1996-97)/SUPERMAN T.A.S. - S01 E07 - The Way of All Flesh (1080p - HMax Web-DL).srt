1
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:16,291
- Ready for your dinner, Mr. Corben? - Bring it in, Ralph.

2
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,774
Perfect.

3
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:30,575
Yes?

4
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:33,315
Mr. Corben, I hope you don't mind me asking...

5
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,044
but after all these months, I just gotta know:

6
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,586
How do you rate all this?

7
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:43,754
Ralph, the trick is to never underestimate the value of a good friend.

8
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,825
And always keep your mouth shut.

9
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,659
You having those pains again?

10
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,702
It'll pass. Always does.

11
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,471
You can go.

12
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:58,905
Maybe it's all that rich food.

13
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:05,013
Mr. Corben!

14
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,382
You're out of your mind. I'm too young.

15
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:16,026
I exercise, I take supplements.

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,125
It's a virus, Mr. Corben. None of that matters.

17
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,595
There's gotta be some medicine.

18
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,290
It's a very rare disease.

19
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:28,305
We don't... There might be an alternative treatment.

20
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:30,834
What kind of treatment?

21
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,770
For now, you'll just have to trust me...

22
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,913
and a certain good friend.

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,515
Wait a minute. You know my fr...

24
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:41,880
Relax, Mr. Corben. And conserve your strength.

25
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:43,520
You'll be needing it.

26
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,425
On your right.

27
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,364
Slowpoke.

28
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,347
- What's going on? - Some kind of explosion.

29
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,955
- Did you know about this? - No, but who cares?

30
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,523
Let's get off this rock.

31
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:38,468
Some kind of parole, huh?

32
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,906
I can't steer.

33
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,022
They're all yours.

34
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,390
Mind if I borrow something?

35
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:07,238
Don't quit. We're almost there.

36
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,230
We did it, doc.

37
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,766
The smell of freedom.

38
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:43,096
Never thought I'd see the day.

39
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,831
Come on, we have to hurry.

40
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,577
No one's been more loyal to me than you, John.

41
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:52,374
You could've implicated me in the Lexo suit affair, but you didn't.

42
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,541
For that, I'm going to reward you.

43
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:57,813
This sure doesn't feel like a reward, Luthor.

44
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,820
It's the only way to save your life.

45
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,556
You have to do it.

46
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:06,288
Don't worry. You'll look exactly as you do now.

47
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,555
But I'll be metal on the inside.

48
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:10,325
Better than metal.

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,062
Metallo, a virtually indestructible alloy.

50
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:15,604
That the Kryptonite?

51
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:19,573
The source of your power and Superman's destruction.

52
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:23,007
You want that, don't you? After what he did to you?

53
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:24,679
What do I have to lose?

54
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,216
Indeed.

55
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:48,843
<i>Thanks to Superman, all but one of the inmates...</i>

56
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,615
<i>were back in their cells soon after the attack.</i>

57
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,782
<i>As yet unaccounted for is John Corben, a mercenary...</i>

58
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,451
<i>who police describe as extremely dangerous.</i>

59
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,893
<i>Several months ago, he stole a high-tech...</i>

60
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:03,466
<i>Lexo suit and battled Superman to a virtual standstill.</i>

61
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:06,114
<i>Police are investigating connections between</i>

62
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,334
<i>the missile attack and Corben's escape.</i>

63
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:11,635
I'd like to know who has access to air-to-surface missiles.

64
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,277
These days, almost anyone.

65
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:16,509
One way or another, Corben won't be free for long.

66
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,646
- How's that? - Corben's medical records.

67
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,445
I have a friend at Stryker's.

68
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,351
Orozco's retrovirus?

69
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:28,519
One hundred percent fatal.

70
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,953
But the only place it's native to is some little island off South America.

71
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,792
Kent, Corben was a mercenary...

72
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:37,730
and a fugitive from at least five countries.

73
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,064
That's a recipe for a frequent flyer if I ever heard one.

74
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:43,798
Well, how do you feel?

75
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,700
Great. Better than I have in weeks.

76
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:49,104
Shall we test out that theory?

77
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:52,812
Hit that, please.

78
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,316
Impressive.

79
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:59,548
Wasn't even trying.

80
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,621
Satisfied?

81
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,931
Now, if you'll please stand still.

82
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,001
Hey, wait a minute.

83
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:18,536
Your skin is also made from Metallo.

84
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,907
But I can't feel anything.

85
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,015
It's like I'm controlling my hands from outside my body.

86
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:28,684
Some adjustments need to be made, that's all.

87
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,047
But first, you have a job to do.

88
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,254
- Superman? - Yes.

89
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,651
I have a luncheon to attend. I expect to hear...

90
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,730
the tragic news about him just before dessert.

91
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,228
Dessert?

92
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,694
I haven't had anything to eat or drink since the operation.

93
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:47,537
I haven't wanted anything.

94
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:52,006
The only hunger you should have is for power, my friend.

95
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:54,941
The only thirst, for revenge.

96
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:06,989
Roses.

97
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,625
Would you like a rose?

98
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:11,952
No, thanks.

99
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,496
They smell wonderful, see?

100
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,229
I don't smell anything.

101
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,561
But they're very fragrant.

102
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,069
Get away.

103
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,542
He's on the tracks.

104
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,147
Get off of there, you jerk.

105
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:01,335
Last stop, everyone!

106
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:02,943
Last stop.

107
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,847
<i>Whoever he is, he appears to have strength like Superman's.</i>

108
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:13,684
<i>Bullets have no effect on him.</i>

109
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:16,387
<i>Do we have another alien in our midst</i>?

110
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:21,698
<i>The attack began minutes ago, when the man single-handedly derailed a train.</i>

111
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,027
<i>Police are still trying to identify him.</i>

112
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:25,464
Corben?

113
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,568
How did you do it, Corben?

114
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:09,009
A drug? Some kind of operation?

115
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,209
Elective surgery.

116
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,448
- Jealous? - Not likely.

117
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:15,709
You're going back to prison.

118
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:22,658
- I'm as strong as you are now. - Almost.

119
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,427
No, stronger.

120
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:32,563
What's the matter, guy? You're looking a little green at the gills.

121
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,437
I think you're jealous of me...

122
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:42,372
because now I'm the real man of steel.

123
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:02,530
That was rather desperate.

124
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,534
You humiliated me, Superman.

125
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:16,576
Took me in by the scruff of my neck like I was a kid.

126
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,916
Now it's payback time.

127
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:24,785
Get in, hurry.

128
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,888
He's not going anywhere, Ms. Lane.

129
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:33,627
Corben.

130
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:36,698
You remember me. Good.

131
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,460
I've thought about you a lot.

132
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,301
Especially these last few months in prison.

133
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,367
Corben, if you so much as...

134
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:50,643
I... I... I didn't feel anything.

135
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:52,482
See if you feel this.

136
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,854
I can't even feel a kiss.

137
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:01,849
What did they do to me?

138
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:15,202
Are you all right?

139
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:18,474
Getting there. Sorry about your car.

140
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:21,668
Yeah, the insurance company'll love this.

141
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,108
At least you got him.

142
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,373
For now.

143
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:33,050
I want those adjustments now.

144
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:34,820
What adjustments?

145
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:38,952
The ones Luthor told me about when I said I couldn't feel my hands.

146
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,529
Those adjustments.

147
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:43,495
Well, the adjustments were yours to make.

148
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,965
Mine?

149
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:47,001
You're telling me...

150
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:50,900
There'll always be a certain numbness, a lack of feeling.

151
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:54,603
- But you'll get used to it. - I don't want to get used to it.

152
00:12:56,547 --> 00:13:00,382
Mr. Corben, the operation gave you almost infinite strength.

153
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:03,416
You can never get sick. You're invulnerable to injury.

154
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,249
You'll never feel pain again.

155
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:08,219
And what about pleasure?

156
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,892
That was never part of the equation.

157
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:14,024
Find me a body. Change me back.

158
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,856
I have to feel.

159
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,193
We... We can't. The transplant is permanent.

160
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:30,943
It's all fake.

161
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,617
A fraud.

162
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,384
There's the reality.

163
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,621
The metal behind the man.

164
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,948
It's all I am now.

165
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,923
It's who I am.

166
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,190
Metallo.

167
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,185
I'm sorry, Dr. Vale resigned.

168
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:56,217
Lucky stiff came into some money. Couldn't get out of here fast enough.

169
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,820
I'll bet he didn't say where he was going.

170
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:02,122
How'd you guess? This was his office.

171
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:05,595
- You're welcome to look around. - Thanks. We shouldn't be long.

172
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,534
There's got to be a link to Corben.

173
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:12,035
And then what? It's not going to stop his next rampage.

174
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,369
I don't care how tough he is, he's got to have a weakness.

175
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,940
You talk as if it's our job to stop him, Kent.

176
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:22,240
After what I saw, I don't even think it's Superman's.

177
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:26,283
- What are these? - They call them sharp boxes.

178
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,284
They're for used needles, razors.

179
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,751
Lovely.

180
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:44,498
Well, what do you know? Parking validation.

181
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,637
Now, there's a page-one headline.

182
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,331
Kent, it's from LexCorp.

183
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:57,074
It's so big, Mr. Luthor.

184
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,810
I've never seen a yacht this size.

185
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,353
I've given the crew the day off, my dear.

186
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,419
But the ship is fully automated.

187
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,583
Shall we go for a short cruise?

188
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,592
How's the caviar, Luthor?

189
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:11,997
Rich and delicate?

190
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,932
Just melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

191
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:19,763
You like my new look? I hope you do.

192
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:23,076
Because it's the last thing you'll ever see.

193
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:25,108
Is there a problem, John?

194
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,444
I can't taste anymore.

195
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,515
I can't smell.

196
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,782
Can't... Can't...

197
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:41,993
Now it's your turn.

198
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:44,460
You didn't think I'd leave you like this?

199
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,223
I told you it was temporary.

200
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,661
Liar! The doctor can't do anything for me.

201
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:51,464
Maybe not now, but someday.

202
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:54,072
People all over the world are working on this.

203
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,733
It'll take time, but what do you care? You're practically immortal.

204
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,403
So go ahead, kill me if you want to, but what then?

205
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:06,681
You don't know how this feels. It's driving me crazy.

206
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,384
Get below.

207
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,455
I've got to get you out of here.

208
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,522
A lab off the coast can repair your skin.

209
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,531
But don't forget, you still owe me Superman.

210
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,529
Patience, Luthor.

211
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:25,429
It's something we're both going to need.

212
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,603
Maybe not.

213
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:37,240
Where's Corben, Luthor?

214
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,976
- Who? - I know about Dr. Vale.

215
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:42,520
It won't be long before the police find him.

216
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:46,352
And what makes you think there's any of him left to find?

217
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:57,570
Allow me to introduce my recreation director.

218
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,397
I'm ready for that rematch.

219
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,908
We have to talk, Corben.

220
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,410
Come closer.

221
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,912
I can't hear you.

222
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:20,088
Listen to me, Corben.

223
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,727
You're being duped.

224
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:23,590
Luthor's the one who set you up.

225
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,330
You didn't know I could focus it like that, did you?

226
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:37,106
Finish him. Now!

227
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:53,950
Some enemy.

228
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,455
Luthor's your enemy. He did this to you.

229
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:00,028
Yes, he saved me from that virus.

230
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,861
Otherwise I'd be dead by now.

231
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,101
Here's your virus.

232
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,967
- What's this? - The doctor... put it in your food.

233
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:12,875
How else do you think you got such a rare disease?

234
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:21,981
- But why would he...? - Luthor... told him to.

235
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,726
The Kryptonite's gotten to him. He's delirious.

236
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:31,393
I'm not so sure of that. I'll be right back.

237
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,025
Don't be a fool, Corben.

238
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:39,798
Don't you see? He'll turn us against each other to save his own skin.

239
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:43,238
- Who knows what's in that vial? - Then why don't we test it?

240
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,269
Corben, no.

241
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,043
No.

242
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:03,053
Come on, Luthor. Drink up.

243
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,053
It did wonders for me.

244
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:26,879
Help! Help!

245
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,452
I can't float!

246
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,053
Bon voyage.

247
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:32,219
Help. Help.

248
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,395
I can't... Help... Help...

249
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,819
You'll excuse me if I don't see you home.

250
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,989
You'll never pin this on me.

251
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:12,222
The virus is destroyed, and Corben's lost at sea.

252
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:16,494
Even if you found him, there'd still be that Kryptonite to worry about.

253
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:20,135
I don't think I'm the one who should be worrying.
