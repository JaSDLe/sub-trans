1
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,679
Come on, answer.

2
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:23,823
I told you before, I'm not coming out.

3
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:26,327
What part of that didn't you understand?

4
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,724
Earl, you've got to listen to reason.

5
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:33,461
<i>I have listened to reason. My own.</i>

6
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:37,569
- What'd he say? - We're gonna have to do it your way.

7
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,208
All right. Okay, move in.

8
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:04,366
For the love of Mike.

9
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:07,698
- He's probably got the place reinforced. - Let's find out.

10
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,540
Right flank, advance.

11
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,836
Get him to the hospital, now.

12
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:52,847
It's just a little singe, Maggie.

13
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,954
Inspector Sawyer, Professor Hamilton.

14
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:07,859
Perfect timing. The man inside's Earl Garver.

15
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,510
Used to work at STAR Labs.

16
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,025
Until he stole a radioactive isotope from us.

17
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,194
He sent this to the mayor today.

18
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,601
He says he used the isotope to make a bomb.

19
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:19,538
And he'll detonate it if we don't pay by tonight.

20
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,100
It could take out a square mile of the city.

21
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:24,044
Let's see if I can change his mind.

22
00:04:58,374 --> 00:04:59,933
Where's the bomb, Garver?

23
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:03,637
Wherever it is, it's already ticking and concealed in lead.

24
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:06,874
So the real question is, where's my money?

25
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,951
I don't play those games.

26
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:09,806
Did he say anything, doctor?

27
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,643
It's a concussion. He'll be unconscious for the next day or two.

28
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,445
The bomb goes off in four hours.

29
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,383
Even I couldn't search the city in that time.

30
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,953
If I might make a suggestion...

31
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:27,393
there's someone who might be able to tell us exactly where that bomb is.

32
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:40,477
I think I understand how you feel, Superman.

33
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:43,010
If it'd happened to me, I'd be leery too.

34
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:48,049
That's not it. What you want to do could be more dangerous than a dozen bombs.

35
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:52,345
We'll take every possible precaution.

36
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,891
But right now, he's our only hope.

37
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,859
Why should I help you? You're the one who put me here.

38
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,195
Rudy, the whole city's in trouble.

39
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,961
Tell somebody who cares.

40
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,969
The bomb could blow up a huge area of Metropolis.

41
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,407
- What if that includes Stryker's Island? - What if it does?

42
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:27,037
Think I'd miss this life of mine? These four stinking walls?

43
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:30,708
You want me to go into his mind and find out where the bomb is.

44
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,649
No skin off my nose.

45
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,154
- But I want something in return. - What's that?

46
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,850
Something to help the time go faster.

47
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,326
And not a bunch of boring books, either.

48
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:44,660
I want cable, and the premium channels.

49
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:10,284
- All set, Rudy? - You bet.

50
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,427
Get that big screen warmed up for me.

51
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,080
Something's wrong.

52
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:48,721
Rudy, can you hear me? Did you find out where the bomb is?

53
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,790
I know where it is, all right.

54
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,901
But you still have to pay.

55
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,462
- Sounds like Garver. - Rudy?

56
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,973
Sorry, Emil. I've put Rudy on the back burner.

57
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:04,510
- You're cooking with Earl now. - What's happening?

58
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,878
The Parasite has somehow taken Garver's consciousness, not just his memories.

59
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,246
- How? - Garver's intellect, his ego...

60
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,514
his force of personality. It all must have combined to...

61
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:18,182
- What's it going to be? - You're still stuck here, Garver.

62
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,191
You don't even know where you are.

63
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:25,129
If that bomb goes off, there's a good chance you'll go with it. Both of you.

64
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:31,032
Come on, what're you waiting for? They got you.

65
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,868
Cooperate and they'll treat you real good.

66
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,705
You'll never get away, Garver.

67
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,439
The best-laid plans...

68
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:58,723
He thought nobody would stumble across his bomb here.

69
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,366
There's the wreck.

70
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:17,081
Once you find the sucker, I can disarm it.

71
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,949
- See anything? - No, there's too much debris.

72
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,061
We'll have to go in.

73
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:36,026
Let's make this a short visit.

74
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:54,450
You're just wasting your time. I mean, our time.

75
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:57,217
Perhaps if we work together, Rudy.

76
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,884
You know, double the will, double the strength?

77
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,394
A partnership.

78
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:04,691
Wouldn't work. In a couple of hours...

79
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:08,325
you'll be gone. That's the way it is with the Parasite.

80
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,062
I can't keep what I take.

81
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:11,934
Don't be so short-sighted.

82
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:18,307
Suppose I could find a way for the Parasite to retain the power it takes, forever.

83
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,914
Yeah, what if pigs could fly?

84
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,483
I'm serious. I can help you.

85
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:26,211
But you have to help me too. Come on.

86
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:29,585
This could be your last chance for freedom and power.

87
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:34,161
But maybe you'd prefer your cable television?

88
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,412
That's it, Rudy.

89
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:55,105
Guard.

90
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,080
What's the matter?

91
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:04,058
I feel so weak.

92
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,859
That's better.

93
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,047
It's not here. He's playing games with us.

94
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:40,218
No, he's buying time. We'd better get back.

95
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,001
What was...?

96
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,964
They're gone.

97
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,768
Both of them.

98
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,545
- My leg. - How's that feel?

99
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,207
- It feels so strange. - Someone's got to help me.

100
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,853
I'm really hurting.

101
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,016
Twenty minutes left.

102
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,026
He'll call.

103
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:27,031
- Yes? <i>- This isn't a game of chicken anymore.</i>

104
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,160
<i>I still want the money. Fifty million in unsigned bearer bonds.</i>

105
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,272
<i>- Understand?</i> - So far.

106
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,032
<i>There's just one modification.</i>

107
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,268
<i>I want Superman to bring it to me...</i>

108
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,437
<i>- and I want him to come alone. Agreed?</i> - Agreed.

109
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,410
<i>Very good, Superman. Go to the old subway extension.</i>

110
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,215
<i>Enter by way of the north-side station. I'll be waiting.</i>

111
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,325
<i>Welcome, Superman.</i>

112
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,403
<i>If you're trying to use your x-ray vision, you'll find the rock marbled with lead.</i>

113
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,064
<i>Now, go up the tracks and follow the Y to the right.</i>

114
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,122
<i>You'll find a pit. It's the reason they stopped construction.</i>

115
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,958
<i>It's so deep, I doubt whether even you could see the bottom.</i>

116
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,430
<i>Now, if you look to your left...</i>

117
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,841
<i>you'll see an exit sign.</i>

118
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,779
<i>Deposit the bonds there, and proceed to the center of the chamber...</i>

119
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,044
<i>where you'll find my little toy.</i>

120
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,455
<i>Hit the following keys:</i>

121
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,461
<i>Three, five, nine, one, then enter.</i>

122
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,648
Did you really think I'd settle for money when I could have your power too?

123
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,027
You see, I've already gotten some of it.

124
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,191
Only a first course.

125
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,623
Time for the entrée.

126
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,209
The longer we do this, the weaker you'll get.

127
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,210
Then perhaps we should call an end to the stalemate?

128
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,582
What are you doing?

129
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,090
Two minutes. That's all you've got.

130
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,592
Now come over here and hold out your hand like a good boy.

131
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,023
Shut it off. You'll be killed too.

132
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,634
Will I? My real body is miles north of here...

133
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,270
resting peacefully in an ambulance.

134
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,601
Hear that, Rudy? He's willing to sacrifice you.

135
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,936
It'll never come to that.

136
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,704
He's already taken control of your body, Rudy.

137
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,678
What do you think he's going to do with your mind?

138
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,647
You gonna crowd me out? Is that where this is going?

139
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,550
Rudy, you're a loser without me.

140
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,783
- It's this or the cell. - Some choice.

141
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,959
What are you...?

142
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,398
Fight him, Rudy.

143
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,734
He's changed the code.

144
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,538
Rudy?

145
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,576
Cat's got his tongue.
