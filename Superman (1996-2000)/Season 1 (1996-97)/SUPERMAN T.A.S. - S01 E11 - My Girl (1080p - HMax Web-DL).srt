1
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,125
Look at that. The only thing holding...

2
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,202
- that dress up is faith. - Hey, come on.

3
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,703
- Someone's coming! - It's Lex! She's with him!

4
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:40,363
Great!

5
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,702
Lex, over here.

6
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:48,539
It's the paparazzi wolves trying to get a scent of Lex's latest lady friend.

7
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,378
Not that I read the gossip columns or anything...

8
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:55,352
but I hear they're quite an item. Maybe I should warn her about him.

9
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:59,118
- No. - Who is she?

10
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:02,262
The trendy fashion designer, L.L.

11
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:05,160
L.L.? Lana Lang?

12
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,491
- Lana! - L.L., over here!

13
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,897
Give us a smile.

14
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,096
- What a couple. - Lana, are the jewels real?

15
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:14,104
Everything is real, boys.

16
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,438
Lana.

17
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,342
Sorry, no more questions. I am here to work.

18
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,609
- What's Lana doing with Luthor? - You know her?

19
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:27,516
- We used to date. - Get out.

20
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:31,684
- In high school. - She's certainly come up in the world.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,352
From Smallville, I mean.

22
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:45,796
- Lana! - Marco, darling. Save me some dessert.

23
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,514
Mr. Luthor.

24
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:00,650
Mr. Eelan. Make me happy.

25
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:05,486
The buyers are definitely interested, but they insist on a demonstration.

26
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,128
Fine. Arrange it.

27
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:20,299
Finished. You look fabulous. Now go out there and wow the crowd.

28
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,912
We like your dress.

29
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:32,475
Thank you.

30
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,848
And we'd like it now!

31
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:41,027
Hey! What do you think you're doing? Put me down!

32
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:49,093
Lana?

33
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:57,508
Let me go, you fashion-disabled Amazon!

34
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:09,249
Keep your mouth shut, missy.

35
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:13,189
We got a room where you're gonna slip into something less expensive.

36
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,352
Look out!

37
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,397
Maybe you ladies haven't heard about me.

38
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,972
Yeah, we heard.

39
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:31,938
You like to save people.

40
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,726
I imagine you hear this a lot, but, thanks.

41
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,923
Hold on.

42
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:34,304
Red, blue, yellow. Primary, but it works in a superhero-ish kind of way.

43
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:38,501
- Let me guess, Martha sewed it for you. - What?

44
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:43,546
- By the way, Clark, how are the folks? - Lana!

45
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:46,153
Over here, men.

46
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,949
Lana, are you all right?

47
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:53,860
I'm fine, Lex, thanks to Superman.

48
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:58,598
You know, this is the first time I've been happy that alien showed up.

49
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,925
Me too.

50
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,140
- I still don't see how you knew. - Oh, come on, Clark.

51
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:11,073
Just because I'm gorgeous doesn't mean I'm stupid.

52
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,941
I saw you do the amazing things in high school...

53
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:17,448
then Superman shows up in Metropolis the same time as you do.

54
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:19,882
How do you know when I showed up in Metropolis?

55
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:23,715
I've been keeping track. Root beer float?

56
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,225
- See? I didn't forget. - Lana, I've come to warn you.

57
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:31,160
About Lex. I know. Everyone has.

58
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:34,233
Powerful men get those kinds of reputations.

59
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:37,630
And I like powerful men.

60
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:42,338
Lana, this is no joke. That man Luthor was speaking with tonight...

61
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,640
he's a known arms dealer, responsible for the deaths of thousands of people.

62
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:49,647
And you think Lex is buying weapons through him?

63
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,543
No. Selling.

64
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,913
I think Luthor's got a stockpile he's trying to unload.

65
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:58,422
Well, you're wrong. Besides, I know how to handle Lex.

66
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,924
I know how to handle most men, in fact.

67
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:04,531
It's only Clark Kent I've ever had any trouble pinning down.

68
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:11,104
- For me, Lana, just be careful. - For you, Clark, anything.

69
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:30,589
I just want to know what Superman was doing in your apartment last night.

70
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:33,859
And I want to know what business you have spying on me.

71
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,059
Are you jealous?

72
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:42,469
- Let's just say I'm curious. - He wanted to be sure I was all right.

73
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:46,341
And to warn me about you. He said you were a bad boy.

74
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,874
And what did you say?

75
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,387
I said I liked bad boys.

76
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:02,453
<i>- Your 11:30's here, Mr. Luthor.</i> - Show him in. Business.

77
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:16,466
- Well? - The merchandise is ready to ship.

78
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:20,045
When the client agrees to the terms, the deal will go through.

79
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:24,446
I've arranged for a demonstration. I think they'll be impressed.

80
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:28,453
- Where? - Down by the old Carter Mill, 1:00.

81
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:36,219
I'm telling you, she heard everything. I should take her for a nice little ride.

82
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,695
- No! - But she was listening.

83
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,891
Of course she was listening.

84
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:45,062
A woman like that is going to be curious about things, especially me.

85
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:50,341
Anyway, what does it matter? She couldn't possibly have understood what it meant.

86
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:55,573
<i>- Hello.</i> - Clark, it's Lana. You were right.

87
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:59,015
<i>And the deal's going down today.</i>

88
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:17,462
The rifle shoots a microwave beam, exciting electrons to their highest state.

89
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,476
- Nothing's happening. - Wait.

90
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,447
I'm gonna like this gun.

91
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,063
I think it's deer season.

92
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:57,775
Sorry. It's only open season on terrorists.

93
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,934
I should warn you, it's been done.

94
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,571
The terrorists are keeping their mouths shut.

95
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,471
But those weapons had Luthor written all over them.

96
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:39,408
I wish I knew where he was keeping them stockpiled.

97
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,673
Don't forget, you still have me.

98
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,317
Oh, no, I don't. It's too dangerous.

99
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:47,716
- But we make such a perfect team. - No.

100
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:52,058
I could be your trusty sidekick, your Dr. Watson, your Batgirl.

101
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:56,990
- Definitely no. - I still have feelings for you, Clark.

102
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:01,124
I knew it the minute I saw you. Don't pretend you didn't feel something.

103
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:04,266
Let me prove to you how good we could be together.

104
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,100
Lana, I don't...

105
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:16,281
I've seen enough.

106
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,919
I'm glad you could finally make time for me, Lana.

107
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,026
I was beginning to think you were trying to avoid me.

108
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:39,960
You're not getting rid of me, Lex. I'm sticking to you like glue.

109
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:46,229
Then I'll see you tonight for dinner. Mercy will pick you up at 7.

110
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:47,963
It's Eelan.

111
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:51,037
- Yes? <i>- There's a problem.</i>

112
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,905
I don't care. I want you in Central City waiting.

113
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,106
The client expects the shipment to be ready tonight. There'd better not be...

114
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:00,877
any surprise visitors this time.

115
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:06,863
Hello?

116
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,724
<i>Clark, I've been trying to reach you all day.</i>

117
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:14,332
The reason you haven't been able to find the merchandise in Metropolis is...

118
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:17,491
it isn't in Metropolis. It's in Central City.

119
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:20,900
<i>- Our friend has a factory there.</i> - How do you know this?

120
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:25,669
I overheard him. Oh, Clark, this is how it could be forever.

121
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:28,836
Me ferreting out crooks, you catching them.

122
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:32,450
Lana, I told you I didn't want you spying on Lex anymore.

123
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:34,915
<i>I wasn't. I was sitting right next to him.</i>

124
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:38,921
- Lana. - That must be the limo. Gotta run.

125
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:45,291
Remember, Central City is 500 miles away. I suggest you schedule a flight.

126
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:48,160
Lana, wait!

127
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,888
Sorry I'm late.

128
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:19,561
- Where's Mercy? - Sorry, no mercy tonight.

129
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:36,113
Just heard from Eelan. Should I cancel your dinner reservations?

130
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,249
Get out.

131
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:40,111
Get out!

132
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,431
Let me go, you maniac! Help! Help!

133
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:38,268
That won't do you any good, Ms. Lang. Nobody's here.

134
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:41,344
The factory is automated because of the lead fumes.

135
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:45,745
There's so much lead residue on the walls, Superman couldn't see through them.

136
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,715
Even if he weren't in Central City.

137
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:56,421
You're right, Eelan. I couldn't see you, but my hearing's pretty good.

138
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:29,725
What are you doing here? I thought you'd be in Central City.

139
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:32,887
You overheard too much. It was too easy.

140
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:36,795
I knew Central City had to be a setup, so I followed you.

141
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,907
Hurry. You'll be safe in here.

142
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,087
He calls this safe?

143
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:40,888
Yes!

144
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,775
Help! Help!

145
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:20,120
Clark! Clark!

146
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,027
You're a mess.

147
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:55,896
Lana! Going somewhere?

148
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:59,798
To Paris for the unveiling of the spring line. I think my strengths...

149
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,169
- are in fashion, not crime-fighting. - Lana, you know I really care about you.

150
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,936
- You're like... - Clark Kent, if you say I'm like...

151
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,478
a sister to you, I'm going back to Lex.

152
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:13,879
Sorry. But I know you'll find that special person someday.

153
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:17,878
So will you. You deserve it.

154
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:23,016
- Someone quiet, understanding, patient. - Hey, Smallville.

155
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,753
Get your tail in here. Perry's got an assignment for us.

156
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:34,264
Remember, if you ever change your mind about me, feel free to fly on up any time.

157
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,700
Kent!

158
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,906
Coming.
