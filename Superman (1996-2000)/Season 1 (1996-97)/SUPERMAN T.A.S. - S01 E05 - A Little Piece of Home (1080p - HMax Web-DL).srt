1
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,019
As you know...

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,058
recent cutbacks forced the city to close many of its own museums.

3
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,166
Which is why the Lex Luthor Museum of Natural History...

4
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,928
is such a boon to the city's populace.

5
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,903
And a boost to Lex's popularity.

6
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:23,541
In anticipation of tomorrow's grand opening...

7
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,644
I felt that you, the elite of the Metropolis press...

8
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:31,476
might enjoy a sneak preview of the city's newest state-of-the-art exhibition hall.

9
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,916
<i>The priceless artifacts are displayed in open cases...</i>

10
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,317
<i>protected by electronic surveillance...</i>

11
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,152
<i>and an impregnable automated security system.</i>

12
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:47,295
- Did you hear that? - Just typical Luthor blarney.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,700
And now I will be happy to answer any questions...

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,136
regarding the museum and its displays.

15
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,475
How do you respond to charges...

16
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,917
that the museum is really just a large tax shelter for LexCorp?

17
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:13,719
Let's see him get out of... Kent?

18
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:18,458
I wouldn't.

19
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,165
You never listen.

20
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,956
What do you think we'll get for it, Nito?

21
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,753
I'd say five to 10...

22
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,919
with time off for good behavior.

23
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:03,340
I hope you're planning on cleaning up this mess.

24
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:15,885
You know, we can keep this up all day, or you...

25
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,684
You know, you don't look so hot.

26
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:25,553
Maybe we should help him.

27
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,790
Sure, we'll send him some chicken soup.

28
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,195
Come on!

29
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,368
Now, if you'll all just follow me.

30
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:40,969
<i>Lex Luthor.</i>

31
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,212
Ladies and gentlemen...

32
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:46,408
I give you the Lex Luthor Museum of...

33
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,053
Thieves.

34
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:52,884
Two.

35
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:54,582
Stole the jewels.

36
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,091
I tried...

37
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,326
Get a security crew down here now.

38
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,630
I thought... I could stop them.

39
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,501
Next time you see one of my museums being robbed...

40
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:11,973
call someone who can do something about it, like the police.

41
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,768
What happened?

42
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,208
I don't know.

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,508
I'm... I'm sorry.

44
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,455
Nito and Sam Corali.

45
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,923
See that they're dealt with.

46
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,686
Check.

47
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:35,533
Wait. Go back.

48
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,369
Interesting. As soon as he gets near the rocks...

49
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,371
in that display case, he gets all wobbly and weak.

50
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,475
So weak that he let a couple of small-timers get away.

51
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:49,375
And every one of those rocks belongs to me.

52
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,516
And here we have some fine examples...

53
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:55,085
of the crockery and dinnerware of the ancient Babylonians.

54
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,951
Their practice of fabricating utensils out of soft metal alloys...

55
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:03,083
proved to be their undoing as the entire civilization was destroyed...

56
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,288
by systemic metallic poisoning.

57
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,830
Nothing's happening.

58
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,836
You were expecting them to dance for you?

59
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,035
I like the stuff they had in there before.

60
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,268
- Before? - Yesterday.

61
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,744
They came in this morning and changed the whole display around.

62
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:26,248
The other meteor samples were ordinary carbon-based elements.

63
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,613
But this, its composition materials...

64
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,846
are not even on the periodic table.

65
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:33,719
We believe it originated in an alien solar system...

66
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:37,021
with properties totally divergent from our own.

67
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:39,687
We'll need to test it out on Superman himself.

68
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:42,433
See that it's in my office within the hour.

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,536
I don't think you realize what you have here.

70
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:49,470
On the contrary, I know exactly what I have here.

71
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:54,705
The very tool I need to completely control and humiliate Superman.

72
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,281
But surely the rock would be more valuable to mankind.

73
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,419
You work for me, Peterson. Don't forget that.

74
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:05,990
There shouldn't be an opinion in your head that I haven't put there.

75
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,388
Yes, Mr. Luthor.

76
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:11,558
Two points.

77
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,263
- Two... - Does Perry know you're playing...

78
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:21,372
- basketball on his time? - It helps me think.

79
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,008
Why didn't he nab those two museum thieves?

80
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,144
- It doesn't make sense. - Who?

81
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,605
Who? Superman.

82
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,079
Free throw. Three-point play.

83
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,582
By the way, where'd you run off to yesterday?

84
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,984
- Yeah? - Ms. Lane?

85
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,491
It's Professor Peterson.

86
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,423
So, what have you got for me this time, professor?

87
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:47,957
Something extraordinary, Ms. Lane.

88
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:50,658
Quite literally extraordinary.

89
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:56,599
Impressive, huh? I like to stay in shape.

90
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,934
- Want to feel? - Feel what?

91
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,071
I don't think she's interested.

92
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:05,842
Sure she is. Aren't you, baby?

93
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:14,221
Don't call me "baby."

94
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,789
Yeah, well...

95
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:20,659
like I told you people over the phone, I don't do Metropolis.

96
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,664
Not since the blue guy showed up.

97
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:26,995
This job needs someone with your technical expertise.

98
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,069
I pull this heist of yours, it's a sure bet I'll get caught.

99
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,710
You don't understand.

100
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,574
That's exactly what I want.

101
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,384
Be with you in a second, sir.

102
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:53,425
- Good catch. What'll it be? - I'd like the turkey loaf, baked potato...

103
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:57,500
no butter, no soup, salad, dressing on the side. Give it all legs.

104
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,459
Sorry, Kent. I'm in a hurry.

105
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:01,333
Say, you don't look so hot.

106
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,139
I'm fine.

107
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:04,536
What's the rush?

108
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,012
Take a look at this.

109
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,215
- Careful! - I'm sorry.

110
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:14,977
Just clumsy, I guess.

111
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,348
What is it?

112
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,547
LexLabs got a hold of some meteor...

113
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:22,625
that seems to be able to drain Superman's powers.

114
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,523
This is just a small sliver.

115
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:28,097
- You sure you're not catching something? - I'm okay.

116
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:29,858
Really.

117
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:34,233
I'm taking this piece over to S.T.A.R. Labs to let them have a look at it.

118
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,104
I'll let you know what they say.

119
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:43,611
The gentleman would like a large orange juice, chicken soup and tea with lemon.

120
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:47,240
You gotta take care of yourself, Smallville.

121
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:49,978
Yeah, you really don't look so good.

122
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:16,307
Transfer of the treasury plates to the Metropolis district office is official.

123
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,810
The plates are yours, Commissioner Jones.

124
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:25,581
I'll take those plates now, Commissioner Jones.

125
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:29,659
Now, I'd like you all to drop your weapons and kick them over here.

126
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,497
You don't wanna make trouble for me, commissioner.

127
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,378
You'll never get away with this.

128
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,486
By now, they've shut down all the exits and entrances...

129
00:09:56,653 --> 00:10:00,522
the stairs, the elevators. There's no way down off this roof.

130
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,660
How about up?

131
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:13,365
He's coming. Let's do it.

132
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,491
He's past checkpoint one...

133
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,064
<i>heading due north.</i>

134
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,127
Checkpoint number two.

135
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,434
<i>Checkpoint three.</i>

136
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,363
<i>- He's coming. - Good.</i>

137
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,804
<i>Now just remember what I told you.</i>

138
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,002
I guess I've flown myself into a corner.

139
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,307
Okay, you win.

140
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,347
I give up.

141
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,750
That's right. Make him come to you.

142
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:14,821
Here.

143
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,106
What's the matter?

144
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:32,334
Don't you want it? Here.

145
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:38,213
I'm sorry. Here. Let me help you up.

146
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:42,476
Hey, I guess all that time in the gym is paying off.

147
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:44,879
<i>Jab. Jab.</i>

148
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,489
<i>Cross. Uppercut.</i>

149
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:49,889
What are you doing? Get him back to the center of that room.

150
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,891
<i>Maybe I'd rather just finish him off right here.</i>

151
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:07,911
Mercy, get the rock, fast.

152
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,593
Supe, you don't look so good.

153
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,935
That's right. Put S.T.A.R. Labs on 24-hour surveillance.

154
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,936
I want to know everyone who goes in or out.

155
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:38,972
My spies tell me that Hamilton has a piece of my rock.

156
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,043
I'd like to know who gave it to him.

157
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,076
I'm on it.

158
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,618
If you'll excuse us.

159
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,553
Actually, I'm glad you came.

160
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,389
I have a deal to offer you.

161
00:13:58,562 --> 00:13:59,962
I'm listening.

162
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,266
As long as I have the rock...

163
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:03,900
you can't stop me.

164
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,128
But it is bothersome to have you always trying...

165
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,772
so the deal is this:

166
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,101
You leave me and my operations alone...

167
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:15,405
and I and my little green rock will leave you alone.

168
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,980
I don't make deals with criminals.

169
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,414
I control everything in this town, Superman.

170
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:24,419
Your cooperation is not really necessary.

171
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:27,752
The offer was merely a courtesy.

172
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:30,792
You will never control me, Luthor.

173
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,793
Never.

174
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:35,994
Well, then...

175
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,692
I guess I'll have to kill you.

176
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:58,031
Yes.

177
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,638
Interesting.

178
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:12,675
My contact at LexLabs thinks it isn't even from this solar system.

179
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:14,977
Incredible.

180
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:16,486
What?

181
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,557
That certainly would be in keeping with my theory.

182
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,523
Which is what, exactly, professor?

183
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,795
The fact that your body absorbs the radiation so readily...

184
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:30,266
leads me to believe you share with it a point of origin.

185
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:32,029
You mean it came from Krypton?

186
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:35,866
More than likely it is Krypton, or, rather, a small piece of it.

187
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,373
Kryptonite, if you will.

188
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:40,877
The radiation could have been created by the energy released...

189
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,880
in the explosion which destroyed your planet.

190
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,042
There is one bit of potentially helpful data.

191
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:52,055
Its radiation can be shielded by element atomic number 82.

192
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:01,558
- Lead. - Of course.

193
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:06,300
- Yeah? - Ms. Lane, it's Peterson.

194
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:07,701
Listen closely.

195
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:11,605
LexLabs is developing a synthetic version of the green rock.

196
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:15,214
It's imperative I get this information to Superman immediately.

197
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,509
Yes, of course. Where should we meet?

198
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:20,312
<i>The museum. Come in through the alley entrance.</i>

199
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:22,045
But the security system.

200
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:25,214
<i>I designed the security system, Ms. Lane.</i>

201
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:27,223
<i>I know how to bypass it.</i>

202
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:33,094
<i>The door will be open between 9:05 and 9:06. Make sure you're not followed.</i>

203
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:35,666
Very convincing.

204
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:38,330
You're certain he's there?

205
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,269
Our men saw him go in minutes after the Lane woman.

206
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,775
Excellent. Superman will now insist on accompanying her to the museum.

207
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,176
Professor...

208
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:52,341
Mercy will see you safely home now. Won't you, my dear?

209
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:56,683
Please. No. I mean, I can see myself home. Really.

210
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,618
But I insist.

211
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,693
Metropolis can be such a dangerous city, Peterson.

212
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,126
I'd hate to wake up tomorrow and find out...

213
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:06,856
that something terrible had happened to you.

214
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,305
He said the back alley between...

215
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,844
Right on time.

216
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,345
Wait.

217
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:24,541
Let me check it out.

218
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:29,553
I don't see anyone. Lois?

219
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:31,618
Professor?

220
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,315
Professor Peterson?

221
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:52,808
Kryptonite.

222
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,821
Lois! Get the Kryptonite out of here.

223
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:25,702
Two annoyances with one stone.

224
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,006
If only we had some lead.

225
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:39,591
Entire civilization was destroyed by systemic metallic poisoning.

226
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:50,034
The cups... they're made of lead.

227
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:21,065
Lane squares off.

228
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,600
She aims. She shoots.

229
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:31,134
Two points.

230
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:58,267
No!

231
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,255
Thank you, Superman.

232
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,859
No, Lois. Thank you.

233
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:24,022
- You saved my life. - I suppose I did.

234
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:26,028
I owe you one.

235
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:30,863
I'd say an exclusive interview would just about even us up.

236
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,634
All right.

237
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,604
Under one condition:

238
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:38,642
You don't print anything about the Kryptonite.

239
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,315
No, green. It has to be green.
