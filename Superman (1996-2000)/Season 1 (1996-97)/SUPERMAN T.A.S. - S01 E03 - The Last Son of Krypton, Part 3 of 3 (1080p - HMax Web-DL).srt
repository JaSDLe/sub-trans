1
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,294
Nice one, Clark.

2
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,532
- Look out. It's gonna hit us! - My God!

3
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,258
Run, run, run!

4
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,862
- Oh, my gosh. - Jump!

5
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:25,063
Did you see that?

6
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:29,662
Freeze it.

7
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:32,498
What is that? Can anyone tell me?

8
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:34,700
Looks like a flying guy.

9
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:37,930
No kidding. I know he's flying, but who is he?

10
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:40,833
Where did he come from? What does he want?

11
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:44,230
- Look who I'm asking. - Nice S.

12
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:48,567
- Excuse me? - Right here. He's strong. He flies.

13
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,934
He's the Nietzschean fantasy ideal all wrapped up in a red cape.

14
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:56,096
- The superman. - Superman?

15
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,705
Hey, I like it.

16
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:02,170
Superman. It's catchy, sticks with you. The kind of name that looks great...

17
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,670
splashed across three columns... Four...

18
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:07,602
provided one of you can get an interview with him.

19
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:11,502
Somehow, I don't think a guy like that has a press agent, chief.

20
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:14,664
Well, somebody better get something on this guy fast.

21
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,534
I've never seen the city in such a state. Look at these faxes.

22
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:22,072
If we don't get answers soon there could be a full-scale panic.

23
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:26,240
We've kept this book since you left Smallville.

24
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:29,739
Every time we read about an invisible angel helping someone...

25
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:31,898
we knew our Clark had to be nearby.

26
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:36,771
But now that I've settled in Metropolis, it's impossible to keep a low profile.

27
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,238
I can see where landing a plane in the middle of the city might turn a few heads.

28
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,501
It's not just that. Suddenly, people are calling me Superman.

29
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:49,040
They want to know everything about me. Some are afraid of me...

30
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,072
like Jor-El and Lara warned.

31
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:54,274
Does this mean I'm going to have to give up my life?

32
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:58,206
No, son. It doesn't matter where you were born or what you can do.

33
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:02,503
You'll always be Clark Kent. Superman just helps out now and then.

34
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,973
It wouldn't be bad if people knew a little more about Superman.

35
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:09,542
I don't want anyone thinking you're like that nut in Gotham City.

36
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,144
There must be some way to get the word out.

37
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:17,439
Sorry, Perry. I checked with Star Labs...

38
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,510
and they're just as clueless as everyone else about our fly boy.

39
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:24,736
Right. I'm heading back now.

40
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:28,834
Excuse me, Miss Lane. I believe I'm the one you want to talk to.

41
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,409
Oh, yeah? Well, where are you?

42
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:35,345
I'm... Just hang on.

43
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,207
As far as I can piece together...

44
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:50,402
I'm the last survivor of a planet called Krypton.

45
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:52,578
Krypton?

46
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:54,939
Okay.

47
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:57,579
You don't believe me?

48
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,769
It's a little much.

49
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,310
Fair enough.

50
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,571
All I ask is that you tell the truth.

51
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,843
- And that is? - I'm not here to scare anyone.

52
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:11,643
In fact, I've always tried to help people whenever possible.

53
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:14,905
You sound too good to be true. What's your secret?

54
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:16,773
What do you mean?

55
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:20,072
You don't go around in blue tights and a cape all the time.

56
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,770
What do you do in your off-hours?

57
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,570
I think that's a question for another time.

58
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:36,044
Well, well, an alien in my own back yard.

59
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,846
And such a civic-minded one too.

60
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:41,447
I think he means what he says, Lex.

61
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,411
Well, that's just dandy, Lois.

62
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:48,015
All I know is, your hero did nothing to help me.

63
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:51,172
I'm the one who's out a billion-dollar battle suit.

64
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:54,578
Actually, this could end up a silver lining in your pocket.

65
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,340
What's that?

66
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,745
Since the terrorists have your prototype...

67
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:02,474
the Pentagon's gonna want you to build a better version for them.

68
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:07,344
When all is said and done, this could net you a multi-billion dollar windfall.

69
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:11,114
Lois, it almost sounds as if your friend here...

70
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:14,681
is suggesting I should be glad my suit was stolen.

71
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:18,749
You're very amusing, Mr... Kent, is it?

72
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,077
Yes, I'll remember that.

73
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,749
Nice work, Smallville.

74
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:28,413
You're only the second person I've seen get under Lex's skin.

75
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,415
- Who's the first? - Me. When I dumped him.

76
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,211
Ancient history. What makes you think...

77
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:38,010
Lex might have been an accessory to the theft?

78
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:42,515
I don't think it was a theft. I think he gave it away.

79
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,884
I was digging up background info on Luthor...

80
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:55,985
and found this photo at last year's International Industrial Conference.

81
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:58,545
Recognize the guy with the medals?

82
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:01,651
The regent of Kaznia. So?

83
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,547
So the U.S. and Kaznia haven't been on real friendly terms lately.

84
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,654
It seems the regent's been employing

85
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,153
terrorists to eliminate his political enemies.

86
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,876
Old news, Kent. The president broke diplomatic ties with Kaznia months ago.

87
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:18,020
Which means Luthor couldn't sell the regent a war suit...

88
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:20,210
without it being an act of treason.

89
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:24,347
So Luthor just left the back door open for him to take it.

90
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,949
- It works in theory. - In theory, maybe...

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,643
but Perry White doesn't run theories.

92
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,910
- Where are you going? - I'd tell you...

93
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,554
but you'd have to share the byline.

94
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,246
I've told you before, there's no work for you on this ship.

95
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,350
Now leave, before I call the harbor police.

96
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:52,580
I'm going, you blasted rat bag, I'm going.

97
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,187
Blasted scabs taking jobs from us union men.

98
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:59,345
I ought to go back and split some skulls, I ought to.

99
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:02,683
Got a tire iron right here.

100
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:18,779
Oh, it's you, Miss Lane. Come to do another smuggling story?

101
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,684
Maybe. What can you tell me about that tanker?

102
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,522
It's the darndest thing I ever seen.

103
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,885
She's been in port a week and ain't moved a bit of cargo on or off.

104
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,821
Blasted scow's leaving port tonight, and I says good riddance.

105
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,389
Gotta get on that ship.

106
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,786
Bibbo, take this and call Clark Kent at the <i>Planet.</i>

107
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:42,288
Tell him where I am and to call Police Commissioner Henderson...

108
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,948
if he doesn't hear from me in 20 minutes. Got that? 20 minutes.

109
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:49,216
Thanks, Bibbo. I owe you one.

110
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,892
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

111
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,753
Call Kurt Kent, let him know about the boat...

112
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,892
and said something about the police. Yeah, okay.

113
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,958
Hey, soda.

114
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,884
She'll be okay.

115
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,356
We're not giving interviews, you got that?

116
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,550
- If I could just speak to your captain. - I said no interviews.

117
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:18,489
- What part of that don't you understand? - Hans. Hans!

118
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:22,121
There's no reason for hostility...

119
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:26,158
especially towards such an attractive visitor.

120
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,622
I'm John Corben, special attaché to the regent.

121
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:34,160
- How may I help you, Miss...? - Lois Lane, <i>Daily Planet.</i>

122
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:36,294
I'm doing a story on gun smuggling...

123
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,655
and was wondering if I could ask about your cargo.

124
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,288
But we have no cargo.

125
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:46,656
You must know there's a trade embargo between the U.S. and Kaznia.

126
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,987
We're part of a diplomatic envoy...

127
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:53,152
trying to restore friendly relations between our countries.

128
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,726
Then you won't mind me taking a look around.

129
00:10:55,895 --> 00:11:00,988
Better yet, why don't we continue this interview ashore, say, over dinner?

130
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:05,823
I'd be more than happy to answer any questions that you might have.

131
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,561
I can think of some doozies.

132
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,696
I'll bet.

133
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:20,323
Here's a shot of Luthor getting a commendation.

134
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:22,725
A shot of the special crimes unit.

135
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:26,557
And I took this at the dedication of the zoo's polar bear exhibit.

136
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,492
- Cute little guy. - Yeah, nice.

137
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,558
You didn't see Miss Lane come back, did you?

138
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,856
She brought me along to get shots for her smuggling story.

139
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,020
- Is that right? - Yeah, have a look.

140
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:45,429
Yeah, I figure a few more shots like that and Perry's bound to put me on staff.

141
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:49,189
There, in the background. That ship's a Kaznian tanker.

142
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:53,386
It's so small. How can you tell?

143
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:56,198
Clark?

144
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:13,798
You're making a big mistake. Everyone in my office knows where I am.

145
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,723
Sweetheart, if anyone knew or cared, they would have made a move by now.

146
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:27,762
We're clear. Lose her.

147
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,063
You again? Get him!

148
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,165
Take cover.

149
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:35,933
Thanks.

150
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,967
Anytime.

151
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,060
So long, sweetheart.

152
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:04,868
Call the police and let them know what's happening. I'll try to stop it.

153
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:06,403
Be...

154
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,869
careful.

155
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:24,303
This is Corben. Tell the regent his battle suit is coming to him by special delivery.

156
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,566
Everyone, clear the area now.

157
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,036
Stupid, stupid move, my friend.

158
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,869
No!

159
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,442
Gotcha.

160
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:53,776
Shall we go a few rounds without the suit?

161
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,144
Too bad.

162
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,248
Yeah, chief, I think stopping the presses would be a very good idea.

163
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:10,282
You see, as the agreed-upon merchandise never left Metropolis...

164
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:14,748
my client, the regent, respectfully requests a full and prompt refund.

165
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:17,579
We had an understanding.

166
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:20,412
All I had to do was arrange for the regent's men...

167
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:22,677
to take possession, and they did.

168
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:27,717
Now because of this alien's interference you expect me to eat a billion dollars?

169
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:31,545
I think you have more pressing concerns at the moment.

170
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,686
Good day.

171
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,781
I'm afraid we already have a window washer.

172
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:48,250
Oh, the silent treatment.

173
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,510
Well, I don't know what you thought you heard...

174
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:55,017
but I know what you can prove. And it's nothing.

175
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:03,853
You see, Superman...

176
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:08,954
I own Metropolis. My technology built it, my will keeps it going...

177
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,952
and two-thirds of its people work for me, whether they know it or not.

178
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:16,350
Even you have to admit it's a model of efficiency.

179
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:24,018
And yet I've often thought, "Why limit myself to just one city?"

180
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:29,486
A being with your abilities could be very useful to me on a...

181
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:33,680
shall we say, global scale.

182
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:37,721
Why don't you float on in and we'll discuss it.

183
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,348
Say something!

184
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,286
I'll be watching you, Luthor.

185
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,347
Wait, I'm not finished with you!

186
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:56,281
- Hey, look. - There he is.

187
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:59,390
- Superman! - Get a shot. Superman, come on down.

188
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,581
Superman, give us an answer here.

189
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:05,816
Way to go, big guy. You're okay.

190
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:51,325
