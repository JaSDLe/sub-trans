1
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:10,539
Feel anything?

2
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,578
Nothing. I feel fine.

3
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:18,309
Now, this metal's too hard to be lead.

4
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:20,184
Titanium-lead alloy?

5
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:23,323
Exactly. And the helmet is leaded polycarbonate.

6
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,289
Materials that will not only withstand Kryptonite...

7
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,921
but, well, I took into account the type of day you'll likely put the suit through.

8
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:33,823
You make it sound like I go looking for trouble.

9
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,117
Hey, Rudy, today or what?

10
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:59,056
You screw this up, you can forget about me paying that bookie of yours.

11
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,956
I know, Mr. Lebeau.

12
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,966
Jeez! I thought you knew how to work that thing.

13
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,632
- Sorry. - You there, hold it!

14
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:20,246
- Oh, it's you, Rudy. - Hey, what's up?

15
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,509
- You get cleared for machinery? - Yeah. I'm a forklift operator now.

16
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,252
And who's your friend, huh? Doing some early Christmas shopping?

17
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:37,460
- He... - That's all right, Rudy.

18
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:40,224
Maybe I can clear all this up.

19
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,000
No, don't.

20
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:51,077
You'll get us put away for good.

21
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:53,975
Speak for yourself. I'm not getting caught.

22
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,288
<i>Emergency. Fire. Loading bay two.</i>

23
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,343
Hold it.

24
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,310
Hey, stop!

25
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,448
- Help, help! - Somebody get help!

26
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:32,813
Over here!

27
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,334
Oh, please stop!

28
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:00,138
Messed me up for the last time, you stupid little parasite.

29
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,241
Hey, slow down!

30
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:33,939
Mr. Lebeau, stop the truck! Please, stop!

31
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:39,615
Please, Martin... help me.

32
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,621
Adios, freak.

33
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,501
I just can't believe it. Wimpy Rudy Jones?

34
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:06,112
And there's no telling what was in those drums.

35
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,983
He ain't kidding. Half the stuff the prof whips

36
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,479
up, folks would kill to get their hands on.

37
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,514
This is four-two heading north on Old Ocean Road.

38
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:53,183
<i>- Hey, Gina, is that you?</i> - Edna, you on the graveyard shift tonight?

39
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,794
I was just...

40
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,494
You trying to get killed?

41
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,508
Hey, I'm talking to you.

42
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,675
What's that in your hand? Drop it!

43
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,853
<i>Four-two, please respond. Where'd you go? Gina, you okay?</i>

44
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:38,199
<i>All units, request assistance on Old Ocean Road.</i>

45
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:42,868
This is four-two. Negative on the assistance. I'm fine, Edna.

46
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:47,714
<i>10-4. You gave me a scare there. All units, disregard call for assistance.</i>

47
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:59,683
Edna? Where the heck did I get Edna?

48
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:31,635
She must've been delirious when our boys found her.

49
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:35,039
Said something about being attacked by a purple monster.

50
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:38,270
Was its name Barney?

51
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:41,281
You here to make ha-ha, kid, or take pictures?

52
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,219
Guess that's a no.

53
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:50,452
Wouldn't touch that if I were you.

54
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:52,923
Right, thanks.

55
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:56,327
Did you ID Rudy Jones' partner from the security cameras?

56
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,728
Yeah. Name's Martin Lebeau. He's a known fence.

57
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,133
Last we knew, he was living down by the docks in Hob's Bay.

58
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,155
Don't you recognize me, Marty?

59
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,367
It's your old doormat, Rudy Jones.

60
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:37,234
Rudy, you ought to be in a hospital. You need help.

61
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,072
Help? I never felt better in my life.

62
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,773
Hey.

63
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:47,373
It's fantastic, Marty. I should be thanking you.

64
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:53,018
When I touch somebody, I get strong. I absorb their energy.

65
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:58,221
But more than that, I hear their thoughts.

66
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,194
I know what they know.

67
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,356
Really, words don't describe it.

68
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,194
Here, let me show you.

69
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:14,541
Rudy? Rudy Jones?

70
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:16,870
Put that man down.

71
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:18,342
Sure.

72
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,745
What's happened to you?

73
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:25,877
I don't know. It's as if I've turned into some kind of monster.

74
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:29,423
- Can you help me? - Let me take you back to STAR.

75
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,926
- Maybe Professor Hamilton can treat you. - Okay, Superman.

76
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:36,327
- Just don't hurt me. - I won't. Hang on.

77
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:38,557
Oh, you can count on it.

78
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,241
Man, what a rush.

79
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,079
So that's what real power feels like.

80
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:54,975
- Good heavens. - What is that?

81
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,311
What's he done to Superman?

82
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:02,487
Looks like you still got some juice left in you.

83
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,534
You all see that?

84
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,701
That's the new me.

85
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:31,244
That's what Rudy Jones can do.

86
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,312
Now tell your friends...

87
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:35,754
there's a new Superman in town.

88
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,634
<i>Since this morning the thing that was once Rudy Jones has been sighted...</i>

89
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:51,497
<i>throughout the city, taking what he pleases</i>

90
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,402
<i>and driving citizens into their homes in fear.</i>

91
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:58,575
I spoke personally with Professor Emil Hamilton of STAR Labs...

92
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:02,912
<i>to find out how a simple janitor could clean out Metropolis.</i>

93
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,783
<i>The chemical Mr. Jones stole was developed</i>

94
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,485
<i>to catalyze energy absorption in human cells.</i>

95
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:11,593
<i>But clearly, he was exposed to far greater quantities...</i>

96
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,093
<i>than we'd ever tested on living subjects.</i>

97
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:18,831
<i>And now that this Parasite has sucked up all of Superman's powers...</i>

98
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:22,665
<i>how much longer until he sucks our city dry?</i>

99
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,501
Wow. That sounds pretty bad.

100
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,943
Just fighting a bit of a cold.

101
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:31,406
No. I mean this Parasite thing.

102
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,275
I wonder where Superman is.

103
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,483
I'm sure he'd be here if he could.

104
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:36,914
Clark Kent.

105
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:38,744
That's right.

106
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:43,291
Thanks, we'll be right over. Let's take a ride. There may be some good news.

107
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,566
Like candy from a baby.

108
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,400
Huh? What gives?

109
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:15,387
Then about an hour ago, I just started feeling better.

110
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:17,890
My doctor says I can go home tomorrow.

111
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,723
Then the Parasite's drain is temporary.

112
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:24,526
Hey, you figure Superman's out there feeling better too?

113
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,039
I wouldn't be surprised.

114
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:34,141
Given the officer's recovery, Perry...

115
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,279
I bet we'll be seeing Superman anytime now.

116
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,938
Me? Yeah, my cold's doing better.

117
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:43,347
In fact, I thought I'd change and go out tonight.

118
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,613
Right. So long.

119
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,661
Good to see you again, Superman.

120
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,466
Or should I say "Clark"?

121
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:09,844
That's right, Kent. I got your powers, I got your thoughts...

122
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,742
and I got your secret.

123
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,835
- Comfy? - Where are we?

124
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:36,904
Why don't you use your x-ray vision?

125
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,472
I can't.

126
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:41,009
Ah, shucks.

127
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:45,045
Well, all you need to know is it ain't your apartment.

128
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,046
It's mine now.

129
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:49,242
Fits my new ritzy lifestyle.

130
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:52,115
When I don't go to work, people will come looking for me.

131
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:56,581
"Hi, Perry? That cold of mine is acting up again.

132
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,387
I think I'm going to be out sick for a while."

133
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,231
You see, Supes, you're my new meal plan.

134
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:07,664
Figure I'll keep you here, pop back every 12 hours or so for a recharge.

135
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,739
In fact, it's feeding time right about now.

136
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:39,183
It's been a week, people. This is a newspaper, we need facts.

137
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:43,693
Where does Parasite disappear to? Is Superman alive or dead?

138
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:46,388
And where the heck is Kent? Is he still out sick?

139
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:47,895
I was just noticing...

140
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,199
Parasite always flies south, along the coast.

141
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,839
That's toward S.T.A.R, where he used to work.

142
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:56,267
The police thought of that the first day.

143
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:59,240
Besides, it's not like the guy's going back to work.

144
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,909
But maybe the cops haven't checked out STAR lately.

145
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,947
Somebody should go down there.

146
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,496
And somebody should get his photos to

147
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,351
layout before he misses the evening edition.

148
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:12,718
- But, chief... - Okay, where were we?

149
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:17,158
Troupe, what's your excuse? Weaver, justify your existence. Lois...

150
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:26,874
So much is written on what Parasite does, I

151
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:29,236
thought if I looked around his workspace...

152
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:32,378
maybe I could learn about Rudy Jones, the man.

153
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:35,776
It's just that you seem kind of young for a reporter...

154
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:39,014
Mr. White.

155
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:43,548
<i>Yeah, I know my age surprises people.</i>

156
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,517
<i>Did start out pretty young.</i>

157
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,956
<i>- Paper route at 7...</i> - Jimmy.

158
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:51,190
Well, I guess you can't do any harm in here.

159
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:53,628
I'll be right outside if you need me.

160
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,165
All right.

161
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,826
I mean, great, thanks.

162
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,113
Oh, yeah, great.

163
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,185
Stop the presses. Olsen gets exclusive on empty broom closet.

164
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,697
S-O-S.

165
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,765
No way.

166
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:50,150
Superman.

167
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:54,455
Jimmy, quick. Where are we?

168
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,320
You don't know? You're in STAR Labs.

169
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,124
The cellar, or something.

170
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:01,493
Go up and get help. You can't stay here.

171
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,567
He'll be back any minute.

172
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,304
I can get you out of here.

173
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,250
He's back. Quick, hide.

174
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,358
Good evening, dinner.

175
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,862
Enjoy your night out?

176
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:37,796
You better believe it.

177
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:41,101
My whole life, everybody's been stepping on me.

178
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:43,333
Now I'm the one with all the power.

179
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,574
And what have you done with all this power, Rudy?

180
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:50,739
Gave the world the raw deal they gave you? Feel like you've gotten even yet?

181
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:56,385
What's with the chatter all of a sudden? You're up to something.

182
00:17:58,523 --> 00:17:59,889
Somebody's here.

183
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:12,499
Cute, kid.

184
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,340
Hey, Rudy.

185
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:35,991
Clear out of here now.

186
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:07,458
Playing hide-and-seek now? Come on, Kent, this is beneath you.

187
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,142
You're wasting your time.

188
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:32,312
I'm still stronger.

189
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,384
Maybe, but for how long?

190
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:46,363
You've got a point. Guess I ought to end this quick.

191
00:19:57,342 --> 00:20:00,141
Time to say good night.

192
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:17,485
We'll keep him here until a special cell is completed at Stryker's.

193
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:20,530
He's been like this ever since his fight with Superman.

194
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:24,325
I doubt he knows his own name, let alone any of what's transpired.

195
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,005
We're disturbing him. We should go.

196
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,400
Yeah. Doesn't look like he'll be giving interviews anytime soon.
