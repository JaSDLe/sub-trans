1
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,065
I can't believe it.

2
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,697
Not only has Lobo failed to deliver your thieving brother, Sqweek...

3
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:20,570
but now you tell me that Lobo's taken a bribe...

4
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:22,232
to let Sqweek escape.

5
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,673
It's true, Emperor Spewge, on my honor as a bounty hunter.

6
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,736
Lobo has broken his word.

7
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:31,244
He'll pay for that!

8
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,744
Find him, Gnaww.

9
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:38,077
Drag Lobo and that worthless brother of yours back here...

10
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,615
alive or in pieces!

11
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:44,352
Got it.

12
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,517
Thanks for returning my uniform.

13
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:48,017
Now how about my ship?

14
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:52,748
Impossible. For ages, I have preserved many rare creatures...

15
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:56,016
even some from your adopted planet Earth.

16
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,351
I'm not an animal to be stuck in a cage.

17
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:01,652
Normally, I don't take sentient beings...

18
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:04,488
but you and Lobo are all that survive...

19
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:07,356
from your respective home worlds.

20
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:11,429
The Zarnian seems to be adjusting to his new surroundings.

21
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:14,622
I suggest you do the same.

22
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:24,530
Rise and shine, big boy.

23
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:26,966
Pinch me, I'm dreaming.

24
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:31,404
No, I'm not. It's a party, right? I can deal with that.

25
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:34,541
You babes sit tight, and I'll grab us some suds.

26
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:39,369
Man, I don't know where I am or how I got here, but I'm glad I...

27
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:44,310
- Morning. - Suddenly it's all coming back to me.

28
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,003
Where's that little creep that locked me in here?

29
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:49,306
When I get my hands on him, I'll...

30
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:55,647
Take it easy, swookums.

31
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,579
No need to get rowdy.

32
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:06,381
Gas! Back off, you blasted robo-bims.

33
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,961
There. Nice and peaceful.

34
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:25,260
No one fights here.

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,477
Sorry, fella, but you're my ticket out of here.

36
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,250
A disturbance in the south wing, sir.

37
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:36,587
Send the security probes.

38
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,068
Yo, Supes.

39
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:59,930
You ain't gonna bail without your old pal Lobo, are you?

40
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:03,664
If any creature in the galaxy deserves to be locked up, it's you.

41
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,500
Why, you dirty...

42
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,674
Lobie, are you getting rowdy again?

43
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,170
Oh, no, no. I'm cool.

44
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:14,505
Come on, cut me a break. They keep me so pumped with gas, I can hardly move.

45
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,008
I gotta get out of here.

46
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:19,510
So you can attack the Earth again? I don't think so.

47
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:25,346
All right. I don't need you! I'm the Main Man.

48
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,608
You hear me, you rag-fragging geek-wad.

49
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,444
Oh, my. Such language.

50
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:35,116
It might take me a week.

51
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:37,186
It might take me 10 years.

52
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,481
But I'm gonna bust out...

53
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:44,681
and kick that big red S of yours all over the galaxy.

54
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:49,849
Right after I'm done nuking the Earth into guacamole.

55
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:53,522
And that's... a promise.

56
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:02,296
If I let you out...

57
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,956
do you swear to leave me and everyone else on Earth in peace?

58
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,568
The Main Man's word is his bond, man.

59
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:21,362
Oh, jinkies. The Preserver won't like this one bit.

60
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,004
Come here, sweet things.

61
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,504
Dang, that felt good.

62
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,374
Hey, blue, thanks.

63
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:51,610
What was that for?

64
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:54,378
Didn't want you to think I'm going soft on you.

65
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,919
<i>Return to your enclosures.</i>

66
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,588
Who's gonna make us?

67
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:29,167
- Thanks, bigmouth. - I didn't know they were armed.

68
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,868
Neither one of us is back to full strength.

69
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,444
If they drag us back, they'll probably strap

70
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,599
our butts to the floor with razor wire.

71
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:41,799
Not that it ain't a pleasurable way to perk up an evening.

72
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,205
But I do have me that prisoner to deliver.

73
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,674
- We need a decoy to draw their fire. - Elected.

74
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,402
Hey!

75
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,618
Fragger.

76
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,650
Come on.

77
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:38,289
Soon as that gas wears off...

78
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:42,367
I'm grinding that Preserver into kibble and feeding him to his varmints.

79
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:46,061
- We should just get our ships and leave. - You want to run? Fine.

80
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:49,932
Your wimpy little toy rocket is in the south hangar, where I left it.

81
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:54,540
Me, I'm staying to feed Wrinkles 31 different flavors of pain.

82
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:58,539
I give the lessons in discipline here, Zarnian.

83
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,508
I think I stepped in something.

84
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:38,420
Thanks. I owe you.

85
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,699
Whoa, that's gonna hurt.

86
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,870
Lobo, thought you said you owed me.

87
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,296
What, now?

88
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,863
Oh, whoopdie-fragging-do.

89
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:27,375
Belt?

90
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,543
I may have to capture them myself.

91
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,049
<i>Preserver, another ship is hailing us.</i>

92
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:40,551
<i>We've tracked the bounty hunter Lobo to your ship.</i>

93
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,415
<i>Hand him over at once.</i>

94
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:45,055
Better yet, come and get him.

95
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,590
This is sweet. Quench me, babe.

96
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,732
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

97
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,993
Say "aloha," babe.

98
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:22,497
The docking bay's on the other side of the jungle. We're home free.

99
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,161
Don't bet on it.

100
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,166
Move in, boys. Without their powers, these wimps are dead meat.

101
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,338
Let's go get them.

102
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:10,488
Hey, Lobo, remember us?

103
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,430
- Friends of yours? - My bridge club.

104
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,438
It's my brother, Gnaww. He's come to rescue me.

105
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:43,005
In your dreams, Sqweek.

106
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,667
We followed your bike's ion trail.

107
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:54,778
It was stronger than your breath.

108
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:58,812
Hey, watch what you say about my bike.

109
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,240
We're no match for their weapons.

110
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,410
Tell me about it.

111
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,118
They're trying to surround us.

112
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,455
At least I'll go down fragging.

113
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,850
Wait.

114
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,852
I see something else. It's... What? What?

115
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,460
Get to the docking bay. I'll hold them off here.

116
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:32,989
Your funeral, Clyde.

117
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:00,030
Now, what were you up to?

118
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,072
Oh, I get it.

119
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,040
You were going to sic one of the Preserver's bloodthirsty beasts on us.

120
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:10,377
Well, maybe we'll let whatever's in there rip into you.

121
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:13,876
- You don't want to do that. - Oh, yes we do.

122
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,406
Throw him in.

123
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:39,181
That's a bloodthirsty beast?

124
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:40,847
Not quite.

125
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:43,083
It's a dodo from Earth.

126
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,521
Earth?

127
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,064
The old hog never looked so good.

128
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:23,775
Yeah. I was hoping I'd get a piece of you before I left.

129
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:28,106
As much as I dislike taking a personal hand in this matter...

130
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,213
you leave me no other choice.

131
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:33,212
Return to your enclosure immediately.

132
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,440
Who's gonna make me?

133
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,779
I'm gonna have to stop saying that.

134
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:23,696
How could I ever think trash like you was worth saving?

135
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,201
I got a cute smile?

136
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:42,567
Sqweek, old buddy, you're about to witness my good deed for this century.

137
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,302
You're gonna let me go?

138
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,767
Funny.

139
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:50,902
Hey, Supes!

140
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:54,936
Hang on!

141
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:43,020
And that's how come I was so late getting back here, Spewgie.

142
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,630
I knew you'd never let me down, Lobo...

143
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,461
despite rumors to the contrary.

144
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,468
But what about Superman and the rest of those creatures?

145
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:05,471
That's the weirdest part.

146
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,598
Me, I'd have let the critters drift, or maybe host a three-year barbecue.

147
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:13,505
<i>Not old Supes. Said he had a place all picked out for them.</i>

148
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,724
<i>I guess that boy's just a sucker for hard-luck cases.</i>
