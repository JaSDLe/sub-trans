1
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,216
Northern region, sector 17-Alpha.

2
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:03,195
Log date 8313-Omega-3. Jor-El speaking.

3
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:06,129
Gathering readings for final subterranean probe.

4
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,290
I hope everything went smoothly, sir.

5
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:45,262
Frostbite, ice monsters. Same old, same old.

6
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,994
<i>Good afternoon, Jor-El.</i>

7
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,939
Brainiac. What an unpleasant surprise.

8
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,938
<i>I'm awaiting your data.</i>

9
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,907
Have you been spying on me with your satellites again?

10
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:00,640
<i>The Planetary Council demands that I analyze your data...</i>

11
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:02,511
<i>as soon as you obtain it.</i>

12
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:06,116
Brainiac, somewhere in all those trillions of file clusters...

13
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,349
there's got to be one that says people don't like to be spied upon.

14
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,920
<i>Then why did they create me?</i>

15
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,858
A question I often ask myself.

16
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,858
Transmission set. It's feeding time.

17
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:23,367
<i>Data received. Ending transmission.</i>

18
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,803
You're welcome. Glutton.

19
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,375
Hey, Kal, what do you have there?

20
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,881
Oh, great.

21
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:39,350
Kal-El was helping me check the solar panels when he discovered a playmate.

22
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,988
I heard you had fun too.

23
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,648
Oh, yes, I encountered a very friendly shoggot.

24
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,318
All in all, I prefer your arms.

25
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,832
We're moving.

26
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,297
What forsaken spot are we going to now?

27
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,493
- Home, Lara. - Home?

28
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,933
That's right.

29
00:04:57,104 --> 00:05:00,074
What, five months in this deep freeze not enough for you?

30
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:04,235
No, it's just that once we're back, you'll start going over the data.

31
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:08,611
I keep thinking, "What if it supports your theory? What then?"

32
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:11,218
We can deal with it. Trust me.

33
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,910
The truth can only help.

34
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,320
Oh, Jor-El. Such a beautiful world, even up here.

35
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,017
It's hard to believe it could all come to an end.

36
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,308
All I can tell you, Lara, is that if he persists...

37
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,041
in predicting the end of the world, it'll be the end, all right.

38
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,708
Of his political and professional career.

39
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,787
But what if he's right, Father?

40
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,547
Try convincing the council.

41
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,056
He hasn't one supporter for his theory.

42
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,888
They even avoid him in the hallways. You know why?

43
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,723
Why is that, Sul-Van?

44
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,731
Because you can never be wrong, Jor-El.

45
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,395
You can never let it go. You have an ego the size of Argos.

46
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,200
I never let my ego get in the way of the facts.

47
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:09,367
Well, let me let you in on a little fact.

48
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:12,707
Unless Brainiac agrees with you, it's all over.

49
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,578
No more expeditions, no more research, no more...

50
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,887
- It's another temblor. - Kal-El!

51
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,642
Hush.

52
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,962
You'd better be wrong, Jor-El.

53
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,565
You'd better be dead wrong.

54
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,039
Each of you should have my report.

55
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:16,143
It distills all the data I've gathered so far and leaves no doubt that...

56
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,906
That the planet's core is undergoing a mounting chain reaction...

57
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,380
that will eventually destroy Krypton!

58
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,041
- Lunacy! - Ask Brainiac!

59
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,881
Yes, Brainiac. He'll tell us.

60
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,751
Silence. Silence. Enough!

61
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:33,486
I presume you've submitted your findings to Brainiac?

62
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,095
Yes.

63
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,424
So, what say you, Brainiac?

64
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,696
<i>One can appreciate Jor-El's hard work. However, he is still mistaken.</i>

65
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,498
<i>As I've stated before...</i>

66
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,768
<i>the temblors are the result of a slight polar shift, no more...</i>

67
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:52,038
<i>- and will soon abate.</i> - He's wrong! He doesn't know!

68
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:57,718
Nonsense! There isn't a square foot of this planet Brainiac doesn't know.

69
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:02,914
He was built to monitor all of Krypton and has, I might add, served us far better...

70
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,390
than upstart scientists with apocalyptic visions.

71
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:11,392
Your faith in him will be the end of us all. Act now and we can save everyone.

72
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:13,727
And how do you propose to do that?

73
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,735
Put everyone in the Phantom Zone.

74
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:26,476
You're asking us to put ourselves among the vilest criminals in the galaxy?

75
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:28,513
You're mad!

76
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,082
We can restore ourselves later, on another planet.

77
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,018
It would only take one man.

78
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,317
Listen to me! I've built a ship!

79
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,551
Listen, please!

80
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:04,143
So, son, how does it feel not to have a worry in the world?

81
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:19,358
- Think we can get the baby to bed early? - I have to go down to Brainiac operations.

82
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,963
No.

83
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:24,037
- Lara, he's lying. - He's a machine.

84
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:27,467
He's still lying. I have to know why.

85
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:30,042
Has it occurred to you that he could be right?

86
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,806
That somewhere you might have made a mistake?

87
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,710
It's no crime to be wrong!

88
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:37,480
Please, Lara.

89
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,949
Go, Jor-El.

90
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,352
Find out once and for all. We've lived like this too long.

91
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:46,051
Your theories are more destructive than you can imagine.

92
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:08,947
<i>Good evening, Jor-El. You've been busy tonight.</i>

93
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,516
<i>May I be of service?</i>

94
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:13,745
Just trying to find out why we disagree, Brainiac.

95
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:16,023
<i>Human error, I'm afraid.</i>

96
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,354
Funny, I didn't think you were afraid of anything.

97
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,860
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

98
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,658
You're denying me access to satellite com.

99
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,528
What's going on in there?

100
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,364
<i>Currently reallocating security file clusters.</i>

101
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:33,269
Well, let's just see if I can override that.

102
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,414
Why do I get the feeling you're trying to hide something?

103
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,157
<i>Access denied.</i>

104
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:52,588
I don't think so.

105
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:57,727
<i>This is a breach of security, Jor-El.</i>

106
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:01,926
<i>A violation of statute 107653...</i>

107
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,937
<i>subsection 4.85.</i>

108
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:10,066
You're downloading. You're transmitting your memory to a satellite.

109
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:12,241
You're saving yourself.

110
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:13,676
<i>I must.</i>

111
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:17,875
<i>After all, am I not the repository of all Kryptonian knowledge?</i>

112
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,521
<i>Should I not be saved above all?</i>

113
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:23,089
You self-righteous monster!

114
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,088
<i>Temper, temper, Jor-El.</i>

115
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,424
<i>If you stop me, there won't even be a memory of Krypton left.</i>

116
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:35,327
<i>All its culture, its wonders and glory, will be dust in the cosmos.</i>

117
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:37,164
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

118
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:39,000
Why did you lie?

119
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:41,472
<i>If the council knew Krypton was doomed...</i>

120
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:45,670
<i>they would frantically put me to work on calculating an evacuation plan.</i>

121
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:49,483
<i>A futile gesture, given the time remaining.</i>

122
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,084
How much time is left?

123
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:56,718
<i>Hours. This world has seen its last sunrise.</i>

124
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:58,753
Hold it right there!

125
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,361
- Jor-El? - We received an alert from Brainiac.

126
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:04,760
- There's an intruder. <i>- He's the intruder. Arrest him.</i>

127
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:14,907
Stop!

128
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:25,482
That's right. Jor-El has just fled Sat Com.

129
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:28,350
<i>- Secure stations. - Be warned, he is armed.</i>

130
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:31,390
<i>Use of deadly force is advised.</i>

131
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,416
He's heading our way!

132
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,919
<i>I know. This time I will handle it.</i>

133
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,610
Great Rao.

134
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:29,949
Where is he?

135
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,278
<i>What did you say?</i>

136
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,211
Jor-El? Where is he?

137
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,217
<i>Level five, north wing.</i>

138
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,887
Down here!

139
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,364
- There he is. - Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

140
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:51,800
He's getting away!

141
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:24,971
Then you've read it?

142
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:28,282
Yes. And as much as I don't want to believe it...

143
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,317
your husband's findings are hard to discount.

144
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,648
Still, there's the Brainiac question.

145
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:38,820
Jor-El! Father's read your report. He thinks he can help.

146
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:42,122
- Yes, I think it's worth it... - It's too late.

147
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,524
- Good Lord. - What happened?

148
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,826
Brainiac tried to kill me. The police will be here soon.

149
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:53,197
Remember when I told you what we'd do if worst came to worse?

150
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:55,707
- No! - I'm sorry.

151
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,868
I never thought it would come to this.

152
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,810
Come to what? What are you talking about?

153
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:03,608
What's this nonsense about Brainiac?

154
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:07,880
Sul-Van, if you love your grandson and care one whit about his future...

155
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,990
you'll kindly shut up!

156
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,203
Sleep, Kal-El, my beautiful child...

157
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:31,044
my heartbeat, my life.

158
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,883
Send Kal-El to another world?

159
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:42,387
- You can't be serious! - The ship will get him there.

160
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,317
I know. I built it. It was part of the plan.

161
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:49,328
Save everyone in the Phantom Zone, travel to Earth, then bring them back.

162
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:53,366
Now it's only good for a lifeboat. And the passenger will be my son...

163
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,504
the last son of Krypton.

164
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,868
Lara!

165
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,544
I'm ready. He's sedated.

166
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:09,741
The police are here. They'll break into the lab to get me.

167
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,580
If I lead them away while you set up the launch...

168
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:14,719
I can't do it all myself.

169
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,518
I'll be back. I promise.

170
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,460
Lara, please, this is madness!

171
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:25,725
Father, I love you dearly, but this is my baby's life.

172
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,068
But he can't outrun the police.

173
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,568
Do you have a better idea?

174
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,074
See him?

175
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:42,546
Not yet. They have the lights off.

176
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,550
Wait! There's movement in the hover port.

177
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:49,223
Look out!

178
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:59,097
I hope his crash bags are working.

179
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,109
Good evening. Is there a problem?

180
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:34,700
I've got the hyperspace coordinates locked in.

181
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:37,361
Once he gets to Earth he'll be safe.

182
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,106
Lara, I could send you with him.

183
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:47,107
There's a risk, but if I have time to recalibrate the course...

184
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:51,376
No, my love. I'm staying with you.

185
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:08,393
The patrol's reporting in. Jor-El's escaped the perimeter.

186
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:12,597
- They're requesting further instructions. <i>- It doesn't matter anymore.</i>

187
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,174
<i>Farewell, Krypton.</i>

188
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,304
- Hey, what's going on? - Where'd he go?

189
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,640
Where's Brainiac?

190
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,191
Not another one.

191
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,760
No. The last one.

192
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,430
Goodbye, Kal-El.
