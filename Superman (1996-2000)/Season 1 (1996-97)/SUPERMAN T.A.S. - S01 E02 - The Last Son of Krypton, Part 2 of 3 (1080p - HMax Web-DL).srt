1
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:15,744
Holy Christmas! What was that?

2
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:31,250
Over here, Martha. Martha?

3
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,649
Martha? Martha?

4
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:57,689
You'll wake him.

5
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,192
Martha, what are you doing?

6
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:04,289
Put that thing back. We don't know where it came from.

7
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,861
He's not a thing, Jonathan. He's a baby. A little baby.

8
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:11,053
Who would put a baby in a spaceship?

9
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,390
That's just my point. Could be Russian.

10
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:16,190
- A sputnik baby. - Oh, really!

11
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,626
Maybe he's one of ours.

12
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,254
- You think NASA's missing a kid? - I don't care where he came from.

13
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:25,196
All I know is, he needs us, Jonathan. Look how he's reaching out to you.

14
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,330
Cute little fella.

15
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,661
Got a good grip too.

16
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:35,862
What do you think of the name Christopher?

17
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:38,697
Now, Martha, let's discuss this.

18
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,361
- Or Kevin? - Martha!

19
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:42,630
Or Kirk?

20
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,295
I know. We can use my maiden name. What do you think of...?

21
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:48,199
Clark!

22
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,103
Clark Kent!

23
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:52,568
Yes, Ms. Stevenson?

24
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,867
Looks like you daydreamed your way to another perfect score.

25
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,100
Once again the boy genius performs to his usual standards.

26
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,004
And so did you, Miss Lang.

27
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:12,671
For a guy who just aced his midterms, you don't look too happy. What's wrong?

28
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:16,172
Oh, I don't know. Lately I'm feeling kind of weird.

29
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,642
You've always been weird, if you ask me.

30
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:24,175
Hey, it's Lana. The girl who's had a crush on you since we were 3.

31
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,146
- You can tell me. - It's just...

32
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:30,148
in the last few months, I've been hearing things.

33
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:33,012
Things I couldn't before. Like over there.

34
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,880
Jenny's telling Pete Ross her folks are out tonight.

35
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,610
That little tart! You heard that?

36
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:41,344
And I can see things too, like in the gym.

37
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,786
Ms. Stevenson's putting up decorations for the dance.

38
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,650
Someone should hold that ladder.

39
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,087
You're saying you can see through walls?

40
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:56,953
So how many times have you peeked into the girls' locker room?

41
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,784
- Lana! - I'm just kidding. Jeez!

42
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,222
It's not a joke, Lana. I'm going through a bad time.

43
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,657
I thought if anybody'd understand, it'd be...

44
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,294
- Listen! - What is it?

45
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:19,453
Call an ambulance! There's gonna be an accident!

46
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,121
How do you know? Clark!

47
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,900
Hey, stop!

48
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:04,643
- Mommy! - Annie!

49
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,637
Help me! Mom and Daddy!

50
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:15,406
Oh, my God! Clark! Clark!

51
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,382
Mommy!

52
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,515
Annie!

53
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:32,080
You're not even burned. How...?

54
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,315
I don't know.

55
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:40,079
Getting stronger every day, Pa.

56
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:41,977
Hello?

57
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,553
And that's not the half of it. Look.

58
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:49,582
It's getting hot.

59
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,186
- All you did was look at it. - I know.

60
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:53,789
Yes, dear, I'll tell him.

61
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:56,754
That was Lana. Third time tonight, Clark.

62
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,324
Won't you talk to her?

63
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:01,755
What can I say, Ma? I don't even know how it happened.

64
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:05,190
Suddenly I was running faster than I've ever run in my life.

65
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,021
I ripped the camper apart like cardboard. The fire never touched me.

66
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:12,593
I always felt different, even before you told me I was adopted...

67
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,821
but how is it possible to do this?

68
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:17,361
I think it's time, Martha.

69
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,267
We never showed you this, son.

70
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:30,026
I guess we didn't know how to explain it.

71
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,826
Still don't.

72
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:38,927
You know how some babies are found in baskets?

73
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:41,499
Well, this is how we found you.

74
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,829
You're kidding, right?

75
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:47,266
You're not.

76
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,270
- So where did I come from? - We don't know.

77
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:54,904
There wasn't much inside, just some blankets and this.

78
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:58,940
Never could get the darn thing open. Maybe you've got the magic touch.

79
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,176
What's happening?

80
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,076
- Kal-El? - Who?

81
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:27,080
Hello, son. You've activated the message we placed in your escape rocket.

82
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,149
- I am Jor-El. - And I am Lara.

83
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:31,716
We are your parents.

84
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,220
By the time you see this, our world will have been gone for many years.

85
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,786
You are the sole survivor of Krypton...

86
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:49,946
a planet similar to Earth in many ways. This was our home.

87
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:52,419
No. No, it can't be true.

88
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,113
- It's hurting him. - Let him be, Martha.

89
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,724
You may have discovered that you are much stronger and faster...

90
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,415
than a normal human being.

91
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,218
I am a normal human being!

92
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:05,723
Your Kryptonian body draws its strength from Earth's yellow sun.

93
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,554
It will give you abilities that no other human has.

94
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,194
I don't believe any of this.

95
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:14,295
Some people will fear you, perhaps even try to destroy you.

96
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:17,987
Despite this, you must never use your powers in anger.

97
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,460
Be brave, my son.

98
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,962
Remember who you are and the legacy you carry inside you.

99
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,564
We love you, Kal-El. Always.

100
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,066
It's not true.

101
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,230
I'm not a freak. I'm not.

102
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:42,370
I'm not!

103
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:43,799
Clark!

104
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,904
Clark, come back!

105
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:46,376
Yes!

106
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,562
Oh, yeah!

107
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:22,024
Ma! Pa!

108
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,591
Oh, Clark!

109
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,366
It's okay.

110
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,871
<i>Metropolis can boast of many amazing sights..</i>

111
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:53,528
<i>The country's biggest bridge. The world's tallest building.</i>

112
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:58,363
<i>But now it may have its most astonishing sight: a guardian angel.</i>

113
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,871
<i>Just ask little Danitra Evans. She saw him.</i>

114
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:06,100
<i>I was fooling around the window when I lost my balance and fell.</i>

115
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:11,006
<i>Suddenly this big blue angel with red wings came down and caught me.</i>

116
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,872
<i>He put me on the ground and flew away.</i>

117
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:16,638
<i>You should've heard my mommy scream.</i>

118
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:22,042
<i>This is where they found Danitra, and that's where she fell from.</i>

119
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:27,879
<i>Thirty floors up. If it wasn't an angel that saved her, what was it?</i>

120
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,606
Friendly pigeons.

121
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,011
What's the matter? Don't believe in angels?

122
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:36,015
It's TV, boys, just a trumped-up story to boost ratings.

123
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:38,014
And maybe sell some papers?

124
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:44,142
Chief, I spent a week on the docks with rats and frizzed hair...

125
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,287
exposing the biggest gun-smuggling ring in 10 years...

126
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,182
and what makes the front page?

127
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:53,152
Some sprouty, New Age, granola-crunching fluff piece on angels.

128
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:57,620
- What's next? Interviews with Bigfoot? - Good timing, Lois.

129
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,622
I want you to be the first to know I'm hiring a new guy on the city desk.

130
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,520
Is he cute?

131
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:06,784
- You tell me. - Oh, hi.

132
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,456
- Hello. - This is the guy, Lois.

133
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:14,288
- Clark Kent from Smallville. - Smallville? Never heard of it.

134
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,122
- Have you ever been to Kansas? - God, no.

135
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,353
I've been reading his stuff. It's good.

136
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,463
I thought maybe he could tag along with you to get the lay of the land.

137
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,792
I'd love to play den mother, but I got that Lexcorp story in half an hour.

138
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:31,694
Oh, yeah. The great and benevolent Mr. Luthor...

139
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:34,595
is demonstrating a new weapons system today.

140
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,496
Lex is Lois' beat, but I'm sure she won't mind...

141
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,192
having another set of eyes with her. Right, Lois?

142
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:47,028
Smallville, nothing against you, but even as a kid I never liked babysitting.

143
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,830
You wanna keep up, be quick.

144
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:53,200
- I'm no tour guide and I don't hold hands. - You won't have to worry about that.

145
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:55,999
Jimmy. Jimmy Olsen, say hello to Clark Kent.

146
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,639
- The new guy? - Yeah.

147
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:59,273
Nice to meet you. I'm Jimmy.

148
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,771
I work as a copy boy, but I'm a photographer.

149
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,033
- Good for you. - I'd like to show you my pictures.

150
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,005
- Well, not right... - They're hot, Mr. Kent, really.

151
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:11,701
I'm fearless. You can ask Miss Lane. She uses me all the time.

152
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,873
Bye.

153
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:16,735
So I see.

154
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,678
You sure my nose isn't shiny?

155
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,841
Angela, don't tell me you're actually covering real news.

156
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,645
What happened? Run out of alien abductees?

157
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,945
At least my network doesn't have to send two reporters...

158
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,484
to cover the same story.

159
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:51,755
You'll have to introduce us sometime.

160
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:54,684
- Thanks for the quote. - How did you get here so fast?

161
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,413
Oh, I just flew.

162
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,614
- What'd you get? - A shared byline, if you use it.

163
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,350
I apologize. You're not the rube hayseed I took you for.

164
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:06,355
Thanks. I think.

165
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,425
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the press...</i>

166
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:13,253
at this time we invite everyone into the main hall for our special presentation.

167
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:17,486
The long-awaited debut of the next word in military defense:

168
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,993
<i>The Lexoskel 5000.</i>

169
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:34,399
<i>Constructed from a patented alloy, the Lexo suit is virtually indestructible.</i>

170
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,693
<i>As seen in this footage against these automated tanks...</i>

171
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,364
<i>the Lexo suit stands up to heavy punishment...</i>

172
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:49,701
<i>and returns it in kind.</i>

173
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,972
<i>Guiding this suit is a single soldier...</i>

174
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,834
<i>made more powerful than an entire battalion.</i>

175
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:09,409
And now, here's to the future, and the man who's created it, Lex Luthor.

176
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:18,177
Bet you this beats the dog-and-pony shows back home.

177
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,308
Time to crash the party, gentlemen.

178
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:38,483
Excuse me.

179
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,480
I'd like to say that I view the Lexo suit...

180
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:46,382
not as an instrument of war, but as an instrument to end war.

181
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:47,466
No way.

182
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,100
- It's him! - The guy with the cape!

183
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:14,375
Gentlemen, believe it or not, we are being tailed at 6 o'clock.

184
00:18:56,888 --> 00:19:01,255
I don't know who he is or what he is, but he's all yours.

185
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,484
I've got him.

186
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:09,750
He's dust.
