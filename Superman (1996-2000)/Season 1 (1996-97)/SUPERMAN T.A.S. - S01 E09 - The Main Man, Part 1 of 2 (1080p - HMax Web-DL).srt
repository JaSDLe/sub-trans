1
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,581
Get ready. Now.

2
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,707
The readings are off the scale.

3
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,381
No sign of it.

4
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:56,715
Professor, he's coming back.

5
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:14,641
Congratulations, professor.

6
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:18,472
Your team did a fantastic job refitting this vehicle for space travel.

7
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:21,285
It's hard to believe it's the same rocket that brought me to Earth.

8
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:22,976
It was our honor, Superman.

9
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,143
To study a vehicle like this is any scientist's dream.

10
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,652
Where did you say you kept it all these years?

11
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:31,621
- I didn't. - Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

12
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:35,160
I can't help wondering about the civilizations on other worlds.

13
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,321
Their great achievements, their brilliant minds.

14
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:45,802
I'm giving you geeks 10 seconds before I frag everything in sight.

15
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:47,502
One, 10.

16
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,515
Not you, Sqweek.

17
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,053
Hey, Lobo...

18
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,918
long time no see.

19
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:11,396
Emperor Spewge knows it was you what pilfered his treasury, Sqweek.

20
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:15,024
He's paying me to bring the dough back in a nice little pile.

21
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,462
- What about me? - Same deal.

22
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,533
Framed. I was framed.

23
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:22,603
Is that so?

24
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,205
No, no. Help!

25
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:31,979
Hey, leave my little brother alone.

26
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:37,149
Well, if it ain't Gnaww Vermin and his roach-motel rejects.

27
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:39,816
Don't tell me you're after this bounty too.

28
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:43,155
If anyone's gonna collect on Sqweek, it's gonna be family.

29
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,890
- Hand him over. - Sure.

30
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:52,070
I was hoping I'd see some excitement on this job.

31
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,601
Guess not.

32
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:16,024
Hold on, Sqweek.

33
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,500
Lobo.

34
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,202
Hey, wait.

35
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:42,813
Old weasel spit.

36
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,816
Too bad I can't stick around.

37
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,112
Now I'm mad.

38
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:18,224
Now I'm really mad.

39
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:25,197
It's always sweeter collecting a reward knowing you beat some other geek out of it.

40
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:29,198
<i>- The bounty hunter has entered range.</i> - Proceed.

41
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,674
Holy fragarolli.

42
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:40,439
Feels like I'm being torn apart.

43
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,076
Cool.

44
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:53,324
Oh, yeah. Someone is definitely tired of breathing.

45
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,219
Show yourself, you slimy geek-wad.

46
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,231
I am the Preserver.

47
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,370
And I'm the night manager at the Hotel d'Frag.

48
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,562
Lookie there, it's checkout time.

49
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,965
Fragging gizzards.

50
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:13,973
You are Lobo. Assassin, brigand, sociopath, monster.

51
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:16,973
You left out "scourge of the cosmos."

52
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,849
And the most ruthless bounty hunter in the galaxy.

53
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,579
I want to hire you.

54
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,625
Sorry, dude. I'm already on a job.

55
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,459
Your prisoner will be held until you return.

56
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:36,501
Besides, this job should be no great task to one with your skills.

57
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:42,007
Behold. Gathered here are the rarest creatures in the universe...

58
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,636
each the last survivor of its race.

59
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:49,182
So you got a thing for varmints, so what?

60
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:53,810
Many years ago, the planet Krypton was destroyed.

61
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:58,152
I had long believed all members of the Kryptonian race were extinct.

62
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:03,460
Until I found evidence of one living on a distant world called Earth.

63
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,958
Looks like a first-class wimp to me.

64
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,494
He is more than he appears.

65
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:11,029
Sluggo, I got better ways to waste my time

66
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,470
than rounding up bugs for your flea circus.

67
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,575
So if you'll hand over the runt...

68
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:17,897
I'll cancel the homemade colostomy I'm

69
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,476
planning to inflict on your tiny, wrinkled...

70
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:23,139
Oh, mama.

71
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:26,478
That's a lot of mai tais.

72
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:32,352
You deliver the last Kryptonian, and the jewels are yours.

73
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,221
Do we have a bargain?

74
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,055
Hose down a cage, boss.

75
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:39,199
You're getting a new monkey.

76
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:47,237
<i>Remember those blurry photos of UFOs that looked like garbage pail lids</i>?

77
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:51,138
<i>Well, we finally got one that's as clear as it is confusing.</i>

78
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:56,309
After careful analysis, experts agree it's a scroungy biker on a flying motorcycle.

79
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,780
Yeah, right.

80
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,752
Hey, how's it going, chief?

81
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,151
Maybe you can help me. I'm new in town...

82
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,655
and I'm looking to find this geek here.

83
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:10,730
Superman? We don't keep tabs on him. He only shows up if there's trouble.

84
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,922
I can do trouble.

85
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,637
I'm confused, Kent.

86
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:25,403
I've lived in Metropolis most of my life. I don't know how some yokel...

87
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:28,480
from Smallville is getting every hot story in town.

88
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,882
Well, Lois, the truth is I'm actually Superman in disguise...

89
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:36,887
I pretend to be a journalist to hear about disasters as they happen...

90
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:40,652
- and then squeeze you out of the byline. - You're a sick man, Kent.

91
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:43,486
You asked.

92
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,073
Yeah, Lane.

93
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:58,973
What? I'll be right there.

94
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:03,381
Some lunatic's just opened fire on the midtown...

95
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,983
police station.

96
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,977
Oh, no you don't, Kent. Not this time.

97
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:22,492
This is getting lame. I thought he'd be here by now.

98
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:23,897
Mosquito.

99
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,910
Time to up the ante, I'm thinking.

100
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:51,922
Finally. I've been trying to get in touch with you all day.

101
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:54,532
- Who are you? - I'm sorry.

102
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,225
My card.

103
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:00,398
The name's Lobo.

104
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:03,771
That's I as in "lacerate," O as in "obliterate"...

105
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:06,412
B as in "disembowel," and O as in...

106
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,077
I guess I can use "obliterate" twice. What do you think?

107
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,480
I think you're a certifiable madman.

108
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:17,484
Thanks.

109
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:28,930
Superman, roll clear!

110
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:37,537
Gas?

111
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,277
Now you ankle suckers are playing dirty.

112
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:42,042
I'm losing it.

113
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,980
Going under.

114
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,280
Stay back.

115
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:49,354
- What is it? - I don't know.

116
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,791
I've never seen a creature like this.

117
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:53,754
I love you too.

118
00:10:56,428 --> 00:11:00,627
First rule of hunting, Superdude. Make the target come to you.

119
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,594
Good advice.

120
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:34,225
Hey, no riders.

121
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:40,696
Stop here, driver. There they are.

122
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:45,201
I don't believe it.

123
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:59,523
Believe me, Mr. President. You have my word that my new weapon system will...

124
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,161
What the devil?

125
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,663
- Look out. - Look out.

126
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:44,097
Look out.

127
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:53,605
Dang, man. I gotta say, I am impressed.

128
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,307
I saw you go for the rocket, I couldn't figure what you were doing.

129
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,141
Then it hit me. You didn't want no one hurt...

130
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,720
even if you took the fragging yourself.

131
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,823
You actually care about them geeks.

132
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,152
They're human beings.

133
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:09,795
Yeah, well, they're gonna have to make do...

134
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:12,557
without their big blue babysitter from now on.

135
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,190
See, someone's paying me a heap of cash for your carcass...

136
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:20,203
and the Main Man always delivers.

137
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,934
Now the more you move, the worse it'll hurt...

138
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:28,935
so feel free to go crazy.

139
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,369
Excuse me?

140
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:34,372
Leave him alone. Go on, get out of here.

141
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:37,040
Well, little lady...

142
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,609
hello.

143
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,545
Lois, stay back.

144
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:43,614
Pipe down, junior.

145
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:49,054
Lois, huh? Guess that means you know this loser, right, honey buns?

146
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,387
You his girlfriend or something?

147
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,529
Drop dead.

148
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:08,743
Of course, any babe with class would rather be hanging with the Main Man.

149
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:12,340
Why don't you show old Lobo how classy you are?

150
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:13,744
You pig.

151
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,245
I like a babe who plays rough.

152
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,580
Come on, let me have another. Right here. Right...

153
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:23,149
You dirty frigging, back-fragging, son of a...

154
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,295
Get maintenance teams on every floor.

155
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:29,159
Put them on round the clock if you have to. I want repairs completed...

156
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,359
- Kill, Main, frag, destroy. - Immediately.

157
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,635
- Are you all right? - Are you all right?

158
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,366
- I'm fine. - I'm fine. Gotta go.

159
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,373
Give him one for me. Make it a dozen.

160
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:47,778
Last call?

161
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,513
Already?

162
00:14:58,661 --> 00:14:59,890
Get up.

163
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,597
I said, get up.

164
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:04,662
You ain't half the boy scout you're cracked up to be.

165
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,768
Looks like I'm in for a real fight.

166
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:17,213
Think I'll take five until I'm ready to resume kicking...

167
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,011
the collective butts of you and everyone else on this dung heap. Ciao!

168
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:35,162
<i>You've never tested the vehicle in deep space before...</i>

169
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,323
<i>let alone under combat conditions.</i>

170
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,470
I can't risk that maniac coming back to Earth, professor.

171
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:43,606
I've got one chance to drive him away, and I'm taking it.

172
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,809
Sensors have picked up his bike's ion trail.

173
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:51,706
He's close. But I can't get a definite fix.

174
00:15:57,586 --> 00:16:00,249
- Lobo calling. - Hi there.

175
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:22,134
Okay, frag-face, let's tango.

176
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:03,284
I guess the only way to reason with you is to take away your toy.

177
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,683
Hands off my hog.

178
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:15,164
<i>Lobo has lured the Kryptonian into range.</i>

179
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:18,165
Excellent. Fire when ready.

180
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:29,301
Lights out, Clyde.

181
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:37,514
This can't be.

182
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,116
Krypton?

183
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,554
No, but an incredible simulation.

184
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:48,523
Let me guess. You're the one who hired Lobo to get me.

185
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:52,828
I do what I must to preserve species threatened with extinction.

186
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:55,062
You are the last Kryptonian.

187
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,638
Therefore, your place is here.

188
00:17:57,806 --> 00:17:59,900
I think not!

189
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:02,167
Like Krypton's red sun...

190
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:07,746
this light cancels the unnatural abilities given to you by the yellow sun of Earth.

191
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,110
I always strive for complete accuracy.

192
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,413
Swell.

193
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,931
Hey, monkey, want a banana?

194
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:27,099
When I get out, I'm shoving that arrogant smirk right down your throat.

195
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,498
Oh, yeah.

196
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:32,397
You know, I believe that Lois gal might be getting a tad lonely...

197
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,044
now that you're doing time in a cosmic petting zoo.

198
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,441
Maybe I'll go back and cheer her up.

199
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:43,182
Of course, I do have to collect the bounty on this geek first.

200
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:45,548
Emperor Spewge got a bad temper on him.

201
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:50,125
Adios, wrinkles. You want any more rare dorks snagged, you got my number.

202
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:54,855
Actually, there is one other being I need for my collection:

203
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,896
The last Zarnian.

204
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,866
That's rich. I'm the last Zarnian.

205
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:03,631
I fragged the rest of the planet for my high school science project.

206
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,069
Gave myself an A.

207
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,545
You ugly, two-timing...

208
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:19,382
big fragger. You...

209
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,553
just carved your own headstone.

210
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:27,225
Nobody... double-crosses the Main Man.

211
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:29,231
Nobody.
