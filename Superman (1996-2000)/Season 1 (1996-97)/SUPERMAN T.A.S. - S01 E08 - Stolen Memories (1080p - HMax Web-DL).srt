1
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:21,754
Move that generator. Bring up number seven.

2
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:27,888
There. It just entered the atmosphere.

3
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:30,925
ETA: Two minutes, 27 seconds.

4
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,232
You're late. Secure the lights on the north ridge.

5
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,963
- All right, people, let's move out. - Okay.

6
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:41,302
All right, let's go!

7
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,309
So far, so good. But what's the story here?

8
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm not sure, Jimmy.

9
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:49,780
Except that Luthor's supposed to be meeting someone. Someone important.

10
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,301
Forty-three seconds and counting, Mr. Luthor.

11
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,099
Excellent.

12
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:18,434
Hey. What's going on?

13
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:27,116
Weird. Hey.

14
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:30,388
Well, where is it?

15
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,053
- There it is. - Oh, God.

16
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,070
Jimmy, the camera.

17
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:44,670
Oh, right.

18
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:51,568
Welcome to Earth.

19
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:55,739
I'm Lex Luthor, the one who intercepted your transmissions.

20
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,182
I am pleased to make contact with you, Lex Luthor.

21
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:00,843
I am called Brainiac.

22
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,521
I presume you speak for your planet.

23
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,018
For all intents and purposes.

24
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:10,056
In any event, I know what you want, and as a show of my friendship...

25
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,533
I offer you this, a disc containing basic information about Earth and its history.

26
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,929
A kind of planetary primer.

27
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,706
Hey, where'd the green guy go?

28
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:24,772
Show's not over yet.

29
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,299
Superman to STAR Labs. Can you read me?

30
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,094
I've returned from hyperspace.

31
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:51,363
<i>- How far this time?</i> - Five and a half light years.

32
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,367
<i>Just past Alpha Centauri.</i>

33
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,941
In less than four hours. Remarkable.

34
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,907
<i>Shall we try for the Vega system?</i>

35
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:00,411
Actually, I think we should postpone for now.

36
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,549
The Pentagon would like a word with you.

37
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:06,115
- About what? <i>- Your old nemesis, Lex Luthor.</i>

38
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,619
<i>It appears he's made a friend.</i>

39
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,026
So, Mr. Luthor.

40
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,666
How long did you intend to keep your rendezvous a secret?

41
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:23,403
If you haven't heard, there's a thing known as national security.

42
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:27,230
There's also a thing known as free enterprise.

43
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,635
It was LexCorp that scanned the heavens, It was LexCorp that made contact...

44
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:34,247
and it will be LexCorp that reaps the benefits.

45
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,312
At what cost? What do we know about this alien?

46
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,544
Brainiac is a collector of data.

47
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,813
In exchange for information about us...

48
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,822
he is willing to share his knowledge of the universe.

49
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:46,717
Allow me to demonstrate.

50
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,096
Hey, what is this?

51
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:54,660
This is just a sample of his technology.

52
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,565
Who knows what else he has.

53
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:59,331
A cure for cancer? A way to repair the ozone?

54
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,665
Are you going to turn your backs on that?

55
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,443
Get me down from here. Luthor!

56
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,854
Perhaps if we could meet this Brainiac, face to face...?

57
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,856
That could prove difficult. However, I have a suggestion.

58
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:22,189
Let Superman talk with him, alien to alien.

59
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,194
He can confirm what I'm telling you.

60
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:27,296
- Why me? - Because I told him all about you.

61
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:31,168
And he's most anxious to meet our Man of Steel.

62
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:49,081
Came a long way to get stood up.

63
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:17,678
Kryptonian.

64
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:27,555
Nice shot.

65
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,966
I should've known Luthor was setting me up.

66
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:14,454
Who else wants a piece?

67
00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:33,845
I'm waiting.

68
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,755
Most impressive.

69
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,985
Your powers even exceed Luthor's description.

70
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:46,087
Brainiac, I presume.

71
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,592
I apologize for any discomfort...

72
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:51,997
but it was important that I accurately gauge your powers.

73
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:58,333
- Why? Morbid curiosity? - Curiosity, yes. Morbid, hardly.

74
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,502
You see, we have more in common than you can possibly know, Kal-El.

75
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,409
How do you know my name?

76
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:08,183
- Have you been to Krypton? - I am Krypton.

77
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:17,194
We are both orphans of the same planet.

78
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:21,864
While you've been living here on Earth, I have roamed the universe.

79
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:25,093
These orbs contain all the knowledge I've collected.

80
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:29,639
Each represents all the recorded information from a single planet.

81
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,404
Incredible.

82
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:36,113
And Krypton?

83
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,819
All that was Krypton is contained within this orb.

84
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,420
Go ahead.

85
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,160
Touch your legacy.

86
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,906
- Kal-El. - Father.

87
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,308
Enough.

88
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:20,051
I saw my father. Did you know him?

89
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:24,422
Yes. He helped me escape Krypton's fate too.

90
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:28,929
Now all of our home world's memories are stored within me.

91
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,159
You mean you're an artificial intelligence...

92
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:34,169
and those orbs are some kind of memory modules.

93
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:36,734
Most perceptive.

94
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:47,414
In all my travels, I have never encountered another quite like you.

95
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:51,688
We would make a formidable pair, we twin sons of Krypton.

96
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:53,518
Join me, Kal-El.

97
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,421
Help me explore the galaxies and collect knowledge...

98
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,387
and I will give you memories of Krypton.

99
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:02,426
You will know your world as if you lived there yourself.

100
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,098
But Earth is my home now.

101
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:09,103
Powers such as yours should not be confined to a single infinitesimal dot.

102
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:10,570
Consider my offer.

103
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:12,872
In exchange for this world...

104
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:16,309
I am offering you the universe.

105
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:20,047
<i>Though little is still known of our visitor from the stars...</i>

106
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:23,619
<i>all of Metropolis is maniac for Brainiac.</i>

107
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:27,315
<i>Even Superman thinks he's for real.</i>

108
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,060
The universe.

109
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:36,564
Is it really possible?

110
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,088
Mother?

111
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:10,760
Krypton is undergoing a chain reaction which will destroy the planet.

112
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:12,425
<i>Jor-El is mistaken.</i>

113
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:16,703
He's wrong. Your faith in Brainiac will be the end of us all.

114
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:21,277
You're downloading. You're saving yourself.

115
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:22,674
Arrest him.

116
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:41,288
Farewell, Krypton.

117
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:11,841
How much longer?

118
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,276
We should be online in 20 minutes, Mr. Luthor.

119
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,209
- Make it 10. - Luthor, we have to talk.

120
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,375
I have reservations about Brainiac.

121
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,147
Really. Well, you're a little late.

122
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:25,156
I'm already preparing a hookup with Brainiac's ship...

123
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:28,818
so he can feed his memory directly into LexCorp's mainframe.

124
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:30,591
I wouldn't.

125
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm listening.

126
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,562
It was several hours after I touched the orb that I saw the images.

127
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,833
It's too soon to trust him completely.

128
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,735
I never trust anyone completely.

129
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:51,416
Since Brainiac arrived, I've had him targeted from land-based platforms...

130
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,076
with a payload of six and a half megatons.

131
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,247
Enough firepower to incinerate Metropolis County.

132
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,949
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

133
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:04,496
Precisely. Although in your case, I'll make an exception.

134
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,607
Kal-El, have you considered my offer?

135
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,334
I still have a few questions.

136
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,173
Of course, I calculated that you would.

137
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,344
The linkup is complete, Brainiac. LexCorp's system is online.

138
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:32,424
Please excuse me while I deal with this transaction.

139
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:57,882
Ready to transmit data.

140
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,386
The linkup's working, Mr. Luthor.

141
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,625
Begin downloading now.

142
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,898
Brainiac.

143
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:25,429
- Mr. Luthor, something's wrong. - What is it?

144
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,998
Brainiac's overriding our transfer protocols.

145
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,202
We're not controlling this thing anymore.

146
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,607
He's changed the OS. He put up a firewall.

147
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,873
- We're locked out. - Pull the plug now.

148
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,108
Won't help, reserve batteries will kick in.

149
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,888
If he gets control of my systems, he can access any defense computer on the planet.

150
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:44,286
We'll be sitting ducks. Fire the missiles.

151
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:49,555
- He's shut down the lines. - We're stranded.

152
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:59,137
You destroyed those planets, didn't you? And every living soul on them.

153
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,135
Only their knowledge was important.

154
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:06,370
It was what I was programmed to collect and protect.

155
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:07,673
But why kill?

156
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,509
The fewer beings who have the knowledge, the more precious it becomes.

157
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,914
You're insane.

158
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,588
- We've regained control. - Take Brainiac off-line permanently.

159
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,743
You are your father's son, Kal-El. Headstrong, foolish, easily defeated...

160
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:48,706
and ultimately forgotten.

161
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,138
The orbs.

162
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:23,234
It'll take years to rebuild these systems.

163
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,569

00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:47,833
