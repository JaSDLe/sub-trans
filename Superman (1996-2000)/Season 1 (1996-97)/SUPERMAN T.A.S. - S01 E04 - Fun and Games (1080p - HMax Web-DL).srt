1
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:03,940
Yeah, we lost them at Third and Shuster.

2
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:06,744
They were heading for the warehouse district.

3
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,953
- Yeah. - Put her there.

4
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,319
- All right. - Nice going.

5
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,188
We scored bigtime.

6
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,794
Hello, boys.

7
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,266
Who's that?

8
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:33,239
I'm ever so sorry to spoil your nice celebration...

9
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:37,712
but I have a very important message for your boss, Mr. Mannheim.

10
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:41,910
Please tell him the Toyman is calling time-out on his little games...

11
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,749
and don't be tardy.

12
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:51,420
Grab Pinocchio before he gets out.

13
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:54,929
Hey, come here. Come back here.

14
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,611
Johnny.

15
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:20,185
- Let's get out of here. - We can't, Spider, it's locked.

16
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,325
Get back in the car.

17
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:48,542
- When's it gonna stop? - Don't worry. These walls are solid steel.

18
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,714
We're gonna die.

19
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,197
<i>- Somebody, help!</i> - Help!

20
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,696
<i>- Help! Get help. - We're gonna get greased.</i>

21
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:31,428
Hey, it stopped.

22
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,325
We're safe.

23
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,657
- Hey, watch it. - What's going on?

24
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:04,925
It was... It was Toyman.

25
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,254
Calling time-out.

26
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,758
Tell Bruno, the Toyman.

27
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,403
What a smashup.

28
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,039
Odd thing. I heard it was parked at the time.

29
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:16,936
Where, at a monster truck rally?

30
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,607
Look on the bright side. At least you look good in silver.

31
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,943
Miss Lane, excuse me if I don't shake hands.

32
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,811
So, what's the lowdown on this Toyman character?

33
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,716
I hear he's got it in for your boss, Bruno Mannheim.

34
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:35,083
What boss? I happen to be a independent agent.

35
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,957
You're wasting your time, doll face. I'll see you in two to five.

36
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,064
Where to now, Miss Lane, the Planet?

37
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:44,063
Actually, I was thinking about a picnic in the park.

38
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:51,608
Testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three.

39
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,909
Is this on? And it is my honor to dedicate Mannheim Park...

40
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:01,018
to the true heroes of Metropolis, our children.

41
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:03,347
Sounds good, Mr. Mannheim.

42
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,318
Enjoying a leisurely afternoon...

43
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:08,357
or have you been listening to the police band again?

44
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,518
Perry assigned me the park opening. Why, what's up?

45
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:13,926
- You haven't heard about the Toyman? - Who?

46
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,296
Nice try, Smallville, but this one's mine.

47
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,161
Mr. Mannheim, Lois Lane, Daily Planet.

48
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,103
Any comments on this morning's armored-car hijacking?

49
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:28,144
Why would I have a comment? I'm a legitimate businessman.

50
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:32,815
Of course. And you have no knowledge of someone calling himself the Toyman?

51
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:35,316
I have no idea what you're talking about.

52
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:41,118
I'm a respected citizen, and I don't appreciate your little insinuations.

53
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,320
Look out!

54
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:09,686
I see a page-one photo.

55
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,986
Look out! They're coming back.

56
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:28,243
They're heading this way.

57
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:30,005
Wait.

58
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,642
You wanna get killed too?

59
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,750
What happened?

60
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:23,124
Looks like it just broke apart.

61
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,793
Get me out of here.

62
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,136
Read it and weep, Kent. It's all here.

63
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,076
The attacks on the armored car and Mannheim, and as a finishing touch...

64
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:39,274
a preliminary profile on the perp by a noted police psychiatrist.

65
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,443
- Based on what? - He uses toys as weapons.

66
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,920
We're talking about a guy with very serious issues.

67
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,217
Like the shrink says:

68
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:51,294
"An emotionally stunted amoral narcissist with paranoid delusions..."

69
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:57,529
"Desperately seeking external validation through antisocial behavior."

70
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:06,342
That creep made me into a laughingstock. How could you let him get so close?

71
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,002
You wouldn't let us in the park, boss, remember?

72
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,342
You was afraid we'd scare the kids.

73
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:14,346
He's out there somewhere, the slimy, little weasel.

74
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:16,851
Thinks he's gonna make me pay.

75
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,216
What?

76
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,041
What are you waiting for? Shoot it.

77
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,043
- It's a big ducky. - Shoot it!

78
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,725
Get out of here.

79
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,118
How does the saying go?

80
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:06,287
"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble."

81
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:10,526
Yeah, it's you, Winslow. Same creepy voice.

82
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:16,572
I don't know how you came back from the dead, but it's gonna be a short visit.

83
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:28,108
<i>Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.</i>

84
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,761
Yeah. Mannheim's still missing, chief.

85
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:19,430
Dinner's here, bye.

86
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,826
Let it be flowers, please.

87
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:51,060
<i>Hello, I'm Princess Nighty-Night.</i>

88
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,708
<i>Nighty-night.</i>

89
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:16,290
Oh, Miss Lane?

90
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,627
Oh, Miss Lane?

91
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,091
Oh, Miss Lane?

92
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,075
Can you come out and play?

93
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,717
Still haven't heard from her?

94
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:56,324
- You think something's wrong? - I don't know.

95
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,722
First Mannheim's missing, now Lois.

96
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:02,728
If I only knew what the link was between Mannheim and Toyman.

97
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,991
You can cross-index with this system...

98
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,136
like "Mannheim" and "Toyman." Mind if I take a shot?

99
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:12,968
I'm so glad you decided to stay, Miss Lane. We're going to have a whole lot of fun.

100
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:14,803
Why me, Toyman?

101
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:18,469
Because of those lies you wrote about me in your little paper.

102
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:21,410
This time, I want you to get it right.

103
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:28,382
- Nothing yet. - Try "Mannheim" with just "toy."

104
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,694
Toymaker Sentenced to Ten Years.

105
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,358
Hey, look at this.

106
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,095
"Toymaker sentenced to 10 years."

107
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,607
It's a very sad story, one most people have forgotten.

108
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:47,969
Once upon a time...

109
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:51,601
there was a kindly man who loved nothing more than making toys.

110
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:56,274
He wanted to build the most wonderful toy factory in all the world.

111
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,750
Only he had no money to pay for it.

112
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,788
Then one day, a man came along.

113
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,618
A very bad man.

114
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,956
He offered to pay for the factory under one condition.

115
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,560
"The factory became a numbers racket front.

116
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:14,032
Bruno Mannheim was named as a suspect, but was never indicted.

117
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:17,172
Only the toymaker, Winslow Schott, was convicted."

118
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:20,399
Sounds like Bruno played him for a patsy.

119
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,240
The bad man watched and laughed...

120
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:28,440
while the police locked the kindly toymaker in the dungeon forever.

121
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:31,586
2-1, Schott's our Toyman.

122
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:35,087
I don't think so, Clark. Take a look.

123
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,151
- His obituary. - Poor guy. He died before making parole.

124
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:42,695
Yeah, but he had a survivor.

125
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:46,365
That's right, Miss Lane. The toymaker had a son.

126
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,331
But without his father...

127
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:52,804
the poor little boy was bounced from foster home to foster home...

128
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:55,375
like a little toy that nobody wanted.

129
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,911
A childhood is a terrible thing to lose, Miss Lane.

130
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:01,742
But I'm getting mine back.

131
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,077
With a vengeance.

132
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,825
Now the real fun begins.

133
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,430
You're going to play...

134
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:18,594
reporter.

135
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,292
This time, I want you to take good notes.

136
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:39,882
You just made the biggest mistake of your life, you miserable little freak.

137
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,888
I mean it, Schott. I got friends.

138
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,219
They'll find you.

139
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,125
On the other hand, maybe we can make a deal.

140
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:57,137
- No peeking now. - Please, don't.

141
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,902
- You can't be serious. - Deadly serious, Miss Lane.

142
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:06,241
Playtime is over. Ready.

143
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:10,842
Aim.

144
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,249
Hey.

145
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:27,333
You broke my toys.

146
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,429
You spoiled my fun.

147
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,440
Little boys shouldn't play with sharp objects.

148
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:41,447
Who invited you, Superman?

149
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,849
Superman? Superman, is that you?

150
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,616
Don't think I haven't prepared a surprise for you.

151
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:51,856
Here's something you can't break.

152
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:55,554
Very funny, Toyman.

153
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,393
Maybe you should read the warning.

154
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:02,901
Dopey Doh is a lethal biogenic organism.

155
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:06,170
Contact with the skin can prove fatal.

156
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,742
It won't stop growing until it asphyxiates its host.

157
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:14,411
- Not for children under 3. - Lois, no. Don't touch it.

158
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,551
- What can I do? - Get back.

159
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,686
Find something to hide behind. Hurry.

160
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:49,140
My playhouse!

161
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:04,029
Cheater.

162
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:08,067
