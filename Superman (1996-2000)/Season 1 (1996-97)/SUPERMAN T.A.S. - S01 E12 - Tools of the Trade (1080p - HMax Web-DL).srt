1
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:19,446
Mustard, no sauerkraut. "Metropolis Gold Exchange"?

2
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,714
Wonder if anyone's tried to rob it.

3
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:25,826
This place? You'd need a tank the size of Pittsburgh.

4
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,712
Good thing we were in the neighborhood.

5
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,687
Hold it right there!

6
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,225
I want this area sealed off.

7
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:06,799
Dan, we should move these vehicles back, establish a perimeter.

8
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,731
There's no time.

9
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:24,618
Don't you just love this town?

10
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,379
See you back at the ranch.

11
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:29,818
Hey!

12
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:48,933
From my viewpoint, the Special Crimes Unit might as well save their ammo.

13
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:51,505
<i>Wait a second.</i>

14
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,211
<i>I think the sides just evened up.</i>

15
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,692
My tank! Look what he's doing to my tank.

16
00:03:57,044 --> 00:04:00,776
<i>Looks like Superman's turned the SCU into a cleanup crew.</i>

17
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:09,284
That was pretty expensive machinery. You think Intergang's behind this?

18
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:12,551
All I can tell you now is that we're following every lead.

19
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:17,164
Whoever it is, you can bet my Aunt Patty's pension they'll be going down real soon.

20
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:22,167
Translation: you expect Superman to drop them in your lap like he always does.

21
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:26,537
- What are you saying? - I'm saying your highly-paid department...

22
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,871
can't seem to bust a jaywalker without old blue boy.

23
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,447
The SCU is always grateful for the help of any citizen of Metropolis...

24
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:39,848
including Superman.

25
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,124
Useless! Worthless! A joke!

26
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:58,267
- Careful, boss. - I keep telling you guys...

27
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:02,205
Intergang needs real armaments. Weapons of mass destruction.

28
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:05,004
And all I get are toys.

29
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,844
What was that?

30
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:16,083
- Who are you? - My name is Kanto, Mr. Mannheim.

31
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:19,454
I've been authorized to offer you some assistance.

32
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,294
By whom? Start talking.

33
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:28,367
Please, put away your so-called weapons. I can assure you they're unnecessary.

34
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,238
I come bearing gifts.

35
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:56,988
That's tempered steel. It's melting like cheap margarine.

36
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:03,288
Okay. I'm impressed, but I still don't get it.

37
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:06,396
Someone sent you here just to give us these things?

38
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:10,262
Including this. It's called the Armature.

39
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:13,735
When activated, it forms two hands of raw energy...

40
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:17,273
hands which perfectly simulate the motions of the gloves.

41
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:35,092
The energy hands, of course, possess a greatly amplified strength.

42
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:39,888
Okay, I want them. What's your boss want in return?

43
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:44,066
- Nothing, for now. - It's my experience that nothing...

44
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:48,673
- can get very expensive. - Consider this a free sample.

45
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:54,673
Your benefactor will explain everything at the proper time, a time of his choosing.

46
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,472
Good day.

47
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:05,554
Call the boys. It's time for another job.

48
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:42,387
Then the guy disappears into thin air like bad gas.

49
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,928
Strange stuff's going on, Maggie. I never seen anything like it.

50
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:49,431
You shouldn't have gone. You could've been in terrible danger.

51
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,592
That's why I'm called Terrible Turpin.

52
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:54,838
I'm serious, kiddo, we got rules here, procedures.

53
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:58,306
I can't have you peeking over fences like a schoolboy.

54
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:02,436
- Maybe you'd like it more if I could fly. - You're way out of line, Turpin.

55
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:05,777
All I know is the tank had Mannheim's mitts all over it.

56
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,361
This department's gonna collar that dog if

57
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,854
I have to grab a leash and drag him myself.

58
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,153
Look sharp. Here it comes.

59
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:06,736
<i>All units, radio alarm received from the 4:20 money train.</i>

60
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:09,135
<i>Repeat. Radio alarm received.</i>

61
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:12,644
You coming? Or do you wanna wait for Superman?

62
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,087
Coming through!

63
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,120
Big train wreck. Someone was on the tracks...

64
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:35,994
and right now I wish it was the guy who built this stupid elevator!

65
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,051
Hey, Superman! Over here!

66
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,713
Come and get it!

67
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:26,102
They're working for Mannheim. Let's get the SCU tanks and...

68
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,441
And what, knock down his walls? Oh, the judge'll love that.

69
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:33,516
- We gotta hit while the money's hot. - We don't know what we're up against.

70
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:37,678
Dan, listen. I wanna bring Superman in on this, officially.

71
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:41,792
You're kidding! Mannheim is mine, Maggie. My collar!

72
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:45,487
- Inspector, give it a rest. - All right.

73
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,700
You got your number-one man. Good luck.

74
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,876
Inspector Turpin, I believe.

75
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:06,373
Amazingly, you employed our weaponry quite well. My superior was pleased.

76
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:10,878
- Pleased enough to tell us who he is? - Pleased enough to give you this.

77
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:13,873
It emits a concentrated energy beam...

78
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,148
capable of destroying even the most invulnerable of targets.

79
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,757
Is that a fact?

80
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:30,524
Dan's a good soldier, Superman. Tough as a bulldog but not quite as patient.

81
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,499
- Think he'll come back? - If I had a dime for every time...

82
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,903
Dan Turpin threw in his badge, I'd make Lex Luthor look like a pauper.

83
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:40,501
Where the devil is he?

84
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,044
You don't think he'd try something foolish?

85
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:44,704
I'd count on it.

86
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,715
You know what having this gun means, Turpin?

87
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:52,151
- I can take it off your Christmas list? - I'm gonna own this town.

88
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,223
I'm gonna own the world.

89
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:59,321
With toys like these, who can stop me?

90
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:04,492
- Hey, this thing's going nuts. - It's an early-detection device.

91
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,735
- What's it detect? - Superman.

92
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:12,107
Well, here's our chance to give this little baby a workout.

93
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,747
Some grip, huh, Superman?

94
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,078
Guess I don't know my own strength.

95
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:51,934
Superman! You gotta get out! Mannheim's got some new weapon.

96
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,940
Strangest thing I've ever seen.

97
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,618
I think that hurt.

98
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,704
You know what's really amazing? I'm not even firing at full power.

99
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,876
Get ready to eat it, Superman.

100
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,888
Get off me!

101
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:48,990
Get off!

102
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,348
Kanto!

103
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:25,195
I'm just catching my breath. Go get him.

104
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:28,635
Kanto!

105
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:40,782
Wait. You've gotta help me. Give me something, some weapon.

106
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,942
You had your chance.

107
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:02,001
Not only is Mannheim out of business in Metropolis...

108
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:05,608
but we finally broke the back of Intergang once and for all.

109
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:09,906
We? Looks to me like Superman saved your skin again.

110
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:11,612
Other way around.

111
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,287
If it wasn't for Dan Turpin, I wouldn't be standing here tonight. Thanks.

112
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:20,718
Anytime, pal.

113
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,493
So tell us, where's Mannheim?

114
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,333
I think he's moved outside our jurisdiction.

115
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:55,721
- Where in God's name are we? - That depends.

116
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:57,986
Which god are you talking about?

117
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:02,328
Listen, I'm through with these games. I want some answers!

118
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,933
You gonna tell me who you work for?

119
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:13,173
- Welcome to Apokolips, Mr. Mannheim. - Who are you?

120
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:19,077
Your new lord and master. You may call me Darkseid.
