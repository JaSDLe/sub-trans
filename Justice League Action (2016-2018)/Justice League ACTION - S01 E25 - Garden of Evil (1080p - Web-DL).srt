(EXCLAIMS)

166
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,942
Ugh. What is this gunk?

167
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,544
Ooh, Swampy!

168
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,180
Buddy, take it easy!

169
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,616
Destroy them, shmoopy.

170
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,719
I'm not your "shmoopy."

171
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,321
Shmoopy!

172
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,125
Shmoopy? Shmoopy-whoopy!

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,196
- Plants, get them. - Don't bother.

174
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,899
That gunk blocks your ability to control plants.

175
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,069
Now everything will return to normal.

177
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,890
I'm taking Ivy back to Arkham.

178
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,425
Ah, yeah, here's the deal.

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,095
I'm sorry about that, but you told me to improvise.

180
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,798
Don't worry, Batcakes. I'm gonna change it right back.

181
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,168
Wait. I like it.

182
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,570
What? Are you as blind as a bat?

183
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,939
(GASPS) Batman's blind as a bat!

184
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,642
Did you guys know about this?
