1
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,794
BATMAN: Batman to Green Lantern, report.

2
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,130
Hal, do you copy?

3
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,665
Yeah, yeah, I... I read you, Bats. What's up?

4
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,268
BATMAN: I'm bringing in Kanjar-Ro and his gang.

5
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,670
You took a few good hits in the battle.

6
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,439
Sure you're okay?

7
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,141
What? Are you kidding?

8
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,175
Good to go.

9
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,643
BATMAN: Glad to hear it.

10
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,346
Can't look like a lightweight in front of Batman.

11
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,148
Just need to get my head together.

12
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:49,293
A-ha!

13
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,186
Good timing, Robogas.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,688
Best automated refueling station in the quadrant.

15
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,261
And second cleanest bathrooms.

16
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,099
GREEN LANTERN: Uh, eenie, meenie...

17
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,567
This one.

18
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,515
Ah!

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,485
Ah! Okay.

20
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,653
That is better.

21
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,858
What? Ow!

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,529
ALIEN: Hmm. LOBO: Mmm.

23
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,568
Looks like I might've forgot to put the power ring back on.

24
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,102
Oopsie.

25
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,673
Good thing Batman insists I wear this dumb emergency life-support belt...

26
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,544
which I probably should've charged at some point, ever.

27
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:56,650
Come to me, power ring of Sector 2814.

28
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,823
Anytime now.

29
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,426
No, no, no, no, no! Gone.

30
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,295
Okay, don't panic, Hal.

31
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,728
I'm sure some good Samaritan dropped it in the lost and fou...

32
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,834
Agh! Lobo.

33
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,770
Ah!

34
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,542
- Follow that Spacehog.

35
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,810
You've got it, Mr. Jordan.

36
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,820
Can't this bucket go any faster?

37
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,855
I'm exceeding the space speed limit already.

38
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,958
Perhaps we could contact a nearby Justice Leaguer.

39
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,560
No, no, no, no.

40
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,562
How do you think that conversation goes?

41
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,765
"You left the most powerful weapon in the quadrant in a gas station loo?"

42
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,868
"Loo"? "Loo" doesn't sound very Batman.

43
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:53,207
Oh, whoa. Do you think he calls it the bat-room, because of the...

44
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,942
Oh, I just remembered.

45
00:02:54,975 --> 00:03:00,314
I got an automatic upload of a galactic positioning system or "GPS."

46
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,783
It's a real firecracker. Here, watch.

47
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,787
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM: How may I be of assistance?

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,725
Extrapolate Lobo's destination and plot an intercept course.

49
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,926
It works really fast...

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,120
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM: Plotted.

51
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,414
Lobo's intercept coordinates initiated.

52
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,773
Here goes nothing.

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,946
Nailed it.

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,749
All right, Lobo. Cough up that power ring.

55
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,652
Ooh! I don't know what you're talking about, Greenie.

56
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,689
But you just scuffed the main man's hog.

57
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:49,530
You listen to me, you dirty low-down stinking Czarnian garbage.

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,998
You're gonna give me that ring

59
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,768
or I'm going to take you apart piece by filthy rotten piece.

60
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,544
You tired yet, sport?

61
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,479
Hey, listen, Lobo.

62
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,548
In the heat of the moment, things were said.

63
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,484
I probably crossed the line with that "Czarnian garbage" comment.

64
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:14,054
I guess sometimes words hurt more than punches.

65
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,457
How about we test that theory?

66
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:24,031
Pull up! Pull up, you bike-stealin' space cop.

67
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,667
Since you asked so nicely...

68
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,406
Feeling a mite heavy.

69
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,808
- You're tough, but I'm a test pilot.

70
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,611
I can take 15 Gs during breakfast...

71
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,414
while most punks...

72
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,949
will pass out.

73
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,718
Now, come to me...

74
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,920
power ring of Sector 2814.

75
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:54,995
Oh, boy.

76
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,698
You were right about Lobo, Hal.

77
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,667
He's wanted for multiple offenses,

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,034
but why not bring him in yourself?

79
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,937
HAL: What, Bat... Bat...

80
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,374
breaking up.

81
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,476
And out. Who'd have guessed it?

82
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,810
Lobo was telling the truth.

83
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,779
Well, you can never judge by appearances.

84
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,547
My granny used to say that.

85
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,650
Hey, maybe you never put the ring on in the first place.

86
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,852
I sometimes forget to put on my watch.

87
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,754
I had it, okay?

88
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,656
It must be at the refueling station.

89
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,991
But there was nobody...

90
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,795

91

You've got to get us back to the station as fast as possible.

Thanks, Cabbie.

Oh! No, no, no, no.

Hey, Green Lantern, guess what?

My new app says that's not an alien momma and her baby at all.

112
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,609
It's a two-headed Babajorian.

Evidently, their upper head acts as some kind of natural defense mechanism.

Can I give you a lift anywhere?

166
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,221
No thanks, pal.

167
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,991
Right now, I'm in the mood to fly.

168
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:58,065
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM: That passenger. There was something familiar about him.

169
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,833
The Green Lantern?

170
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,936
That's a strange thing for a navigational app to say, GPS.

171
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,105
I'm not a navigational app.

172
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,941
I'm a disembodied artificial intelligence

173
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,243
with no memory of my origin.

174
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,846
That's okay. We make a great team.

175
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,715
You can stay here in my cab forever.

176
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,985
Negative. I feel compelled to search for something

177
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,152
or someone.

178
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,289
That Green Lantern did not give up hope...

179
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,892
But...

180
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,960
and neither shall I.

181
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,231
Well, that was weird.

182
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,037
Green Lantern to Batman. Heading back to the Watchtower.

183
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,238
Rendezvous with you there.

184
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,707
BATMAN: You all right, Lantern?

185
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,308
Never better. Why do you ask?

186
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,943
Because Lobo here said something

187
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,113
about you leaving the most powerful weapon in the quadrant

188
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,782
in a refueling station bathroom.

189
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:54,121
Sorry, Batman. Interference. Bat...

190
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,056
I'm never gonna live this down.
