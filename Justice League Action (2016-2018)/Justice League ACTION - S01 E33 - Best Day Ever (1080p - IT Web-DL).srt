This really was none of my doing. (CHUCKLES)

173
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,375
Pleading innocence while putting on your war suit?

174
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,578
Not convincing, Lex.

175
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,846
(SIGHS) Worth a shot.

Isn't this the perfect ending to our perfect day, Lex?

00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,075
(GROANS)

182
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,544
You, me and our little super friends

183
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,347
going up in one last big boom!

While I take out the biggest threat.

(GROANS)

193
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,859
LEX: Not today.

194
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,295
- Not this way. - BATMAN: Not ever.

195
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,232
Yeah, well, we'll see. Won't we?

196
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,807
Finally, I return to sweet sanity.

JOKER: Lexi, baby, booby!

198

It's like we never parted.

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,480
What's this?

200
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,749
Your new roommate, Luthor.

201
