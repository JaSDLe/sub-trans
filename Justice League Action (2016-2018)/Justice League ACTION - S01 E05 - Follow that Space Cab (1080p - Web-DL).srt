00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,028
Mr. Lobo,

168
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:01,032
didn't anyone ever tell you about worms?

169
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,371
Ha! Those blockhead heroes.

170
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:10,008
Don't they know we worms are built for regeneration?

171
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,781
SUPERMAN: Yes, we did know that.

172
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,683
Darn.

173
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,455
I hate everybody.

174
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,324
We owe you big time, Cabbie.

175
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,859
Yeah. Speaking of owing,

176
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,028
my meter was running the whole time

177
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,731
and my cab was totaled and this is my job, so...

178
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,800
I don't seem to have any cash on me, uh...

179
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,504
I plucked this piece of anthracite out of my wings earlier.

180
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,739
- Perhaps... - SUPERMAN: Coal.

181
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,676
- Perfect. - (CRUMBLING)

182
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,911
I think this will cover everything.

183
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,114
(WHISTLES AND LAUGHS) That'll do.

184
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,849
Actually, there's one more thing...

185
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,318
(CAMERA CLICKS)

186
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,060
