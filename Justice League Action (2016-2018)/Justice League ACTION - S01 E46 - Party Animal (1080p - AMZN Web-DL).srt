176
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:54,978
Hey.

177
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,904
That looks just like the teddy I gave Grundy.

178
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,205
No wonder he's mad.

179
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,940
Why does everybody hate that bear?

180
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,676
Wait! I know where Grundy is going.

181
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,311
Everyone, follow Batman.

182
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,614
Flash, I need to find somebody. Fast.

183
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,115
We're comin' out by the street.

184
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,751
Maybe we should start slowing down.

185
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,185
Sleds can't talk.

(BOTH GRUNT)

190
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,868
Leave him be!

191
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,605
Are you insane?

192
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,974
Trust me. Come on over.

193
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,778
Aw!

194
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,613
What's going on?

195
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,114
Hey, there. It's okay.

196
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,984
(GRUMBLING)

197
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:49,256
Uh, Grundy sorry. Scare you.

198
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,062
For you.

199
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,266
No one be without present at Christmas.

200
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,268
Teddy.

201
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,875
Mmm.

202
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,083
Wow! Who needs a big fancy party?

203
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,651
I could stay here...

204
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:18,852
Oh, my...

205
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:21,021
You know, the S.T.A.R. Labs party

206
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,723
is like two blocks away.

207
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,924
Race ya.

208
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,895
Well, it is Christmas Eve.

209
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,330
I still can't believe they scheduled it the same night.

210
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,131
I mean, the nerve.

211
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:35,068
Okay, well, maybe see you there.

212
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,044
Be sure to invite me next year.

213
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,080
I did it.

214
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,983
I really did it.

215
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,085
Hey, guys, what about my party?

216
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,921
Uh, we've got the hall till midnight.

217
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,155
