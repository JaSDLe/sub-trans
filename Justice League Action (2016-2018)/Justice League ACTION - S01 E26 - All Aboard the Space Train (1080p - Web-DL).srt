00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,993
You know we can't bring that back with us.

167
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,995
You don't have to, masked man.

168
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,064
Got some grub from the train.

169
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,333
Thought I'd stay a piece.

170
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,536
We got several ways to get you back to your own time.

171
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,471
Sure you don't want to go home?

172
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,908
That there's the prettiest sunset I ever saw.

173
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,379
Reckon I am home.

174
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,617
Anyway, <i>adios.</i>
