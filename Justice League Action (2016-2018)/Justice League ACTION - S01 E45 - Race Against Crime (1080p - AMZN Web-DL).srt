Where are we?

169
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,779
I've reprogrammed the belt to send its energy signal directly to Flash's belt.

170
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,581
Here, plug this in.

171
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,650
Then what?

172
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,018
Then run.

173
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,986
May the Speed Force be with you.

(BEEPING)

176
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,829
Now that you have the added power of Superman's Speed Force,

177
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,797
you can vibrate through that time-wall

178
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,099
and stop Luthor before it's too late.

180
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,841
FLASH: (STRAINING) Almost there. Almost there.

181
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,777
(PANTS) Phew.

183
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,650
LEX: Finally.

184
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,951
It's my time.

185
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,152
- FLASH: Ahem. - Huh?

186
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,186
Booga-booga.

- (ALL GRUNT) - (BOTH GRUNT)

192
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,110
I feel so good again!

193
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,246
All that anger, it's suddenly gone!

194
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,116
Wait till they set your bail.

195
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,686
Looks like you're due for a time-out, Luthor.

196
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,988
Ten to 15 in Stryker's Island prison.

197
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,790
I'll have him there in 15 seconds.

198
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,292
Ha! I could be there in two.

199
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,960
Hmm. Race ya.
