169
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,615
Want to know how we did it?

170
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,950
It wasn't a virus.

171
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,651
It was something even trickier.

172
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,053
You can come out now.

173
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,756
I thought you'd never call.

174
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,659
I was getting claustrophobic in there.

175
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,894
What did I miss?

176
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,366
Master! The Boom Tube generator is active.

177
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,634
It is, indeed.

178
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,036
And with this portable Mother Box...

179

(BEEPS)

180
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,174
I can send you away, Darkseid.

183
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,749
(CHUCKLING) Nice.

184
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,684
Where did you send him?

185
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,220
To the acid lake planet, Schlough.

186
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,290
I still never gave him his receipt.

187
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,158
We've got all the prisoners aboard.

188
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,328
Too bad Darkseid couldn't join them.

189
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,167
Cabbie! I really want to thank you for the help you gave us.

190
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,169
You sure we can't give you a lift?

191
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,504
No. Jack's got this.

192
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,972
He's a one-bot body shop.

193
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,075
You guys can take off. I'll be fine.

194
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,951
- What's the verdict, Jack? - (BEEPS)

195
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,725
Oh, great! Now how are we going to get off this rock?

196
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,961
(BEEPING)

197
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,197
No way. I'll walk home first!

198
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,703
Roxy Rocket at your service.

199
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,238
Hop on and hold tight.

200
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,608
Oh, if the other cabbies hear about this,

201
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,777
I'll never live it down.

202
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,645
Make some room back there.

203
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,616
I got another fare to pick up on the acid lake planet, Schlough.

204
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,551
Some guy named Darkseed?

205
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,986
Dark... Darkseid?

206
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,888
Whoa!
