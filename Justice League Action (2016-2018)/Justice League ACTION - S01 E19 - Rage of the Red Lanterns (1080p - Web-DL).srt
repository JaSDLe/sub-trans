00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,640
Give it a rest, jabber jaws.

170
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,310
WONDER WOMAN: We have a secure prison on the edge of the galaxy.

171
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,879
Lobo won't be causing any more problems for you.

172
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,447
SUPERMAN: He'll pay for his crimes.

173
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,719
As you provided the edge in battle, Lobo is yours.

174
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,123
What? That's outrageous! We fought much more courageously.

175
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:29,628
ATROCITUS: Except for protecting your leader. Where were you then, Zilius?

176
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,832
Er... Let's not get into who was where.

177
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:39,203
I wouldn't want you to be angry at the others and their extreme cowardess.

178
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:45,476
What I meant to say was, great decision, master! You're three for three today.

179
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,279
BATMAN: That's why I prefer working alone.

180
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,948
Sometimes.

181
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,151
I prefer working alone sometimes.

182
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,958
