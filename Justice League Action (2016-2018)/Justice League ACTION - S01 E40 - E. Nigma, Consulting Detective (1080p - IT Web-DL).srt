The hunting motif and the stuffed vulture are telling you the rules.

Another word for foot soldier is grunt.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

172
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,370
JOKER: This good guy routine is getting old.

173
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,473
Eddie, face it. You're just like me.

174
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,408
Crazy as a soup sandwich.

175
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,610
(JOKER LAUGHS)

176
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,047
Yield.

177
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,683
Okay, I give.

178
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,919
You solved all my riddles.

179
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,353
Except one.

180
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,956
(LAUGHS) And, ooh, it's a good one.

181
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,527
RIDDLER: "What has four eyes but doesn't see?"

182
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,129
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

183
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,699
But solve this.

184
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,269
And the Dark Knight ends up diced tomatoes.

185
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,071
A voice activated trigger.

186
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,240
If he answers the riddle, the sword falls.

187
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,109
Ooh, you're smarter than he looks.

188
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,678
So, let me get this straight.

189
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,213
All I need to do is not answer the riddle?

190
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,752
That's right. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

191
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,956
(CHUCKLES) I won't say a word.

192
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,724
Then by all means,

193
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,092
don't answer it.

194
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,994
I won't.

195
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,263
Oh, really?

196
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,300
You're not compelled to answer?

197
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,403
Well, that's fine.

198
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,106
You probably don't know the answer anyway.

199
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,312
You have to say it, Eddie. (CHUCKLES)

200
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,514
That is, if you know it,

201
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,350
which I doubt.

202
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,588
(GROANING) Mississippi!

203
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,425
Mississippi has four eyes, but doesn't see.

(BELL RINGS)

205
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,996
Made you talk! (LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

206
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,636
Whew. Hey!

209

GREEN ARROW: So, let me get this straight.

210
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,983
This whole time, Joker was using Batman to get to you?

211
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,451
What did you do to him?

212
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,954
That's the one riddle I haven't solved.

213
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,024
Ha! You know exactly what you did.

214
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,999
You did all this because he ate your donut?

215
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,336
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

216
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:43,141
Okay. We're gonna head back to the watch tower.

217
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,010
But, uh, hey, Nygma, you did good today.

218
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,979
I did, didn't I?

219
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,782
You two blockheads wouldn't have gotten anywhere without me.

220

Riddle me this, Gotham.

222

Who's getting better and better every day in every way?

223
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,393
Me!
