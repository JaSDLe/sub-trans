Zod? But we trapped him in the Phantom Zone with the other Kryptonians.

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,816
It appears this explosion opened a temporary rift between the zones.

Zod escaped before it closed.

Some sort of energy came off the prism.

I've never seen a piece of Krypton that looked like this.

And a lovely little human punching bag.

169
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,098
Indeed. He will be the first of his kind to...

170
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,867
kneel before Zod!

(WHISPERS) What do I do? What do I do?

175
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,877
Don't panic.

176
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,446
There's one more thing we can try.

177
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,650
Okay, Zod, you know what? You got me, you win.

178
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,587
But before you start taking over the world and stuff,

179
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,389
could you let me join my friends in the Phantom Zone?

180
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,925
I do not usually grant requests.

181
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,528
But knowing the torment that awaits you,

182
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,530
I'm inclined to make an exception.

183
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,599
Thanks, man. Really doing me a solid.

184
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,772
Get them!

187
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,679
Hold still.

188
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,281
This won't hurt a bit.

No!

We'll get you for this!

200
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,623
Maybe, but I doubt we'll feel it.

201
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,127
Booster, are you all right?

202
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,130
Oh, Bats. I never knew you cared.

203
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,333
I got to admit, taking on Zod like that was incredibly brave.

204
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,135
Your timing was perfect,

205
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,469
for once.

206
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,138
Glad I could help.

207
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,041
Now, how about we fire up that projector and get me out of here?

208

Guys?

209

Come on, guys.

Oh, come on! Seriously?
