TV ANNOUNCER: The Daily Planet News Parade.

All the day's headlines brought to you in luxurious sepia tone!

4
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,930
The March of War!

5
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,267
The Kasnian Peoples Republic continues its invasion of the West,

6
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,404
thanks to their new weapon, the Superman.

7
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,539
No one but Kasnia knows where he's from

8
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,143
or how he can possess such strength and terrible might.

9
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,445
Does anyone have the power to stop him?

10
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,249
Or will more cities fall to the conquering red menace?

11
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,383
And in entertainment,

12
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,286
Kara Zor-El continues to conquer our hearts.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,824
The last survivor of Krypton and star of TV's most-watched reality show

14
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,526
can melt steel with a glance.

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,828
But can she ever find true love?

(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

TV ANNOUNCER: Hey, now, wait just a second.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,804
If these super folks join forces and use their powers in league

19
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,406
for the cause of justice...

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,743
(LAUGHS) Uh, but of course that's not the world we live in.

People don't appreciate just how much I bust my butt.

26

It's not easy to produce a network show,

That sounds so familiar.

Nothing! What does it get me?

20% of nothing.

You're right, Morty.

50
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,376
I'm not gonna let anything spoil this.

51
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,545

Oh, I can do something.

61
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,407
I can teach that Kasnian creep

62
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,709
to stay out of my spotlight.

Oops! Oh, sorry, little buddy.

Well, stop it.

78
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,999
So, I was just outside the space-time continuum in my Booster cave...

79
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,468
It's not really a cave,

but now Superman and Supergirl are dressed all weird

83
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,776
and fighting each other.

You don't say.

I do say!

86
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,861
Normally, when this kind of thing happens it's because I went back in time

87
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,053
and swallowed a butterfly.

88
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,522
But this time, I knows it wasn't me.

89

How?

90
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,918
Because I switched to caterpillars.

91
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,427
Anyways, the point is,

92
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,663
I didn't cause this.

170
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,306
SUPERGIRL: My agent is right.

171
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,609
It's total science fiction.

172
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,678
No, it actually... Wait, agent?

173
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,546
You!

174
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,514
Never told me you were an agent.

175
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,719
So considering it's named after you and all,

176
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,821
you think I can get a spot on that Mxy Zone show?

177
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,823
That thing sounds terrif.

178
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,158
Golden Oaf is right.

179
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,595
Agent is Mxyzptlk.

180
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,597
- A what? - This is my agent Morty.

181
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,665
He made me the person I am today.

182
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,067
Exactly. It is imp in disguise

183
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,703
who made us this way.

184
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,771
Even this simple clown could see through.

185
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,040
Oh, clown? Where?

186
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:05,045
Fine! You outsmarted me this time, Booster Gold.

187
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,348
But I promise you it will not happen again!

188
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,652
- Sorry, what? I was still looking for the clown. -(SNAPS FINGERS)

189
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,960
What has imp done?

190
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,195
What are we doing?

191
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,732
What he made us do.

192
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,934
How could you? He was only trying to help.

193
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,336
You're better off without him. Trust me.

194
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,939
Now! Let's reset this reality

195
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:35,208
and get you two self-righteous bumpkins

196
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,344
back at each other's throats.

197
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,012
Huh! Foolish imp.

198
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,682
It is just like we say in my country.

Kltpzyxm.

201
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,654
I know... (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

202
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,357
But what the heck does Kltpzyxm...

203
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,059
Oh, no.

204
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,863
Um, what just happened?

205
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,632
I make him say his own name backwards.

206
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:03,103
I remember, this is how we vanish annoying imp and set things back to normal.

208
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,241
Good bye, Golden Oaf.

209
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,877
And thank you.

210
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,984
Do you... Remember?

211
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,652
Everything.

212
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,387
Look, I want you to know that

213
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,355
even though we weren't ourselves...

214
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,692
I know that I would never, I...

215
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,660
Well, I never could have, um...

216
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,697
I love you too.

217
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,135
Um... What about me?

218
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,771
I took a giant steel globe to the head for you guys.

219
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,673
I'm fine by the way, thanks for asking.

220
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,274
Did you eat our pie?

221
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,711
Would you look at that? I'm getting an urgent time call.

222
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,679
So weird. I gotta go. Bye.

223
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,319
You ever think about

224
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,355
how different life would be if we weren't born on Krypton?

225
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,757
Nope!
