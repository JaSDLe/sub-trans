Oh, great.

17
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,670
A Batman-themed magician, just what this town needed.

18

I am Batman.

19
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,111
I know. I get it. You realize you'll be competing with

20
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,513
the Shazam-themed magician at the Desert Empress, right?

21

You're coming with me.

22
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,749
To Apokolips.

23
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,152
I'm sorry, sometimes this mask impedes my hearing,

24
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,720
but I guess you know that.

25
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,489
You said Albuquerque?

26

No! No, no no!

28

You do not want to go to Apokolips,

30
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,297
It's my hometown planet I left for a reason.

31
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,866
I don't have time to argue.

32
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,634
Good, me either.

33
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,571
I have to be across town to open for that hack Zatanna. Ugh.

Ta-da!

37
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,132
I'm a master of escape. You didn't think a little rope was going to hold me, did you?

38
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,422
You won't get away that easily.

There's a cape code! What about the cape code?

42
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,324
(GROANS) I sense a lot of hostility here.

43
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,726
Have you thought of yoga?

44
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,830
Correction, you had me.

45
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,600
Sorry to leave in a hurry, but I have a show to start!

Sorry, Bats. No one can catch Mr. Miracle!

For an evil, elderly person.

57
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,175
I told Darkseid I would handle it.

58
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,877
You have.

59
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,246
We'll take it from here.

60
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,481
I don't think so.

Follow me, Bats.

00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,319
You've been very, very bad.

69

But just because I like you.

97

Listen, enough games. Darkseid has a hostage

98
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,422
and she's finished unless I bring you to him.

It's not even me they're after.

What is it?

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,895
The last part of the Anti-Life Equation.

102
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,865
The missing key to Darkseid's Life-Void Machine.

103
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,267
<i>It's a brutal weapon of insurmountable power,</i>

<i>capable of stretching across galaxies and vaporizing any and all sentient thought.</i>

<i>Leaving only mindless shells controlled by Darkseid himself.</i>

the world as we know it will just...

108

Without it, I can't save Barda.

109

That's who Darkseid has.

110

You look... good.

Stonier than usual.

123
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,508
You could have ruled by my side.

124
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,579
But instead you chose to run away.

125
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,850
Well, maybe if someone spent as much time with me as he did with Kalibak,

126
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,318
I would have stuck around.

Once I place it in the machine,

the universe will bow before the will of Darkseid.
