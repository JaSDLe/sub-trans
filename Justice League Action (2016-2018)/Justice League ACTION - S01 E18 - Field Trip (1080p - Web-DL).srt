What can I say?

169
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:53,891
Chemistry, ho-ho, it is not my best subject.

170
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,094
And then, Firestorm and the Professor

171
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,929
fixed the Phantom Zone Projector.

172
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,131
And don't worry about those Kryptonite chains.

173
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,301
Firestorm's absorbing all the green energy coming this way.

174
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,838
(LAUGHING) It's like having your own alien heat lamp.

175
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,074
Argh! Aren't these chains enough of an indignity?

176
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,877
How much more of this teenage blather must we endure?

177
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,646
Not much at all, Zod.

178
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,048
(BEEPS)

179
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,383
(SCREAMING)

180
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,587
I'm glad you three were able to accomplish so much

181
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,821
working together.

182
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,456
Because now you can put all that teamwork

183
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,092
into cleaning up this mess.

184
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,131
Starting with that.

185
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,366
Alien kitty!
