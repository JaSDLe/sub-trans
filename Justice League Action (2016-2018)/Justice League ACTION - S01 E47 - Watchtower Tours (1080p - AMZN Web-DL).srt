1
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,127
What are you doing here, Booster?

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,728
Reporting for watch duty.

3
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:31,299
You have never reported for your watch duty shift. Ever.

4
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,734
But, hey, I'm here now. Ready to stand watch.

5
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,737
And I know it doesn't look like I take my League duties very seriously,

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,639
but I really, really do.

7
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,311
No, really, I do.

8
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,745
BATMAN: Fine.

9
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,414
I'll see you in six hours.

10
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,318
BOOSTER GOLD: You mean... Oh...

11
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,686
Thanks, Batsy!

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,389
- You can stop talking to me now.

13
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,424
Done!

14
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:11,339
Welcome to the Justice League Watchtower Guided Celebrity Tour and Souvenir Emporium!

15
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,612
- So, how was the journey over on my very own personal yacht?

16
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:19,747
Rental.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,250
Your Captain is strange.

18
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,684
That is Captain Skeets.

19
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,619
Cybernaut of the seven seas.

20
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:30,524
Excuse me, but your website said we'd be greeted by a hero.

21
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,859
Yeah.

22
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,227
Me.

23
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,097
Booster Gold.

24
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,634
The Notorious B.G.?

25
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,872
Come on, hero from the future?

26
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,674
You know it.

27
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,482
Got a real bug problem here, bruiser.

28
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:59,353
And on your left the last of our three laundry facilities.

29
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,193
No questions? Okay, last stop, the boiler room!

30
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,560
MAN: I have a question.

31
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,728
This is dull!

32
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,765
We paid good money. Show us your cool toys, future boy!

33
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,167
Oh!

34
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,769
I know who you are.

35
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,678
You're my favorite! Let's go.

36
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,624
And this is Booster One,

37
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,960
my very own private jet!

38
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,498
Why does it say, "Justice One"?

39
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:48,302
Oh, that's a typo. We're going to send it back to the shop in a little bit.

40
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:53,441
No offense, but do any of the real superheroes have aircraft?

41
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,377
Oh, just the big guys, like me and Bats,

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,479
you know Batman. Yeah, that's my dude. Yeah.

43
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,649
That's one of the Batjets over there. The ugly one.

44
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,920
Does Wonder Woman have a jet?

45
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,290
Uh, sure, yeah. It's, uh...

46
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,424
It's here somewhere.

47
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,725
Around here, somewhere.

48
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,295
- I don't see it. - Ah, yeah, it's, um...

49
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,797
It's invisible.

50
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,667
Ooh! Did you hear that, Teddy?

51
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,540
Tourists.

52
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,842
This isn't the powder room.

53
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,612
Nah, I just said that to get you to stop asking.

54
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,981
This is way cooler. We call it the kitchen.

55
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,451
- Computer, recognize Booster Gold.

56
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,952

57
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,554

B-O-O...

00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,793
COMPUTER: Recognized Boodika, Green Lantern Corps.

60
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,461
Initiating simulation.

61
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,763
What, Boodika? No, no, no.

62
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,837
- Hang on, I think I can...

63
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,306
- Ah!

64
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,652
You know what? That one was me.

65
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,345
- Okay, sorry.

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,752
Okay, did anyone happen to see where the door went?

67
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,057
Okay.

68
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,759
Ah!

69
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,380
Oh, right.

70
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,449
Automatic emergency space-time shift.

71
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,783
It came standard.

72
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,753
"Space" How far did we go?

73
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,056
- Uh-hmm. Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm. All right.

74
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,891
According to my calculations...

75
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,726
- I have no idea.

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,463
By that clock, I'd say 35 minutes

77
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,865
and still no ladies room.

78
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,803
And I'm out of power again.

79
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,405
Ugh!

80
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,009
Uh, it looks like it's doing something!

81
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,578
Ah, it's just scanning us.

82
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,045
Internal defenses. It's no big.

83
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,882
- COMPUTER: Suspicious device detected.

84
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,584
Initiating lockdown procedure.

85
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,990
Huh What?

86
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,825
No, it must be a malfunction.

87
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,927
Oh, it's no malfunction!

88
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,966
Toyman! What happened to your mustache?

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,468
You want malfunctions?

90
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,937
Wait till my malware infects your systems.

91
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,108
In a few hours, your precious League headquarters will be history.

92
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,110
In your face!

93
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,379
I can't believe this!

94
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,413
You used my innocent tour to gain access to this room for your own evil ends?

95
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,484
Did you know about this, Teddy?

96
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,488
Your silence speaks volumes.

97
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,925
Is he serious?

98
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,993
COMPUTER: Rapid response team deployed.

99
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,097
Response team? Is that good or bad?

100
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,433
COMPUTER: It's bad.

101
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,601
They're security drones. A lot of them.

102
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,637
They shoot stuff, and they'll be here any second.

103
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,139
Can't you emergency space.

104
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,807
My suit's still recharging!

105
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,976
No, I have to get rid of this hacking device.

106
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,478
Where is it, Toyman?

107
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,448
What's up?

108
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,749
Why are you all...

109
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,586
- Oh!

110
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,821
Shut it down, Toyman! It's the only way!

111
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:31,492
I can't! I made the forcefield completely impenetrable.

112
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,960
Why?

113
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,729
I don't know, I'm crazy!

114
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,164
They'll be here any second!

115
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,767
Maybe we can stop him with the Mother Box I brought

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,536
to send the Watchtower into the sun?

117
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,207
What? I'm Granny Goodness, come on.

118
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,777
I'm barely wearing a disguise.

119
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,879
You're telling me that three quarters,

120
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,783
nearly half of this tour group have been supervillains in disguise?

121
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,520
Hello!

122
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,755
BOOSTER GOLD: Are you kidding me?

123
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,224
I suppose you brought some kind of poisonous gas?

124
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,794
No, I really just came for the tour!

125
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:10,130
Got this idea from an old Bugs Bunny cartoon.

126
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,077
DRONE: Eradicate. Eradicate.

127
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,178
I've doomed us all!

128
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,720
Ah!

129
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,825
Huh? Ah!

130
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,574
Oh, okay. You know what? That was the last drone.

131
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,042
COMPUTER: Intruder alert.

132
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,577
- Deploying additional drones.

133
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,747
"Unknown associate"? Oh, come on!

134
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,715
Run!

135
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,994
- Sure. He's in my favorites.

136
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,829
WOMAN: Your call has been forwarded to

137
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,131
- an automatic voice message system.

138
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,267
Batman. ... Is not available.

139
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,149
Not gonna lie, that was awesome!

140
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,020
- What about the training kitchen we were in?

141
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,054
Can we hide there?

142
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,888
There's too many of them. We'll never make it.

143
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,059
Might be enough, but only for one.

144
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,929
- My bad.

145
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,033
Hero.

146
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,167
Certainly, not today.

147
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,004
- Run faster, you big battleax! - Ah!

148
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,053
BOOSTER: Duck!

149
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,328
I was getting a little bit tired of all their droning on.

150
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,930
No, no, wait.

151
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,332
How about, "Now, that's what I call a Game of Drones."

152
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,167
How about, "Romancing the Drone"?

153
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,670
- Yeah, that one doesn't even make any sense, man.

154
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,806
- In the end, they were just flesh and drone.

155
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,642
Hey, guys, could you drone it down?

156
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,944
You're good!

157
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,612
I have to hand it to you, Booster,

158
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:42,215
using your tech to create hologram duplicates, awesome!

159
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah, Goldilocks, even I'm impressed, and I'm a Batman villain!

160
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,089
Actually, these aren't duplicates.

161
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,959
These are real Boosters from alternate timelines.

162
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,032
This is Booster if I had stayed in bed this morning,

163
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:56,196
and this is Booster from a world without love.

164
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,699
I'm sad.

165
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,835
We sort of have a phone tree thing. Everybody calls two.

166
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:02,970
Hey, thanks again, guys.

167
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,673
Here you go. Marshmallows! What?

168
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,974
Everybody gets one!

169
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,241
- Got it! - Yeah, baby!

170
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,010
- All right! - Sweet!

171
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,412
- Hey, thanks, man! You're the best! - No, you're the best.

172
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,814
Ciao!

173
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,322
Not much going on at home, huh?

174
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,960
In conclusion, my grossly negligent and unlicensed tour business

175
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:30,864
was actually a clever ruse to entrap these sinister villains

176
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,400
and foil their plots to destroy the Watchtower.

177
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,488
Except Joker. He's completely innocent.

178
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,138
I think he enjoyed the tour, too.

179
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,740
Uh-huh.

180
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,274
So, you see, Batman,

181
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,811
you're not the only one who can keep a bunch of plates spinning,

182
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:47,280
manage every detail, and always stay one step ahead of disaster.

183
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,850
Now, if you'll excuse me,

184
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,852
Skeets and I have a boat we have to return to

185
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,287
-yachts of fun.

186
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,092
You might want to avoid that door.
