(GROWLING)

5
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,194
Look out.

6
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:38,236
No mercy for the human slime, my simian warriors.

7
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,806
We take this world today.

8
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:45,010
Fight! Fight for Gorilla City and simian kind everywhere.

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,912
STARGIRL: That's a lot of gorillas.

10
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,882
Specifics, Stargirl. You are evaluating an active threat to the UN.

11
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,417
Oh, great. (CHUCKLES)

12
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,353
Okay, there are like 30 to 40 gorillas attacking

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,322
the United Nations building with ray guns.

14
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,692
Probably minions of that bad gorilla in the jail files I had to read.

15
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,428
- Gorilla Gropp or something. - Grodd.

16
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,697
Relax, Stargirl. You are doing great.

17
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,833
Remember, every leaguer had a first day.

18
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,334
Everything will be just fine.

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,436
Tell that to the UN delegates about to be abducted

20
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,406
by a super intelligent megalomaniacal gorilla.

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,774
Remember your training.

22
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,709
Be efficient. Ruthless.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,278
Neutralize your foe.

24
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,781
And have fun.

25
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,616
It's important to enjoy your work.

26
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:32,090
The puny humans are inferior in both mind and body.

27
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,460
We will crush them beneath our feet.

28
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,065
Hands.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,868
Crush beneath your hands, because you have hands on your feet.

30
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,707
That's what you get for fighting with these peacekeepers.

- (GRUNTS) - Ah...

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,280
Sorry, Batman.

33
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,515
Apologize later.

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,850
Situational awareness now.

35
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,986
This is mostly just a ride along, Stargirl.

36
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,623
To see firsthand how a couple of vets handle a routine situation.

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,392
Routine?

38
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,961
The end of human domination of Earth.

39
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,263
You call this routine?

40
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,332
I call it a light morning workout.

41
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,701
With no cardio.

42
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,403
Execute caged heat.

43
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,482
Yah.

44
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,853
(SCREAMS)

45
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,990
That was more fun than a barrel of monkeys Grodd. But now you're done.

46
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,392
Done?

47
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,894
Are you kidding me?

48
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,062
Mr. Mxyzptlk.

49
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,298
He's so cute!

50
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,667
What's a mxy...

51
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:53,471
How could you not know me? You are breaking my heart.

52
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,509
I thought you had memorized all the Justice League dossiers I gave you.

53
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,277
I have been cramming like crazy.

54
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,214
I learned all about the atomic guy with two personalities,

55
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,915
and backward talking lady magician.

56
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,418
But when I read this guy's name on the file,

57
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,286
I thought it was just a typo.

58
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,888
Hey, watch it, girl.

59
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,224
I'm the funny one here.

60
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,960
Don't underestimate him.

61
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,230
Mxyzptlk is an alien imp from the fifth dimension

62
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,498
with powers beyond our understanding,

63
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,035
and a pathological desire to create chaos.

64
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,971
That's mischief.

65
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,306
Mr. Bats in the belfry.

66
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,574
Mischief.

67
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,576
Let me give you an example.

68
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,714
The only way to stop his nonsense is to get him to say his name backwards.

69
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,616
Watch this, kid.

70
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,025
(GROWLING)

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,563
Hey mister, looks like you are a little mxyed up.

72
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,965
Mixed up!

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,168
Say, that's not a bad idea.

74
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,706
In fact, it sounds like fun.

75
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,016
STARGIRL: Uh, hey, what's up with my man hands.

76
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,351
SUPERMAN: Great Scot! I am in Batman's suit.

77
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,153
(BATMAN'S VOICE) Not just my suit, Superman.

78
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,556
Mxyzptlk played musical chairs with our minds.

79
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,093
But we've still got to stop those gorillas no matter what condition we are in.

80
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,296
(STARGIRL'S VOICE) You don't have to tell me twice.

81
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,798
(SCREAMS)

82
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,866
Stargirl.

83
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,136
Oh, shoot. I forgot.

84
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,470
No flying for me.

85
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,538
(GROANS) Oh.

86
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,373
Everything smarts.

87
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,575
Even Batman's boots are too tight.

88
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,911
All right, let's see how this thing works.

89
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,047
Ah! Whoa!

90
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,350
(GROANS)

91
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,586
Not so fast, you.

92
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,721
Ow.

93
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,757
That hurt.

94
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,395
Superman, are you okay?

95
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,564
Ow, my hand.

96
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,266
Sorry. Sorry.

97
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,668
My bad. (GIGGLES)

98
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,437
My heat vision. Shut it off.

99
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,538
I don't know how.

100
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,506
Think cold thoughts.

101
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,408
Icicles, Minnesota.

102
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,911
Batman's disapproving stare.

103
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,714
If I knew it was going to be this entertaining,

104
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,117
I would have sprung for the good seats.

105
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,385
(GRUNTS)

106
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,090
We can't let this body switch throw us off our game.

107
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,793
You seem to be doing fine in my body.

108
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,329
I have never relied on superpowers, Stargirl.

109
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,331
Only skill.

110
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,233
I still know how to throw a punch.

111
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,902
Oh, argh.

112
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,371
(LAUGHS)

113
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,307
It appears the Justice League is having an identity crisis.

114
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,111
We will never have a better opportunity to crush them.

115
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,813
Crush this, Grodd.

116
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,715
How's this come off?

117
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,750
Got it.

118
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,953
Watch out for those bat bombs.

119
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,087
They have a hair trigger.

120
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,622
(GROANS)

121
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,524
Good safety tip, Batman.

122
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,627
This body switch doesn't seem to have diminished your effectiveness.

123
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,897
I know.

124
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,731
Isn't that great?

125
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,467
I am so excited about it.

126
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,569
Er... Are you like, okay, Batman?

127
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,204
Batman is used to fighting multiple foes,

128
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,874
but not with the volatile emotions of a teenage girl.

129
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,709
What's that supposed to mean?

130
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,145
Why is everyone staring at me?

131
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,884
I've waited a long time for this victory, Batman, Superman, whatever.

132
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,559
You will have to wait a bit longer, Grodd.

133
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,721
Thanks to Batman's batarang.

134
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,289
Missed.

135
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,125
Well, there's an entire bat arsenal on this belt to take care of... Ah!

136
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,460
Whoa...

137
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,164
I think I have super allergies.

138
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,170
<i>Gesundheit.</i> (LAUGHING)

139
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,040
This is too much!

140
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,111
I can't even... I can't even...

141
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,947
This isn't working.

142
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,382
We got to deal with Mxyzptlk before we deal with Grodd's army.

143
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,897
I think we should call in the cavalry.

144
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,419
We need backup.

145
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,455
Firestorm especially.

146
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,656
But won't Mxyzptlk just...

147
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,424
Excellent, Stargirl.

148
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,628
Batman to Justice League. Send Bravo Squad to my location.

149
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,830
Bring Firestorm.

150
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,732
Repeat. Bring Firestorm...

The world is ours.

154
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,640
Ready.

155
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,777
Aim.

156
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,948
Hey, Grodd.

157
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,950
Where does an 800 pound gorilla sit?

Answer, anywhere the Justice League tells him to, yo.

I don't mean to toot my horn, but I'm gonna toot it.

Hey, look, Professor. I am Shazam.

Ugh, I am not Shazam.

No, I am Shazam.

Yes. For Mr. Mxyzptlk.

Hmm, interesting.

Inappropriate laughter can be a symptom of hypomania...

00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,660
I did. Dr. Martin Stein.

One half of the hero Firestorm.

How did you get in my head?

Get out of here!

193
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,770
Oh, you are an anthropophomaniac. That's fear of other people.

Stop psychoanalyzing me.

197

You sound like a hallunologophogomaniac.

198
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,149
That's one who fears complex scientific terminology.

Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Oh...

Stargirl, I just wanted to commend you on your quick thinking.

217
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,874
Knowing that Firestorm was a dual personality,

218
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,777
you surmised that the additional consciousness

219
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,313
would make its way into Mxyzptlk's head.

Good job, rookie.

Was it?

00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,088
Frankly, I kind of wanted to meet him.
