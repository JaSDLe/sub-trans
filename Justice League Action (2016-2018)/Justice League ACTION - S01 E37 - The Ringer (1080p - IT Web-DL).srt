What's up, guys?

165
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,112
I got our culprit right here.

166
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,514
Little spider mushroom fella.

167
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:22,153
Spider mushroom? I'd say he looks more like a crab fungus.

168
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,824
Oh, I don't know. Might be more of a squid pickle.

169
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,893
Really? Hmm. I'm thinking more

170
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,263
of a moldy, pineapple cockroach.

171
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,101
The name's Despo... Oh, never mind.

172
