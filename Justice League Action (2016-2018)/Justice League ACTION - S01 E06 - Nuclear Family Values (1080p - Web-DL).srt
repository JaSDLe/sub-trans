Shanner opposed nuclear warfare

<i>to show the terrible effect of that power on ordinary people.</i>

Okay, right, right. So you're saying it's up to us to stop them. Got it.

127
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,787

Nothing like a good old-fashioned pool party. Am I right?

00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,134
Why are you doing this? I mean, there's better ways to barbecue

132
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,698
than by causing a nuclear meltdown.

Uh, no.

136
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,638
It's like this, Sparky.

137
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,640
For as long as we've been a family,

138
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,208
Mom, the kiddos and I...

139
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,578
Well, we've been wanting a little place we could call home.

140
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,747
Oh, it was so hard living on the run.

141
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,184
Squatting in fallout shelters and hazardous waste dumps.

142
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,753
Certainly no way to raise a growing family.

143
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,522
Then, Dad brought us here.

144
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,190
Isn't it awesome?

145
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,160
And now, we're gonna blow it up.

146
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,828
Ka-bluey!

147
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,130
Wait, but that's gonna wipe out half the state!

148
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,500
Sure, it'll be a little toasty for the folks outside,

149
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,102
but here's the good news.

150
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,772
We can finally live in peace in a radioactive wasteland.

151
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,375

(GROANING) What happened?

154
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,054
Interesting. The androids have connected us to the main reactor.

155
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,491
The more you struggle, the more power the reactor absorbs.

156
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,092
Okay, so how do I break free?

157
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,162
A super charge to the fuel rod pool might do it.

158
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,097
Say, from one of the androids?

159
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,134
Uh, I don't see any of them jumping in the pool to play Marco Polo.

160
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,903
(GASPS) Well, maybe...

Good boy!

164
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,185
(ALL SHOUT)

165
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,690
Don't freak, don't freak, the pup's okay.

166
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,426
- (GROWLS) - Ow! You're welcome.

167
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,994
What do we do, Dad?

168
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,129
I didn't want it to come to this.

169
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,600
Seeing as how our powers make us keen to Sparky and all,

170
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,236
but, uh, spank him.

171
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,977
Honey, we can still blow the reactor

172
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,013
if you give the core one of your famous blasts.

173
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,581
(KISSES NOISILY)

174
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,550
Just watch me cook.

175
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,486
My power is thermal pulse.

176
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,723
It can raise the temperature higher than a nuclear reactor.

177
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,292
In other words, the heat is on!

178
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,596
Ah, it sounds so lame when he says that, am I right, Prof?

179
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,900
(BOTH GRUNT)

180
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,035
What's going on?

181
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,738
Ah, no reason to fight fire when I can absorb it!

182
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,206
Leave my brother alone!

183
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,977
You're next, small fry.

184
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,214
Not fair! Mom!

185
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,615
In a minute, sweetie.

186
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,584
(BEEPING)

187
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,588
Huh?

188
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,029
- Good heavens. (GRUNTS) - (THUDS)

189
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,399
(GRUNTS)

190
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,836
You're no match with the old masters, Sparky.

191
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,605

(ALARM BLARING)

194
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,189
Ahhh!

195
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,934
(GRUNTING)

196
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,306
Dad? If our powers really do make us related,

197
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,177
well, let's be like other families and hug it out!

198
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,912
(ALL GASP)

199
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,394
What happened to the androids? Did you destroy them?

200
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,296
No, I didn't have the heart.

201
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,565
I mean, at the end of the day, all they really wanted

202
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,467
was a little place to call home.

203
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,935
<i>So I gave it to 'em.</i>

204
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,742
WONDER WOMAN: Powerful and compassionate.

205
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,812
That goes a long way in my book.

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,783
Just so he's not too soft on criminals.

207
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,820
Superman? Wonder Woman? Batman?

208
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,455
Am I in trouble?

209
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,692
I can fix that. Yeah, I'm gonna need some duct tape.

210
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,728
All right, I need, like, a lot of duct tape.

211
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,965
We saw the end of your fight. You did very well, Firestorm.

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Even Batman was impressed.

213
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,106
We feel you could be a candidate for the Justice League,

214
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,008
if you're willing to work with us first.

215
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,412
Whoa! The Justice League? (STAMMERS) That'd be awesome.

216
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,880
What do you say, Prof?

217
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,416
Well, Ronald, what can I say, but...

218
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,552
The heat is on.

219
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,488
Yeah, that's the spirit, Prof! High... (STAMMERS)

220
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,658
Uh, headbutt, let's headbutt.
