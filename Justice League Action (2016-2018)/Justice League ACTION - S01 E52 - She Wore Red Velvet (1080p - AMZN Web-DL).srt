you leave Margot at the altar, it drives her mad,

167
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:26,640
If there is anyone here that objects to this union, speak now or...

168
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,275
I do.

169
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,612
Batman! You're about to ruin the happiest day of Margot's life.

170
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,280
You're a terrible bridesmaid.

171
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,016
Booster, when Red Velvet attacked the Watchtower,

172
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,619
she was wearing a gold and ruby wedding band,

173
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,288
identical to the one you put on Margot's finger.

174
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,223
It's the same ring.

175
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,627
Wait, if it's the same ring, when did Red Velvet get a hold of it?

176
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,195
Right now.

177
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,064
It's not being left at the altar that drives Margot mad,

178
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,600
it's marrying you.

179
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:59,172
Booster Gold was the worst husband ever.

180
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,540
Duck!

181
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,243
RED VELVET: He invested my family's fortune in fly-by-night schemes.

182
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,781
Come on. Beach-front property on Pluto?

183
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,951
Nuclear barbeques? Self-zipping pants?

184
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,254
I'm wearing them right now. They're great.

185
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,466

190
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,568
I mean, it couldn't have been all bad.

191
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,371
He goes bald.

192
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,106
Really, really bald.

193
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,278
And he snores like a lumberjack.

194
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,627
- All right, I'm out. - (RING CLINKS)

196
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,033
Huh?

197
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,168
Margot?

198

(ECHOING) Margot!

199

WONDER WOMAN: So, in this alternate timeline,

200
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,377
the Watchtower was destroyed?

201
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,646
You know, if I've said it once, I've said it 100 times.

202
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,148
We should've built this thing in space.

203
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,151
How can we be sure this Red Velvet isn't still out there?

204

(BEEPS)

205
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,694
There's no record of her, even in the future.

(SIGHS)

207
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,963
Red Velvet never existed.

208
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,167
Booster, I know how difficult this must be.

209
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,338
But you'll get over it in time.

210
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,341
Do you have Giganta's number?

211
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,311
I know she's a villain, but I guess that's my thing now.

212
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,281
You got Giganta's digits?

213
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,784
Hey, it's not like you're gonna use 'em.

214
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,786
Always a bridesmaid, right?

215
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,755
Bats, come on!

216
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,056
She's huge.
