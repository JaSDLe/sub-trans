Maybe not so happy.

We're not just robots anymore, Darkseid.

You programmed us to be heroes,

Hey, guys,

we did good today.

It's Batman.

(LAUGHING) That sounds so weird coming out of your mouth.

BATMAN: We received your distress signal.

00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,391
In Darkseid's hands that data could have led to our destruction.

So, what now?

We've gone way beyond our original programming.

There's plenty of other worlds.

I'm sure one of them could use heroes like you.
