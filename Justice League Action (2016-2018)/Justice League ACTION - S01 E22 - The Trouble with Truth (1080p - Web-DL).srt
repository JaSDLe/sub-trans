00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:31,936
Where are you going?

<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

173
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,842
<i>- six, five...</i> - (WHIMPERS)

174
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,410
<i>four, three...</i>

175
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,246
All right. Computer, cancel autodestruct sequence.

176
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,316
Hive master, one bee, two bee, three.

177
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,153
COMPUTER: <i>Code recognized. Deactivating bomb.</i>

(SIGHS)

179
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,457
Brava, Diana.

180
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,226
But weren't you worried the bomb would go off?

181
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,962
He was always willing to sacrifice others,

182
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,697
but not himself.

(GASPS)

184
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,067
You would've made a good Goddess of Truth.

185
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,370
Thank you... Wait! What?

186
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:10,608
It doesn't take a lasso of truth to know you belong here.

187
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,976
Athena, I...

188
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,678
Diana of Themyscira,

189
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,546
I have witnessed your strength,

190
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,317
your resourcefulness and your ability to inspire.

191
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,920
Heroing is a bit more important than I thought.

192
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,956
I am nothing but proud.

193
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,961
Anyway, I better get going. Traffic and all.

194
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,296
See you later, grumpy.

195
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,332
Hey, what about the God of Love?

196
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,900
That's an archery job, right?

197
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,001
I'm a natural.

198
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,003
Yes, that could work.

199
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,606
Although you'd have to wear a diaper.

200
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,674
A diaper?

201
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,109
Well, never mind.

00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,951
