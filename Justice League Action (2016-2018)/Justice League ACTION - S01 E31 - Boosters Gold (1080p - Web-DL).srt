(BOTH GRUNT)

169
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,588
Yup, that's you, all right.

170
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,863
What do you think, Green Arrow?

171
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,959
These pants really make me look like that?

172
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,962
Green Arrow.

173
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,131
That takes a long time to say.

174
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,699
Have you considered shortening it?

175
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,168
To what? Just "Arrow"? I don't think so.

176
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,105
No, I meant just "Green". Like, Green.

177
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,340
- You sure this is gonna work? - Of course.

178
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,042
All we have to do is disable the power

179
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,611
and shut down your TV before you ever get your

180
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,580
"brilliant" idea in the first place.

181
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,914
Get your power blast ready.

182
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,951
Right-o. Nip it in the bud.

183
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,919
Wait a minute. I mean, do we even have the right

184
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,788
to stop that world from ever existing?

185
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,658
It was a flourishing, utopian society.

186
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,894
- Who are we to decide the destiny... -(BLASTING)

187
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,830
What? What were you saying, buddy?

188
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,225
Not totally paying attention there,

189
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,933
kinda went a little bit whacky.

190
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,370
Oh, it was, uh, nothing important. Forget it.

191

(GROANS)

192
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,709
Oh, hey, Green Arrow. What are you doing here?

193
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,146
Never mind that. What am I doing here?

194
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,749
GREEN ARROW: (SIGHS) I need a vacation.
