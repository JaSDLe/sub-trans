Can you close the portal?

178
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,341
Sure, if I had my other arm.

179
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,409

Close the portal.

Your magic is nothing compared to mine.

184
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,023
Give me that book. Now!

185
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,925
All right, all right. Got it, mate.

Good job, Constantine.

Good job? Look at this place.

Mr. Anderson is going to kill me.

197
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,660
Definitely not going to pay me.

Oh, yeah. He was a little angel.

Daddy, there was a man here.

It was Batman!

No. I'm good. I'll make sure to call you.

Well, it's a beautiful night. Think I'll fancy a stroll.
