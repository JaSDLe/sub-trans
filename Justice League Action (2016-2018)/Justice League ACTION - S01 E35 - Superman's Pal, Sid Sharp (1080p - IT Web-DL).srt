Better off walking there.

Hey bud, you forgot to pay!

00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,439
Me pay you? You should pay me!

8
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,642
For making me late for the story of the year!

Sid Sharp from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

Cut to the chase! What's the low down here?

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,725
I already gave the other guy from the <i>Planet</i> my statement.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,160
Why don't you go ask him?

17
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:06,064
No, no, no, not him, not again!

18
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,833
You poaching my story, Kent?

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,302
Uh, hey, Sid! What do you mean by poaching?

20
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,817
I've been here for 20 minutes already.

21
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:14,840
How? I just ran here as soon as it hit the wire.

22
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,677
I've got my sources. Maybe next time, Sid.

Nothing!

You're hearing things, Clark.

27
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,088
Next time you get new glasses, check your hearing too.

00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,559
Why would two big gangsters have alien weaponry?

I'm sure it wasn't just to rob a bank.

Well, Mr. Sharp.

You're a genius, Olson.

Hah! I don't care what they say about you.

43

Wait, what do they say about me?

44

I finished my analysis of the alien weaponry.

It's definitely from Apokolips.

I'll be right there.

Sid was just abducted by Darkseid's goons.

to save him.

This little fish isn't even the man of oatmeal.

Wait a minute, Mount Rushmore.

98
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,420
Superman's my pal.

00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,955
He's gonna be upset, you kidnapped me.

100
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,526
You stand with Kal-El of Krypton?

101
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,395
If that's who you call Superman, then yes.

102
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,030
Sorry, it's hard to understand you.

103
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,000
Got some phlegm in your throat or something?

104
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,903
You dare mock a god of Apokolips!

105
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,872
Just saying, team ugly over here might have a better shot

106
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,240
at following orders.

107
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,043

then he shall live.

112
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,590

00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,114
(GRUNTS)

129
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,150
Need more time.

130
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,622
You three stand watch while I tell Lord Darkseid

131
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,391
about our victory.

132
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,996
I never dreamed you three could be as dim-witted

133
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,664
as you are revolting.

134
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,101
You're just going to let him waltz out and take credit like that?

135
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,903
The Earthling has a point.

136
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,205
Why should Kanto receive the glory?

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,242
True, Kalibak was hoping for a big hug from Father.

138
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,944
Don't just stand there, go get him!

139
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,781
KANTO: What madness is this?

140
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,217
You dare lay your hands on Kanto?

141
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,987
Before Superman got here, I heard Mr. Mustache say

142
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,122
that if the plan failed,

143
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,291
he's gonna blame it on you two dummies.

144
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,092
Is that true, Kanto?

145
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,528
You would believe the Earthling over a member

146
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,497
of Darkseid's Elite?

147
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,599
Actually, now that I think about it,

148
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,669
Hoody over here was the one who said it.

149
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,206
Desaad used dirty tricks.

150
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,409
Surely, this is just the Earthling's ploy to...

151
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,544
He hasn't the wit to lie, Desaad.

152
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,481
Enough, all of you!

153
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,082
Bring me the Kryptonian.

154
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,420
Before I turn all four of you into ash.

155
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,689
Almost ready.

156
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,924
As you see, Lord Darkseid,

157
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,561
our trap worked, and this Superman is now ours.

158
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,831
I mean, yours.

159
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,433
I expected more.

160
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,702
From the last son of Krypton.

161
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,705
Yeah, big chief stone face, you let him have it.

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,174
You had one job, big blue cheese,

163
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,109
and you blew it!

164
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,811
Ha. Some rescue...

165
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,366
- I'll say this about the Earth people. - took your sweet time...

166
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,616
- They always keep things interesting. - man of tomorrow.

167
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,317
They should call you the man of how about,

168
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,319
sometime next week!

169
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,388
Sorry I disappointed you, Sid.

170
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,224
Maybe you can make it up to me.

171
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,232
Father!

172
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,840
He's mine.

173
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,642
Not if I have anything to say about it.

174
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,793
DARKSEID: Kryptonian?

175
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,607
(RUMBLING)

176
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,842
(GASPS)

177
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,012
(SID EXCLAIMS)

178
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,620
Superman, that cockamamie remote control is our ticket out of this dump.

179
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,035
Para-demons, attack!

180
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,871
Hey, that was a pretty good swipe.

181
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,741
Guess we know why they call you the man of "steal".

182
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,976
(LAUGHING)

183
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,620
Desaad.

184
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,657
You have failed me

185
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,826
for the last time...

186
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,427
This mean no hug?

187
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,662
Hmm.

188
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,734
And then Superman was like, it's up to you, Sid.

189
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,103
And I was like, but you're Superman.

190
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,170
And he said,

191
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,373
you're the Superman now.

192
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,909
(CHUCKLES) Come on now, Sid, he didn't say that.

193
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,245
Which one of us was there, sunstroke?

194
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,082
You can read all about it in today's early edition.

195
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,184
Don't worry.

196
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,585
I'll invite you to the inevitable.

197
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,687
Pulitzer Prize ceremony.

198
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,356
Chief?

199
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,759
You're not gonna believe the story I have for you.

200
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,926
I don't know, Sid.

201
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,795
Kent here just turned in quite a doozy.

202
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,732
Superman doing battle on some alien world called Apokolips?

203
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,933
Apokolips?

204
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,802
I was just gonna tell you!

205
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,604
I gotta go tell them to hold the front page

206
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,106
for Clark's story!

207
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,774
Uh...

208
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,242
That reminds me, I took your advice

209
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,144
and had my ears checked yesterday.

210
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,112
Turns out there's no need to worry.

211
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,048
I can hear as well as I ever did.

212
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,064
