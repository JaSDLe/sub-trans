but I defeat the Justice League as well.

167
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,034
Best of all, I finally get rid of you.

168
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,304
Bang! (LAUGHS)

169
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,575
How's that for commitment to the role, Batman?

170
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,744
Pretty good, huh? Huh?

171
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,615
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

172
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,283
I have to admit,

173
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,720
you were fairly effective tonight.

174
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,124
So, we can work together again?

175
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,327
If I need a shape-changer and the Martian's busy.

(BATARANG FIRES)

177
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,935
Do you hear that? Me and Batman, we're like this...

178
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,171
I gotta ask, Plas.

179
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,273
When you change, your clothes change, too,

180
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,843
so, what is it? Some unstable atoms?

181
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,211
What's what?

182
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,880
Your, uh, your uniform.

183
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,717
What uniform?

184
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,386
So, you're saying you're not wearing any... (SCREAMS)

185
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,224
I gotta go! I gotta go! Oh, my eyes. My eyes.
