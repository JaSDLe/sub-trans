(DEX-STARR YOWLING)

173
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,638
Settle down in there!

174
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,241
So, our big outing was just part of a Red Lantern Corps diversion?

175
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,943
Get the League out of the way,

176
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,258
then use the Watchtower to Boom Tube in the invasion force.

177
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:15,182
And to carry it all out, they sent their cleverest,

178
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,719
most diabolically fiendish operative!

179
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,721
They sent a cat.

180
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,156

Anyway, you stopped him, Plas.

184
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,163
You saved the world.

185
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,766
Well, I...

186
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,502
I helped.

187
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,908
You still haven't told us how you trapped Dex-Starr.

188
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,410
Let's just say, it was all in the line of...
