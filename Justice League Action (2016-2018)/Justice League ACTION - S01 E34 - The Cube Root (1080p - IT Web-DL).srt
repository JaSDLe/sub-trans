Keep going. I'll get their attention.

Sorry about this, guys.

Ronald? Are you okay?

172
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,594
Yeah. You know, just hangin'.

173
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,767
I guess my S-Cubes were no match for your T-Spheres, after all.

As I was saying,

179
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,759
one click of my controls and that sphere will blast you to oblivion.

180
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:26,164
And I estimate your chance for escape will be zero!

Zero!

Oh, this sphere, right?

184
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,042
I think I know what's wrong.

185
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,648
Hey, Prof, what are you doing?

186
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,417
It's a long drop.

187
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,288
Professor, that sounds like a first-team, starting line-up bad idea.

188
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,090
It's the only way, Ronald.

189
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,191
Here I come!

190
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,827
Not in the face!

191

Reunited, whoo!

Fifteen to 20 at Stryker's prison.

I've severed Calculator's control over the T-Spheres.

198

Gotta change their programming so they can't be hacked again.

Wouldn't mind your help, Martin.

200
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,862
Ronald. Please tell him that now I realize

201
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,966
the schematic of his spheres are completely original.

Uh... The Prof says he's sorry about being such a bonehead.

I didn't say that exactly.

I feel for you, kid. Martin may be brilliant,

PROFESSOR STEIN: I'm a terrible roommate?

Ask him about the dirty dishes,

the cat hair, the burping and the firecrackers!

209

I haven't forgotten about the firecrackers!

And don't get me started about the bathroom etiquette!
