00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,450
(GROANS AND PANTS)

168
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,753
It's not enough. We're not gonna make it.

169
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,255
- I don't accept that. - (GRUNTING)

170
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,758
You said you've beaten creatures like this before?

171
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,560
Yeah, but never this big.

172
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:53,164
Still, you fought them. What's different this time? Why now?

173
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,267
There's two of us. That's twice the drain on my power cells.

174
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,769
I'm only half as effective.

175
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,306
What are you doing?

176
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,208
I'm sorry, Bats. I have to push you outside the time stream.

177
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,643
Just trust me.

178
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:09,514
Booster, do that, and I'll be returned to just before we left.

179
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,116
I won't remember any of this.

180
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,953
That's okay, Bats. I will.

181
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,355
I was wrong about you.

182
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,491
You're a better person than anybody gives you credit for.

183
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,627
Maybe one day, I'll find that out.

184
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,098
Round two.

185
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,344
(GRUNTING)

186
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,258
(SCREAMING)

187
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,928
Not once. Repeatedly.

188
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,263
It's a pattern of behavior. You're lazy.

189
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,366
You're unprofessional, unfocused.

190
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,669
Booster! You're the worst crime fighter I've ever known.

191
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,673
You know what?

192
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,777
(SIGHING)

193
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:17,015
Nothing. Nothing. Just, you know, never mind.

194
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,351
You're right, Bats. You're always right.

195
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,456
Sure you weren't too hard on him?

196
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,792
No. He needs this.

197
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,737
(SIGHS) Yeah.

198
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,972
Better times.

199
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,645
