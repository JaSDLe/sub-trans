Bad red versions of both of them knocked you around,

70
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,265
then flew off with a faulty radiation emitter?

Told ya. They've taken good to a whole new level.

A weird one.

The emitter has a unique Kryptonite radiation signature.

I've wired the emitter to the Watchtower's power core,

How is red Luthor good?

The blues contained our true natures,
