That's Fassan's vehicle,

00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:35,311
But where's our target, boys and girls?

4
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:39,866
So are you here for the high risk or the low pay?

5
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,501
Actually I'm here to keep the world safe

6
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:44,638
From warlords and petty dictators like Fassan.

7
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,645
"cave"? Well, duh.

00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:28,682
<i>Not cave, cave. It's latin.</i>

9
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,684
It means, "beware."

10
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,985
Signal our position. And remember,

11
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,155
We want Fassan alive for trial, if possible.

You did say "alive if possible," right?

15
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:02,799
This isn't Fassan’s handiwork. Pull back.

How's the Sarge?

He'll live, but we need to get him back to base.

It seems we have an unexpected guest.

115
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,803
Not that we should be surprised.

I mean, you're a superhero.

Of course you are!

And I'm sure you can account for the fact

123
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,284
That since your so-called Justice League formed,

124

I'm here because all that stuff you said

00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,574
about the League being in this for money isn't right.

133

You do what you do for less selfish reasons?

136
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:34,867
Exactly. Like Green Lantern explained to me earlier...

137
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,602
Don't. Don't say it.

147
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:57,506
But I didn't...

00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:58,508
You... I...

149

Nothing personal. It's just show biz.

It's not like it's the end of the world.

151

That's exactly what it is.

Do you listen to Mophir? Now world ends.

155
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,342
Not Mophir's fault.

156
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,245
But Mophir know how world works.

I don't know-- thousands, maybe millions.

172
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:10,963
It's a start.

173
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,802
Today I have a report from Dr. Frederick,

174
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,504
The respected child psychologist,

175
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:20,623
In which he states, and I quote:

176
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:23,809
"some children who admire these overpumped superheroes

177
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,729
"do poorly in school, quarrel with their siblings,

178
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:29,249
And refuse to eat their vegetables."

179
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,284
I'd like to ask the Just-us League

180
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:33,686
How they respond to these accusations.

181
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:34,921
But I can't!

182
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:37,223
Because they don't have the nerve to show up here!

185
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,396
Why are they afraid of me?

186
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:44,663
What do they have to hide?

Someone needs to put him in his place.

No. If we respond,

192
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,310
We'll just encourage him.

193
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:02,932
Role models? Look, I've seen showgirls with more modesty

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,934
Than this so-called Wonder Woman.

I will not tolerate this!

But in this country, the man's entitled to his opinion,

198
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,732
However bone-headed it is.

Hey, didn't the Greeks invent that?

And what's wrong with the way I dress?

The birth of a new age in missile defense.

205
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,940
Rather than trying to shoot down enemy missiles from space,

206
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:48,744
We believe that our new AFD Anti-Fusion Device

207
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,530
Will enable us to completely neutralize enemy warheads

At the point of detonation.

Don't move.

Being a superhero, I'm always on the run,

And I can't afford to slow down for anything,

Not even gastrointestinal distress.

Oh, I can't say this!

They can kiss my boots.

I'm not saying it!

232

You're his agent. You deal with him.

Listen, Bunkie, you know you're my number one guy.

00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,570
Talk to me. Artie Bauman is completely here for you.

You say the word, we walk.

Great. Let's go.

237
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,642
You can't. We already got paid,

238
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,427
And I spent my 60 percent.

239
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:19,912
Forget it.

240
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,097
No one's asking the other guys to do this sort of thing.

241
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:24,316
That's because they don't have

242
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:25,634
What you have.

243

What, my speed? My charm?

244
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,473
They don't have me as their agent.

245
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,741
So tell them to call me,

246
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:35,844
Especially that big gal with the rope.

247

Now let's make some magic.

You can't escape.

338
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,515
Give yourself up.

339
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,605
Never! I know what you want.

340
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,241
But you can't have it!

341
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:07,208
Have what?

342
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:09,444
My precious diamond.

343
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,773
No! Stay back!

344
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:24,943
Its dark power can destroy the world.

345
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,377
Not anymore.

346
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,002
Hey, princess, fire's out.

347
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,187
Need a hand in here?

348
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,839
Wonder Woman: No. He's finished.

349
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:42,210
Whoa!

350
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,415
That was a little harsh.

351
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,618
Are you feeling all right?

352
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:51,786
I'm fine.

353
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,821
But there's still so much to do.

354
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:00,362
