1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,528
The delegates from Kasnia are just arriving.

2
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,129
Any sign of trouble?

3
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:25,332
Nothing here.

4
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,869
Zilch. Not even a sleazy politician.

5
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,604
Are you sure we need to be here?

6
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,205
According to my sources,

7
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:34,908
Terrorists have targeted this international peace summit.

8
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:37,211
Flash: They would have to do it during the playoffs.

9
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:39,513
J'onn: What if these terrorists are already inside?

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,182
I've got that covered.

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,618
[all talking at once]

12
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:46,053
Look, Lois, I know you'd give your eye teeth

13
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:47,254
For this assignment,

14
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:49,607
But someone had to cover that sanitation strike.

15
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,909
[Lois speaking indistinctly on telephone]

16
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:53,811
Don't blame me! Talk to Perry!

17
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,198
Green Lantern: Hey there.

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,816
Hey, yourself.

19
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:01,202
Aren't you supposed to be patrolling the north end?

20
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,586
I thought I saw trouble over here.

21
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,071
There's no trouble.

22
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:05,706
Sure there is.

23
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,491
And I'm looking right at it.

24
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,393
[kiss]

25
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,545
You're bad. You should know.

26
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:13,914
And you should get back to work.

27
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:15,632
But after we're done, let's get some take-out

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,684
From that Chinese place near your apartment.

29
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,620
Great. But this time, no eel heads.

30
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,524
Lightweight.

31
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,126
Woman: General Welles.

32
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,912
I'm picking up an unidentified bogey

33
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,846
Heading toward Washington.

34
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:32,450
I've tried contacting it, but there's no response.

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,420
Scramble interceptors.

36
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:37,888
I want visual confirmation.

37
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:40,173
Man: Roger that.

38
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:44,728
Weird.

39
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:46,813
Radar says it's there, but I can't see it.

40
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,749
Still no response?

41
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,218
No, sir, and it's entering D.C. Airspace.

42
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,054
Take it down.

43
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:00,011
Direct hit!

44
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,667
Holy...

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,064
G.L., report!

46
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,835
Not exactly your garden variety terrorists.

47
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,288
It's a Gordanian class-7 cruiser!

48
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,356
What? Watch out for the plasma cannons!

49
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:30,974
Aah! Aah!

50
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,621
[screaming]

51
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,481
I'll draw their fire.

52
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,549
We'll take out the rear stabilizers.

53
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:56,800
Wait! Don't!

54
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,521
Aah! Aah!

55
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,347
Any other suggestions?

56
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,155
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

57
00:03:35,223 --> 00:04:22,586
Hawkgirl: No! Wait!

58
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,151
You know these guys?

59
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,485
Yes.

60
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:31,955
Welcome to Earth, commander.

61
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:34,175
Thank you, lieutenant.

62
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:36,460
Care to tell us what exactly is going on here?

63
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:39,230
This is commander Hro Talak, of Thanagar.

64
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,714
Save the introductions for later.

65
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:42,449
I must meet with your world leaders.

66
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:45,035
The fate of this planet may hang in the balance.

67
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,726
Talak: Friends, we are here on a mission of great urgency.

68
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:55,762
5 years ago, we secretly sent an advance agent to Earth

69
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,565
To learn more about your people and to study your defenses.

70
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:01,418
That agent was lieutenant Shayera Hol,

71
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,821
Better known to you as Hawkgirl.

72
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,856
You mean she's a spy? Cool!

73
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,792
She was spying on us.

74
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,427
Oh, yeah. Huh.

75
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,148
Unfortunately, she discovered that Earth's defenses are sorely lacking.

76
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:17,318
With your limited technology, you are totally unprepared

77
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,102
For what is about to come.

78
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:25,376
The greatest evil in the universe.

79
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,811
Our mortal enemies, the Gordanians.

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,921
For generations, we on Thanagar have been locked

81
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:41,124
in a bloody war with these monsters.

82
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,526
[distant moaning]

83
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:54,305
Across the cosmos, they have committed unspeakable atrocities,

84
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,241
Decimating world upon world.

85
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:00,811
And now, they are coming here.

86
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,015
This will be the fate of Earth, unless you accept our help.

87
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,238
[murmuring]

88
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,877
I know you'll need to discuss this amongst yourselves,

89
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:18,512
But be quick about it.

90
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:22,049
We are your only hope of salvation.

91
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,171
All this time... Why didn't you tell me?

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,091
John, there were so many times I wanted to.

93
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,392
But?

94
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,029
This was a military mission.

95
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:37,631
I'd sworn an oath of secrecy,

96
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,999
And I couldn't tell anyone.

97
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,968
Sorry, but not even you.

98
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,837
You're a soldier. I'd think you'd understand.

99
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:47,140
So... What else aren't you telling me?

100
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,009
Well, actually--

101
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,210
Talak: Shayera.

102
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,546
There you are. Hro.

103
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:56,767
Darling. At last.

104
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:04,675
Sorry. Hro Talak.

105
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,394
John Stewart.

106
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,046
The Green Lantern.

107
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,331
Shayera has told me so much about you.

108
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,583
Has she?

109
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,284
And you two are...?

110
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:17,221
Hro and I are promised to each other.

111
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,473
It's like being engaged.

112
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,726
Congratulations.

113
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,712
I'm sure you two must have a lot of catching up to do.

114
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,649
I thought he'd be taller.

115
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,706
Man: You saw what one Gordanian ship can do.

116
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:38,409
What chance would we stand against an entire fleet?

117
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,377
But can we trust the thanagarians?

118
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,296
We don't know anything about them.

119
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,463
We know they came here and risked

120
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:45,049
Their own lives to help us.

121
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,883
Like angels from heaven?

122
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:49,319
Sorry, princess. I'm not buying it.

123
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,722
It does seem almost too good to be true.

124
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,340
But if Earth really is in danger,

125
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,859
We can hardly afford to turn away help.

126
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:57,611
I can't believe they're still discussing this.

127
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,613
It's such a no-brainer, right?

128
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,148
Yeah.

129
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,442
Batman: The most mysterious creatures in the universe.

130
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,627
Sorry? Women.

131
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,845
Don't be too hard on yourself.

132
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,730
You didn't know she was spoken for.

133
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:18,165
How did you--

134
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,650
It wasn't hard to figure out.

135
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,652
The point is, these things happen.

136
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,304
You just have to deal with it.

137
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,589
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

138
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,108
Believe me.

139
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:31,595
I know how painful it can be when two people who are so involved--

140
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:32,746
Who's involved?

141
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,682
Wait. You and Hawkgirl?

142
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,352
Get out!

143
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,754
Really?

144
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:42,873
Imagine how hard this situation must be for her.

145
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,975
She's been here, alone,

146
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,094
On a strange planet, far from home.

147
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:49,196
Who knows what she must have gone through?

148
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:50,898
Maybe you should have read her mind.

149
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,051
Actually, it's strange, but I never could.

150
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,822
In fact, I can't read any of their minds.

151
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,863
Not exactly Thanagar's finest,

152
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,898
But I tried to make it feel like home.

153
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,202
Hungry?

154
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:16,190
Alonse kidneys, Korshian oysters.

155
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:18,142
Don't you like them?

156
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,977
I remembered they were your favorites.

157
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,812
No. It was very thoughtful.

158
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,884
Mmm! Awesome!

159
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:29,303
And when was the last time you had this?

160
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,055
Plume nectar!

161
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:34,691
I remember we were on leave together on Aloria.

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,110
How long ago was that?

163
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:41,282
5 years. 5 long years.

164
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:43,083
My Shayera!

165
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:46,654
[angrily] what is it?

166
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:47,955
Commander Talak.

167
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:51,175
Kragger! I left orders not to be interrupted.

168
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:53,226
I'm sorry, sir, but we're receiving

169
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:55,428
A transmission from the humans.

170
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,201
Commander Talak, the world leaders

171
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,735
Have come to a decision.

172
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,005
Earth gladly accepts your assistance.

173
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,840
Very good. We will begin immediately.

174
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,042
I'm sorry, darling.

175
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,543
Duty calls.

176
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,312
But I want you to come with me

177
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,213
And act as an official liaison with the natives.

178
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,466
Your experience with them may come in handy.

179
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,468
Of course.

180
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:23,574
Commander, a word with you?

181
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,893
I'm meet you in the landing bay.

182
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:28,412
Sir, with all due respect,

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,381
Do you think it's prudent to let her go down there again?

184
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,983
She hasn't been properly debriefed

185
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:34,485
Or psychologically assessed.

186
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:37,238
Living among those humans for so long may have--

187
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,556
You worry too much, Kragger.

188
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,641
I've always been overly cautious.

189
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,060
Still, you might want to keep an eye on her.

190
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,779
Oh, I'll be watching her closely.

191
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,049
Very closely.

192
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:50,684
And you will mind your own business.

193
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,336
Is that understood?

194
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:53,937
Yes, sir.

195
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,410
[goat bleating]

196
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,295
Move those civilians out of here.

197
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,947
We need this entire area cleared and leveled.

198
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,365
I'm on it.

199
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,843
John, we have to talk.

200
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:33,978
Nothing to talk about.

201
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,797
But I wanted to explain about Hro and me.

202
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:39,250
I'm a little busy right now, lieutenant.

203
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,494
This generator-- when we're finished,

204
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,862
It's going to be the size of a city.

205
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,563
A big one. It has to be.

206
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,516
It's got to sustain a force field strong enough

207
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,567
to protect Earth from the Gordanians.

208
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,495
I don't get what you see in that guy.

209
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,531
I mean, sure he's big and strong

210
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:13,233
And ridiculously good-looking, but so what?

211
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,286
That doesn't make him some kind of hero.

212
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:16,403
[goat bleating]

213
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,332
Here. Look after this little one.

214
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:34,371
[bleats]

215
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,625
Fine... But I still don't like him.

216
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,376
Wonder Woman: What exactly are you trying to prove here?

217
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,294
Think about it.

218
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,814
A single ship attacks a major city.

219
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:48,602
Then the thanagarian armada coincidentally shows up to save us.

220
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,171
I don't believe in coincidence.

221
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,541
So how is this going to help?

222
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:57,311
You don't know anything about Gordanian physiology.

223
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,647
No, but I know a frozen liver when I see one.

224
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,865
What?

225
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,433
The crew of this ship was dead long before

226
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,569
The thanagarians shot them down.

227
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,254
I think we've been set up.

228
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:15,511
Kragger: Welcome aboard.

229
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,314
Since you are now our partners in this great endeavor,

230
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,616
Commander Talak has asked me to show you our ship

231
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:22,719
And answer any questions you might have.

232
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:28,090
It's easy to get lost, so please stay close together.

233
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,692
I thought we'd start with the bridge

234
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,279
And then move on to our fully equipped medical facilities.

235
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:35,414
I'm sure you'll find these quite interesting.

236
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,823
Easy now.

237
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,526
Connect the absorbing plate to the integration unit.

238
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:48,627
Good.

239
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,171
This technology is amazing.

240
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,606
How does it work?

241
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:03,292
The circuits utilize Nth metal,

242
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,479
An element with properties you couldn't begin to understand.

243
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,581
Which properties wouldn't I understand?

244
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,818
The hyperconductivity or the mason-graviton inversion?

245
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,859
Man: Sector 17...

246
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,461
Second man: Received and understood.

247
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,796
Talak: Talak to comm center.

248
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,447
Link me to the high council.

249
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:26,849
Man: Right away, sir.

250
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:35,741
Commander Talak, what progress can you report?

251
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,142
Talak: We are on schedule, my lord.

252
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,344
With the help of the humans,

253
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:40,313
We should be operational within days.

254
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,047
Not a moment too soon.

255
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,298
As you see, the Gordanians

256
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,751
Have launched a new counteroffensive.

257
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,220
They have sealed off our expeditionary forces,

258
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:52,692
And their entire fleet is pressing toward Thanagar.

259
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,226
Man: You there!

260
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:56,162
How did you get in here?

261
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:57,296
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,415
I seem to have gotten separated from my group.

263
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:00,833
Don't move!

264
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:04,454
Lieutenant, I found one of your visitors in the comm center.

265
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,688
Kragger: Did he see anything?

266
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:06,922
I'm not sure.

267
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,991
Then don't take any chances. Lock him up.

268
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,943
Come with me. No, thanks.

269
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:12,228
[grunts]

270
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:16,498
Security! We have an intruder on level 5!

271
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,205
Batman: Diana, I was right.

272
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:41,023
The Gordanians are nowhere near Earth.

273
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,625
The thanagarians are-- aah!

274
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,477
Batman! Come in! Can you hear me?

275
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,630
Keep an eye on this one.

276
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,999
Commander, our security has been breached.

277
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,733
I was hoping to avoid this.

278
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,920
Deploy our contingency forces now.

279
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:55,871
By your command.

280
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,516
Wonder Woman: Superman! The thanagarians are lying.

281
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,418
Batman's been captured aboard their command ship.

They're here at the Watchtower!

The landing bay's opening!

00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,295
They must have our access codes!

Aah!

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,428
Ugh! Ugh!

Talak: Can't let your friends jeopardize our mission.

It's a double-cross!

00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,424
Launch a full strike counterattack.

299

Don't fight us. We're trying to help you.

Do you ever stop lying?

318
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:29,445
It was for your own good.

You've got to trust me!
