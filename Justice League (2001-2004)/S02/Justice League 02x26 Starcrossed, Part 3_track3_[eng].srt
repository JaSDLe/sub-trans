1
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,482
Previously on "Justice League."

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,169
This is commander Hro Talak.

3
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:13,104
In the name of the thanagarian authority

4
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:15,256
We claim your planet as a garrison

5
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:17,626
And have instituted martial law.

6
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:22,714
It would have been difficult to storm their Watchtower

7
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:25,383
Without the access codes you provided.

8
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:27,285
But if we open a hole in hyperspace,

9
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,587
It will destroy this entire planet.

10
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,423
Sadly, yes.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,724
For Thanagar to live,

12
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,126
Earth must die.

13
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:36,761
The so-called Justice League

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,080
Is in violation of our marshal law.

15
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,266
They are to be considered an enemy

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,685
And dealt with on sight.

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,654
We've lost track of the Justice League.

18
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,922
They've blended with the populous.

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,608
It will be difficult to find them--

20
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:53,661
Unless, of course, you know where they are.

21
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,364
You've got a lot of nerve showing up here.

22
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,933
The situation is worse than you think.

23
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:01,202
I have a fix on their location.

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,753
This time...

25
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,889
They will not escape.

26
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,282
Captioning made possible by Warner bros.

27
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:21,866
Welcome back, lieutenant Hol.

28
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,519
You're in my way. Likewise, I'm sure.

29
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:25,970
Come with me.

30
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,672
I don't take orders from--

31
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,410
Construction is nearly complete.

32
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:35,747
The bypass generator will be operational within the hour.

33
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:37,248
Evacuate our troops.

34
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:40,034
I want the bypass activated as soon as it's ready.

35
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,078
[grunts]

36
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,930
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,231
I'm sorry, sir.

38
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,800
She's guilty of high treason,

39
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:57,669
Espionage, and consorting with the enemy.

40
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,545
They're building a hyperspace bypass.

41
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:09,013
When it's activated, it will destroy the planet

42
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,882
And everything on it.

43
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,418
Where did you get this?

44
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,190
From the holocam I planted on her.

45
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,074
Wait, it gets better.

46
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:22,160
I did what I thought was right then.

47
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:24,429
And that's what I'm doing now.

48
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,718
Hro...

49
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,519
Get her out of my sight.

50
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,442
Commander, I hated to be the one to tell you.

51
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:40,829
[grunts]

52
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:45,116
Assemble your strike force and deal with the leak.

53
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,052
This time, don't bother taking prisoners.

54
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,564
Ingenious.

55
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,582
Yeah, I'm impressed.

56
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,884
Let's go wreck it.

57
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,087
How? It's behind a force field.

58
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,589
Force field controlled from the command ship.

59
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,277
Go shut it down.

60
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:13,745
I'll take care of the generator.

61
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,080
That thing's the size of a city.

62
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:17,448
What are you gonna do, throw a batarang at it?

63
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:19,000
Something like that.

64
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:26,291
Good heavens!

65
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,193
[explosion]

66
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,935
[grunting]

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,772
Spread out.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,623
They're hiding here somewhere.

69
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,360
Uh-uh!

70
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,445
All through hiding.

71
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,699
Come and get some!

72
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:14,472
Hyah!

73
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,624
Oof!

74
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:21,312
[screaming]

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,931
Let's use our inside voice.

76
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:23,765
Oh!

77
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,866
Oof!

78
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,842
[grunting]

79
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,147
Tails, I win!

80
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,254
Your weapons are pitiful!

81
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:47,856
Wait for it.

82
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:52,210
[screeching]

83
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,146
[grunting]

84
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,468
Oof!

85
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:13,030
Let's go.

86
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,687
Mind the glass, sir.

87
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,822
I want you, Superman, and Wonder Woman

88
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,408
To go to the command ship and shut down the force field.

89
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,376
And the rest of us?

90
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:28,062
You're going to help me retake the Watchtower.

91
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,297
It's crawling with thanagarian soldiers.

92
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:31,882
How are you planning on getting inside?

93
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,034
With that.

94
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,338
Well?

95
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:40,175
I have no idea how to fly this vehicle.

96
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:41,392
What's this do?

97
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,327
[boom]

98
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:49,000
That's not helping.

99
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,235
I'll need one of the hawkmen.

100
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,239
You think I'd tell you anything?

101
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:58,242
I'd sooner choke on your bones.

102
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,911
Ok by me.

103
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,012
Start with these.

104
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,480
We're running out of time.

105
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,115
I'll take the information from him.

106
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:06,935
I thought you couldn't read their minds.

107
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:10,221
I'll just have to try harder.

108
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,589
[screeching]

109
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,909
Ow! J'onn!

[screaming]

113
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,298
Ugh!

114
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,169
I have what we need.

115
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:44,286
I've asked master Bruce to refrain from leaving trash in the yard.

116
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:57,694
Why, Shayera?

117
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,380
Why would you do this?

118
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:01,198
I'm trying to save lives.

119
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,516
So am I.

120
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,385
Tens of billions of thanagarians.

121
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,786
So we trade the humans' lives for our own?

122
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,788
War makes for hard choices, lieutenant.

123
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:10,524
It's them or us.

124
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,792
The man I fell in love with

125
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:13,360
Would have found another way.

126
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,095
Are you talking about me,

127
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,263
Or Green Lantern?

128
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,336
I didn't want to believe it.

129
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,304
Shayera, I love you.

130
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:26,073
I can forgive your treason.

131
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:27,691
I can forgive everything.

132
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:30,027
Make this all go away.

133
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,845
Just tell me what I need to hear.

134
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:33,547
It was a meaningless flirtation.

135
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,781
You were lonely.

136
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,784
Tell me I'm the one you love, not him!

137
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,820
If you want me, I'm yours.

138
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,989
All you have to do is spare the Earth.

139
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:47,511
Perhaps you'll forget him once Earth is nothing but a memory.

140
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,861
Shuttle Epsilon 16 requesting entry.

141
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,462
Confirm docking code.

142
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,548
Docking code confirmed.

143
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,533
You are cleared to come aboard.

144
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,159
We weren't expecting you, sir.

145
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,511
There's been a change in plans.

146

Oof!

150
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:39,697
Commander, the Justice League is approaching.

151
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,999
Kragger's strike squad has failed.

152
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,717
Launch interceptors.

153
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:48,054
Pretty bad odds.

154
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,339
Yeah.

155
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,225
They don't stand a chance.

156
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,257
Ok. The Watchtower's ours again.

157
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,944
So, where's your secret weapon?

158
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,212
You're standing in it.

159
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:14,682
Wait.

160
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:15,632
You mean we're gonna--

161
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,368
Take the Watchtower out of orbit

162
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:20,137
And drop it right on top of their little science project.

163
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:21,988
Get them to the escape pods.

164
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,368
Is that the last of them?

165
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,236
Yeah, the tower's completely pest-free.

166
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,288
Good.

167
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:40,340
Hey!

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,508
What are you doing?

169
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,793
Can't risk having the Watchtower

170
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,295
Burn up on reentry.

171
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:46,246
I'll have to guide it in manually.

172
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,816
Gentlemen, it's been an honor.

173

All available security forces to engineering deck!

176
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:18,812
Belay that!

177
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,181
Green Lantern is mine.

I should leave you to burn.

184
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,942
The force field control is over here.

185
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,784
That is what you came for, yes?

186
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,985
You want it,

187
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:34,304
All you have to do is get by me.

188
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:36,723
It'll be a pleasure.

189
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,975
No-- this won't be like the last time

190
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:40,677
You took something that belonged to me.

191
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:43,047
Anything I took was freely offered.

192
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,816
Maybe you should take better care of your stuff.

Any last words?

00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,315
Yeah, you can kiss my ax.

The fight's over.

205

You're a soldier, not a murderer.

206
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,673
I'm a fool...

207
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,308
For ever loving you.

208
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,064
It didn't have to be this way.

209
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,482
Yes...

210
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,217
It did.

We're cutting it a little close.

213
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,813
Have you shut off the force field?

214
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:41,498
Not yet. Where are you?

215
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,401
Aboard the Watchtower, guiding it to target.

216
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:46,236
That's insane! Get out of there!

217
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:48,655
Negative. I'm staying with it.

Was he worth it?

This isn't about him,

221
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,463
It's about us.

222
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:15,315
Don't kill these innocent people, Hro.

223
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,034
Find another way.

[grunting]

227
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,520
Just a fallen traitor

228

And a soldier with a job to do.

229
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:40,874
She won't save you again, Lantern.

230
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,760
No woman's skirt to hide behind.

231
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,060
No ring.

232
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,763
What are you going to do now?

233
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,266
I was thinking of introducing you to my friend here!

234
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:05,549
All construction personnel now en route to mother ship.

235

Good.

My grandma hits harder than you.

No!

241
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,899
Always have to be the hero, don't you?

00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,219

Lower your weapons.

247

Commander?

248
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,616
Our mission is a failure.

249
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,134
There's no more reason to fight.

250
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,085
Let them go.

251
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:26,923
I hope you're pleased with yourself.

252
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:29,793
It will take years for us to rebuild elsewhere.

253
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,395
Then you'd better get started.

254

This is Snapper Carr reporting.

00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,076
In a stunning turn of events,

256
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,812
The thanagarian forces have ended their occupation of Earth,

257
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,730
Departing for locations unknown.

258
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:53,216
Once again, the world owes a debt of gratitude

259
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:56,553
to the selfless heroism of the Justice League.

Yes, miss, they have.

263
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,525
If I may be so bold,

264
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:05,595
I'm neither a superhero nor a soldier,

265
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:09,132
So I'm hardly qualified to judge your actions by those standards.

266
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,484
But I do know this:

267
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,620
Without the great sacrifices you've made

268
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:16,989
We wouldn't be here to share this nice pot of tea.

Whatever they decide in that room,

270
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,765
In my eyes, you'll always be a hero.

271
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:34,458
She exploited our weaknesses,

272
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,592

Come on!

274
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,928
She was in the ultimate no-win situation.

275
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,163
But when push came to shove,

276
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,298
She came through for us, just like always.

277
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,201
She's a pariah to her people.

278
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,236
We're all she has left.

279
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:47,420
Believe me, J’onn,

280
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:49,222
I feel for her,

281
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:50,724
But after everything that's happened

282
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:56,429
I honestly don't know if I could ever completely trust her again.

283
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:58,181
We're arguing in circles.

284
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:00,099
It's time to take a vote.

285
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,991
They've sent for you, miss.

286
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,659
Thank you, Alfred.

287
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,449
Hawkgirl--

288
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:19,419
Before you start, I have something to say...

289
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,771
I came to this planet as a patriot.

290
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,074
I had a mission, and I carried it out.

291
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:27,494
What I couldn't know was that I would come to care for the Earth

292
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:28,894
And her people--

293
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,896
That I've come to care for all of you.

294
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:34,084
I've spent the last 5 years torn between my feelings

295
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:35,151
And my duty.

296
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:37,053
I won't ask you to do the same.

297
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,456
Therefore I am resigning from the Justice League,

298
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,441
Effective immediately.

299
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:57,941
Great.

300
00:21:58,008 --> 00:21:59,609
No Hawkgirl, no Javelin,

301
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:00,910
No Watchtower.

302
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:02,445
What's gonna happen to the League now?

303
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,114
Do we all just walk away?

304
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,865
No, we rebuild,

305
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,534
Starting today.

306
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:08,684
J'onn's right.

307
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:10,286
Earth still needs us,

308
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:11,954
And we'll never let her down.

309
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:13,656
It's our duty.

310
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:26,502
You never asked how we voted.

311
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,854
It doesn't matter.

312
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:31,207
So, where are you gonna go?

313
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,610
I don't know.

314
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,479
Someplace where the fate of the world

315
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:36,546
Isn't in my hands,

316
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:39,082
Someplace where there are no more secrets,

317
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,284
No more lies.

318
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:43,069
Was it all a lie?

319
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,739
I love you, John.

320
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,892
I never lied about that.

321
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,207
I love you, too.
