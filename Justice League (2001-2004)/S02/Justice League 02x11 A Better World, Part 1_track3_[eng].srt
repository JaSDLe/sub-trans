Almost there. What about you two?

00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:19,381
Man: Oof!

00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,583

00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,152
I'll catch up in a minute.

00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,286
Wait for me.

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:31,193
Uh! Uh!

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,396
Wonder Woman, over radio: Superman!

10
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:37,465
Can you hear me? Wait!

11
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,734
We've waited too long as it is.

12
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:46,741
They couldn't see the beauty. No imagination.

13
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:48,343
They'd rather fight.

14
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,416
Even this wasn't enough for you, was it?

15
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:55,951
You had to have it all.

16
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:57,386
Now we're on the brink of a war

17
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:58,820
That could destroy the whole planet.

18
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:02,190
Could have been so perfect. Paradise.

19
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:05,293
And I let it get this far because of the law...

20
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:06,794
And the will of the people.

21
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:09,831
<i>Ha ha, the people? This is all their fault!</i>

22
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,232
And they're going to burn for it.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,567
Burn!

24
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:15,169
You're nothing but a mad dog now, aren't you?

25
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,572
Ooh! A threat!

26
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:20,842
But this old dog still has a few teeth.

27
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:27,749
There are at least 6 different ways I can stop you right now.

28
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,086
But they all involve deadly force, don't they?

29
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,721
And you don't do that.

30
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,558
No, you need me.

31
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,760
You wouldn't be much of a hero without a villain,

32
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:41,063
And you do love being the hero, don't you?

33
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,564
The cheering children, the swooning women.

34
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:47,902
You love it so much it's made you my most reliable accomplice.

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,038
Accomplice? What are you--

36
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,107
You could have crushed me anytime you wanted,

37
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:55,743
And it wasn't the law or the will of the people that stopped you.

38
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:59,981
It was your ego. Being a hero was too important to you.

39
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,617
You're as much responsible for this as I am.

40
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:04,719
So, go ahead, fix it somehow,

41
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:08,022
Put me on trial, lock me up, but I'll beat it.

42
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,893
And then we'll start the whole thing all over again.

43
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,630
I did love being a hero,

44
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:19,868
But if this is where it leads, I'm done with it.

51
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:51,099
Well, it had to be done.

Are you ok?

53
00:03:01,844 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm great.

Sector 42-- report delayed.

61
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,750
Why the delay in sector 42?

62
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:53,321
A storm.

63
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,256
Is there anything we can do?

64
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:57,091
No, everyone's been evacuated.

65

Oh.

66
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,163
Let's continue, then.

69
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,235
Second man: Sector 35-- all clear.

70
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:09,871
I'm sorry. We can't allow it right now.

71
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,239
You're just not ready.

72
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,641
But it's kind of a fall tradition, you know?

73
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,443
Like Halloween and football.

74
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,245
Folks aren't gonna be too happy.

75
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:18,746
They seem happy enough to me.

76
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:21,116
And an election isn't like football.

77
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,684
There's a lot more to lose.

78
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,185
True enough.

79
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:26,554
So when do you think might be a good time to have one?

80
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:29,523
Patience, Mr. President. Patience.

81
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:48,243
I keep expecting him to come zipping in any minute.

82
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,645
And then say something really stupid, right?

83
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,546
Well, there was that.

84
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:55,083
But when things got serious, so did he.

Just a small protest at the college.

We're there.

91
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,038
Not necessary.

You're sure you don't want to help us out?

Since when does that matter to you?

170
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:53,788
No leaving the premises, no unauthorized guests, no phone calls.

171
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:56,525
Can't speak my mind, can't think.

172
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:57,358
It's only temporary, ma'am.

173
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:59,927
They gave us their word.

174
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:02,130
Sucker.

175
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,435
Green Lantern: What is this?

176
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:08,836
Some old video of us?

177
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,905
Except we never had a fight like this with Luthor.

178
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:11,773
Batman: You're right.

179
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,341
<i>We never did.</i>

180
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:15,443
But they're having one... Right now.

181
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,412
They?

182
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,181
We're looking at another dimension.

183
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,548
Live.

184
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,817
It's just like ours. Almost.

185
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:25,220
But their Flash is still alive.

186
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:26,721
So's their Luthor.

187
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,757
There's something else.

188
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:32,360
They don't call themselves the Justice Lords.

189
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:35,097
<i>They're the Justice League.</i>

190
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,601
It's sad.

191
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,138
Yeah. Their world's the mess ours used to be.

192
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,639
Too bad we can't help them.

193
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,141
Who says we can't?

194
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,886
You've been a busy little bat, haven't you?

195
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:01,222
What else is there to do around here anymore?

196
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:06,928
This can take us into that other dimension.

197
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,663
If we decide to use it.

198
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,631
Why wouldn't we?

199
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:11,432
You're talking about helping them.

200
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,101
But would they accept it?

201
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,537
Our kind of help.

202
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:39,561
Ugh!

203
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,202
Don't take your eyes off him, I said.

204
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,604
Not even for a second.

205
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,706
Hey, I had to go, ok?

206
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:52,807
And there's some things I just can't do

207
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,676
In the blink of an eye.

208
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:07,322
What is that?

209
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,190
Breakable, I hope.

210
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,994
Oh! Oh! Uh!

211
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,697
Ooh!

212
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:20,035
Watch. I'll be out in days.

213
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:22,304
Not with a broken leg, you won't.

214
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:35,417
Sorry I messed up back there.

215
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,985
Apology accepted...

216
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,753
As soon as the damage is fixed.

217
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,221
Got a sec?

218
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,834
Who-- who are you?

219
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,404
I'm you.

220
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,107
And the dimensions appear to be

221
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:01,942
Collapsing on each other.

222
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,511
Our Batman built this portal

223
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,379
To try to find help.

224
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,647
But what can we do?

225
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:07,182
We're not sure yet.

226
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:09,017
But my dimension seems to be at the center of it,

227
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,518
And that would be the best place

228
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:11,753
To start looking for an answer.

229
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,822
Have you read his mind yet?

230
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:16,491
Martians don't do that to one another.

231
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:20,194
Can't... or won't? - Both.

232
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,630
So it's agreed, then. We go?

233
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:24,765
Sure. Ok. Right.

234
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,267
Let's do it. I'm in.

235
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:27,435
J'onn? Batman?

236
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,370
Agreed.

237
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,382
Hey, don't you guys believe

238
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,917
In doors and windows?

239
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:44,485
I'm sorry.

[screams]

00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:55,230
They'll thank us later.

00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,331
Uh-oh.

Of the special crimes unit,

252
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:43,037
So far, the creature has proved unstoppable.

253
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:44,806
The question everyone's asking is,

254
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,842
Where is the Justice League?

255
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:48,843
Hold on, Janet.

256
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:51,212
We're now getting unconfirmed reports

257
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,313
That the president is considering a unilat--

258
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:53,380
Look at that thing.

[growls]

260
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:57,718
You wanted excitement.

261
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:00,288
And when we stop it, they'll be so grateful,

262
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,357
They'll roll right over for us.

263
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,158
<i>If we can stop it.</i>

264

Whoo!

271
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,776
So, Larry, how are the wife and kids?

272
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,177
Fine, Mr. Luthor.

273
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,446
And they love that big-screen TV.

274
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:40,547
They'll love their new S.U.V. Even more.

275
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:51,292
20 bucks on the ugly guy.

00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,760
Watch out!

00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:58,532
Uh!

278
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:04,639
What do you want?

279
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,811
Same as you, I imagine.

Control.

282
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,249
But I had to see the best this planet had to offer.

283
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,218
I am not impressed.

284
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:28,362
Aargh.

285
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:36,971

What happened to that creature?

00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:33,828
What happened?

299
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:34,962
Any comment?

You... Lobotomized him.

What's your question, Lois?

It's-- it's so out of character.

It's about time, if you ask me.

Yeah, right. Absolutely. Yeah.

305

And what's with the new costumes, guys?

Where's the Flash?

309
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:02,256
It's not them.
