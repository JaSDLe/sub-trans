Hello?

[beep beep] Superman to Justice League.

Looks like we've somehow been transported to a planet with a red sun.

My powers aren't working.

I'm picking up your homing beacon, but I'm not getting audio.

I'll leave this channel open and attempt to move closer to your position.

We're very close to each other.

00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,536
What happened to everybody?

80
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,521
Man: They died, Superman.

81
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,490
Thousands of years ago.

82
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:32,701
They don't build them like this anymore.

83
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,802
What?

84
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:36,004
It didn't lose orbit until only 75 years ago.

85
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,622
Remarkable feat of engineering.

86
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,424
What happened here?

87
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:41,176
I think you've already guessed.

88
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:42,493
This is Earth.

89
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:43,595
Yes.

90
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,263
Thousands of years in your future.

91
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,366
That simpleton Toyman never truly understood what he had created.

92
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,802
The disintegrator beam he hit me with...

93
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,938
An energized tacchian stream.

94
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,906
That's what sent you into the future.

95
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:57,692
Hello.

96
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,396
How'd you get here?

97
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:03,198
The old-fashioned way.

98
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,666
I'm immortal.

99
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,702
I'm the sole remaining survivor of the human race.

100
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,103
All the people? Gone.

101
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,173
The Earth belongs to the cockroaches now.

102
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,408
Oh, and me.

103
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:17,829
I picked up your comm signal a few weeks ago.

104
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:19,481
I used it to track you down.

105
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,383
You could have just called!

106
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,218
I was afraid you might be holding a grudge.

107
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,220
If you'd switched off, I might never have found you.

108
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,387
Grudge?

109
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:29,774
You tried to take over the world...Twice.

110
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,476
In the long run, not so important.

111
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:33,411
Take it from someone who knows.

112
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,148
You're insane.

113
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:38,517
True. But that doesn't mean I'm not good company.

114
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:41,219
Say, you want to come over to my house?

115
00:11:43,523 --> 00:11:45,874
Like you've got something better to do.

116
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,768
Before we go inside, I want you to see this.

117
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:58,153
This is Metropolis.

118
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:00,705
Was. I restored it myself.

119
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:03,225
Archaeology is one of my hobbies.

120
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:13,484
Your funeral was lovely.

121
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:15,153
It was on all the networks.

122
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,387
I used to have the DVD.

123
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:18,089
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

124
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:19,724
As a matter of fact, I did.

125
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,110
But I've had 30,000 years to reconsider.

126
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:25,914
It took you that long to figure out that you're a power-mad despot?

127
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,783
It took me that long to figure out that my lust

128
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,818
For power and control was meaningless.

129
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,219
I don't know what kind of con

130
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:32,704
You're trying to run on me,

131
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,239
But you're wasting your time.

132
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:35,940
I should never have done it.

133
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,742
Done what?

134
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,810
This.

135
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:42,381
I destroyed the world.

136
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,115
It was only a few months after you disappeared.

137
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,484
I had just perfected an invention

138
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:48,503
That gave me total control over gravity.

139
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,755
I proclaimed myself master of the world.

140
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:52,924
The Justice League would never have allowed that.

141
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:55,293
True. They put up quite a fight.

142
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,229
Green Lantern was the most difficult.

143
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,580
I killed him right here.

144
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:04,536
No... It was over there.

145
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:07,805
In any case, I destroyed the entire Justice League that day.

146
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:09,541
But that wasn't all.

147
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,759
My newfound powers disrupted

148
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:13,462
The gravitational balance of the entire solar system.

149
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,729
This is the result.

150
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,416
Ugh!

151
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,253
Oh!

152
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:24,005
Ha!

153
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:28,126
I should smash your skull.

154
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,762
Go ahead. We both know it wouldn't work.

155
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,932
Aaugh!

156
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,607
What now?

157
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,127
Lunch.

158
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:51,232
Sorry about the mess. I tried to tidy up a bit.

159
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,825
Superman: You did all this?

160
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:03,427
Savage: Every bit. I've had a long time to tinker.

161
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,830
You have to keep busy, or you'll go mad.

162
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,806
Self-help books. You don't seem the type.

163
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,624
I read whatever I can find.

164
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,593
Anyway, I've got issues.

165
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,962
What with my destroying the Earth and all.

166
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,416
Hope you're hungry.

167
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:26,718
Like it?

168
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:27,969
I grew all the food myself.

169
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,056
House, garden view.

170
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,809
Some garden.

171
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:35,960
I spent quite a lot of time

172
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:38,130
Rediscovering the principles of agriculture.

173
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,981
Something to do.

174
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,883
Like the rocket ship, I suppose.

175
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,218
Star ship.

176
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:44,402
I'd intended to leave the Earth

177
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,321
And search the universe for other life,

178
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:47,989
But I never did.

179
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,290
Too difficult?

180
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:53,111
Not at all. I decided I deserved to be punished.

181
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,119
Savage!

182
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,140
Savage, wake up!

183
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,741
What? What is it?

184
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,927
You've got a time machine!

185
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:28,079
I spent several decades working on it.

186
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:29,747
Then I lost interest.

187
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:31,850
Why didn't you finish it?

188
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:33,718
No attention span, I suppose.

189
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,220
No point, either.

190
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,389
There is a point. Don't you see?

191
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:39,124
You could go back and stop yourself

192
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:40,758
From destroying the world.

193
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:42,394
No, I couldn't

194
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:44,095
This design doesn't allow me to travel

195
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,648
Back to any time where I already exist.

196
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:49,367
Yeah, but I'm already dead.

197
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:55,507
On your feet, Mr. Wizard. We've got work to do.

198
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:09,754
It's not working.

199
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,522
It's working perfectly.

200
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,708
We just don't have sufficient power to keep it open.

201
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:17,479
You told me this place was powered by its own hydroelectric dam.

202
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:18,480
10 dams wouldn't be enough

203
00:16:18,547 --> 00:16:21,016
To open a time warp for more than a few seconds.

204
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,334
I take you've got something in mind.

205
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,739
About 30 years ago some of the roach creatures

206
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:31,208
Broke in and stole my zero point generator.

207
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:32,360
It's the only power source in the world

208
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:34,462
Capable of running my time machine.

209
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,247
Can't you just build another one?

210
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,451
I'm working on it. I'll be finished in another 50 years.

211
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:40,518
Care to wait?

212
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,974
Superman: What do the roaches want with a power cell?

213
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:50,161
For all intents and purposes it's a miniature sun.

214
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,797
They use it to provide warmth to their central mound.

215
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:54,232
We go on foot from here.

216
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,533
This is gonna be fun.

217
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,436
Trust me, it isn't.

218
00:16:58,504 --> 00:16:59,437
Ah!

219
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,455
[roaring]

220
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,789
[footsteps]

221
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:38,943
[roaring]

222
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:45,817
So much for stealth. They know we're here.

223
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,157
Haa!

224
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:53,625
Aah!

225
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,378
Go! Go!

226
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:29,177
Look out!

227
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:32,213
Aah!

228
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,401
Superman! Aah!

229
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:39,988
[triumphant music]

230
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:56,788
You know, I suspected the radiation

231
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:58,740
From the device might restore your powers.

232
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:01,242
But I didn't want to needlessly raise your hopes...

233
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,693
Or mine.

234
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:10,134
You're ready to send me back?

235
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:13,971
No. But I will, anyway.

236
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,758
You have to stop me by any means necessary.

237
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:18,559
I promise.

238
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:20,061
4 days from your arrival,

239
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,630
My younger self will steal a piece of dwarf star matter

240
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,265
From a scientist named Ray Palmer.

241
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,516
If you prevent that theft,

242
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,735
I'll never be able to build my weapon.

243
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:29,970
Ray Palmer. Got it.

244
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,375
What happens to you?

245
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:38,613
Redemption, if I'm lucky. Don't worry about me.

246
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:41,182
Return to your friends. Do what you do best...

247
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,201
What you were born to do:

248
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,119
Save the world.

249
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,878
Say it. Say it.

250
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,679
Uncle.

251
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:16,600
I can't hear you.

252
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:21,322
He's beaten. Put the car down.

253
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,576
I was gonna.

254
00:20:25,644 --> 00:20:27,495
Pretty good, huh?

255
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:28,512
When you got Lobo on your team,

256
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,415
Who needs Superman?

257
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,756
Bang. You're dead.

258
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:46,764
Aah!

259
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,340
Superman!

260
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:56,440
You're alive!

261
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:58,993
Are you ok? I don't believe it.

262
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:01,863
I'm fine. Very glad to be home.

263
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:02,931
Flash?

264
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,432
[sniffling]

265
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,767
Something in my eyes.

266
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:07,234
Yeah. Tears.

267
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:10,405
It's ok, man. We all feel the same way.

268
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:13,358
Superman, how can you be...

269
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,492
Alive?

270
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,227
Toyman sent me to the future.

271
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:18,045
Then Vandal Savage and I

272
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:20,598
Fought some giant cockroaches and...

273
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,034
It's complicated.

274
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,019
I love the beard. Keeping it?

275
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:26,955
Not a chance.

276
00:21:26,957 --> 00:21:28,957
You were greatly missed, my friend,

277
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,408
By all of us.

278
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:33,728
Don't let him fool you.

279
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,663
Your death hit him as hard as it did any of us.

280
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,265
Really?

281
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:40,151
No. I never believed you were dead in the first place.

282
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,487
I guess that's sort of a compliment.

283
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:43,671
Ain't this great?

284
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:47,125
The whole team together again. All 8 of us.

285
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:49,477
Count again. You're fired.

286
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:50,461
What?

287
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,881
You're not Justice League material, Lobo.

288
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:54,616
Go chase a bail jumper.

289
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,834
I don't care what you do, just clear out.

290
00:21:56,902 --> 00:22:00,355
This is the thanks I get? What a stinkin' rip.

291
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:03,841
Next time you lollipops need help,

292
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,210
Don't bother askin' the main man!

293
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,898
We didn't ask you this time!

294
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,550
Guess you'll want to get cleaned up

295
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:14,219
And find a new set of clothes.

296
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,704
Not yet. We've got a job to do.

297
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,706
Come on, I'll explain on the way.

298
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:56,394
Thank you, my friend.
