173
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:01,587
And it never would have been able to lay a glove on me.

174
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:03,206
When have I heard that before?

175
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:04,339
Hey!

176
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:05,824
They're making a good point.

177
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,526
You've got to trust your partners.

178
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,394
I do, but the fact is,

179
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:11,030
I'm the invulnerable one.

180
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:13,649
Every punch I take is a punch they don't have to.

181
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,551
Are you saying we can't cut it?

182
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:17,620
That's what it sounds like to me.

183
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,355
Now hold on. We're a team.

184
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:20,556
But we're not all equal.

185
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:21,857
You can't deny that--

186
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:23,592
Everybody, knock it off!

187
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,095
We're going to keep doing this till we get it right.

188
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,485
Should have used your heat vision.

189
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,544
But nothing appears to have been stolen from the island.

190
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,695
Police have called in a HAZMA-T team

191
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:49,184
To investigate 4 mysterious empty canisters found at the scene.

192
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,456
What kind of guy would lock somebody up

193
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:56,558
and keep him as if he was property?

194
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,427
Edge was sick, honey.

195
00:15:58,494 --> 00:16:00,362
But you don't have to worry about him anymore.

196
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,264
Nobody has to.

197
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:04,333
I'm grateful to you. Don't get me wrong.

198
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:07,019
But I'm not really one of you.

199
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,738
See, all I want is to be normal again.

200
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,673
And give up all your power?

201
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,926
I can offer you the best of both worlds.

202
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,410
Yeah, right.

203
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:16,912
This is Giganta.

204
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,547
She was a lovely child,

205
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,517
Don't you think?

206
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:33,162
If I could do that for her,

207
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,581
Think what I can do for you.

208
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,254
[man and woman speaking spanish]

209
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:53,466
Uh... Ah!

210
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:55,183
[speaking spanish]

211
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:16,455
Aah!

212
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:19,358
Always trying to find a cure, aren't you?

213
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,310
Can you blame me?

214
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:24,279
No, but it's made you predictable.

215
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:28,651
This is the only company in the world that makes what you need.

216
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,968
Now, where's Shade?

217
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:33,221
Over there.

218
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:45,801
You didn't think I'd come here

219
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,436
Without reinforcements, did you?

220
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,354
Wish I'd thought of that.

221
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,441
Oh, wait. I did.

222
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:56,795
I'll take the big one.

223
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,097
I'll take her.

224
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:29,661
Aah!

225
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:36,551
John!

226
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:57,465
Come on!

227
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,177
Why didn't you let us finish them?

228
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:26,962
In a warehouse?

229
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,098
That's far too small a stage.

230
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:36,405
It was 7 to 6. We had the advantage.

231
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,140
Where'd you go? I was counting on you.

232
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,925
Lantern was hurt,

233
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,210
And I recall you saying

234
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:43,128
That you could take her.

235
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:45,364
So much for practice makes perfect.

236
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,066
I thought we were practicing teamwork,

237
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,735
Not one guys tells everybody else what to do.

238
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:51,337
Somebody has to be in charge,

239
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:52,954
And it couldn't very well be you.

240
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:54,456
You know, I'm getting really sick of--

241
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:56,392
Will you both shut up?

242
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:58,126
I've had better luck handling whole armies,

243
00:20:58,194 --> 00:20:59,629
And you know why?

244
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:02,164
Because I didn't have to worry about anyone but myself.

245
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,899
Then why don't you go back to that?

246
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,718
You think I haven't considered it?

247
00:21:07,304 --> 00:21:09,171
This whole stinking group was your idea,

248
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:11,106
And now you don't want to do it anymore?

249
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,192
You men. Unless you do it on your own,

250
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:14,744
It doesn't count.

251
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,579
It's not just the men, you stuck-up--

252
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,598
Stop it! Stop it right now!

253
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:21,584
I arrived here not knowing a soul,

254
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:23,652
and you took me in.

255
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,288
You became my new family.

256
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:27,990
But what's the use of a family

257
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,359
If it diminishes us as individuals?

258
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:33,278
Well... What are you...

259
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:36,215
I'm saying I survived the loss of one family,

260
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:39,919
And I'll survive this one, too.
