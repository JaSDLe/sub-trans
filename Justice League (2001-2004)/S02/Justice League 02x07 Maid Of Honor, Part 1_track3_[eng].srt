00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,587
Bonsoir, Wonder Woman!

00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,473
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur.</i>

3
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,392
Man: Who is she?

4
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:46,493
It's Wonder Woman.

5
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:47,677
Wonder Woman?

6
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,129
Look! It's Wonder Woman!

00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,131
[whispering and chattering]

8
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,670
What is it like working with Superman?

9
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,705
When you fought the aliens, were you scared?

10
00:00:58,707 --> 00:00:59,939
Um...

11
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,824
Are you really from an island with no men?

12
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:02,959
I...

13
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,593
Man: May I have this dance?

14
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:06,213
Yes!

15
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,502
Thank you, mister...

16
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,471
Wayne. Bruce Wayne.

17
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:15,822
I appreciate the rescue.

18
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:18,941
I'm surprised to see you here.

19
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:19,976
From what I've heard,

20
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,545
This isn't really your sort of affair.

21
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:23,680
I've decided to get out more, have a little fun.

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,133
Enjoying yourself so far?

23
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:28,601
More than I expected

24
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,103
How about you?

25
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:32,138
What brings you to the city of lights?

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,474
I never miss a good party.

27
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:36,576
I may also have to attend to some business while I'm in town.

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,980
Princess Audrey,

29
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,249
May I take your picture?

30
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:47,287
Absolutely! So long as you're in it with me!

31
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,672
Big smile!

32
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,089
Ah!

33
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:52,992
Can I have your autograph?

34
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:55,595
You just got it, darling.

35
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:57,430

[helicopter]

38
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:06,589
Down with the monarchy! Freedom for Kasnia!

39
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,758
Oof! Unh!

40
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,445
Stay back!

41
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:12,996
You can't approach without my permission!

42
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:15,681
Permission, yes?

43
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,153
Do what we say and you won't be harmed.

44
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,721
I have the princess! Clear!

45
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:22,722
Oh!

46
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:27,193
Excuse me. Excuse me.

47
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,634
Aah!

48
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,668
Always this popular?

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,186
Yes.

50
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:39,071
Although my admirers are usually unarmed.

Unh!

53
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:06,299
What happened? Where's the princess?

54
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,567
Forget her!

55
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,269
We've got to get out of here before Wonder Woman--

56
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,270
[knock knock]

57
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:13,823
You give up, right?

58
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,645
That was fabulous!

59
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,897
I've never seen anyone break a helicopter before!

60
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,299
It was my first time.

61
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,350
Well, I can't thank you enough.

62
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:32,919
I'm supposed to have guards

63
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,037
For this sort of thing, you know.

64
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,155
I wouldn't blame them.

65
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,308
Someone went to a lot of trouble to get to you.

66
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,892
Any ideas?

67
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:42,112
I am the princess of Kasnia.

68
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,515
Lots of people in the world don't like Kasnia.

69
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,450
Lots of people in Kasnia don't like Kasnia.

70
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,085
Tell me what you know.

71
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,287
Not tonight, darling. Still early.

72
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,189
Places to go, parties to crash.

On the other hand,

76
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,779
I've never hung out with a superhero before.

77
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:01,347
Excuse me. Hello?

78
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:02,415
I just heard the news.

79
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,600
Did they harm you?

80
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,985
I'm fine, daddy!

81
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:06,853
They won't get away with this.

82
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,305
I'll have the entire opposition party arrested.

83
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,074
Daddy, no! That's gauche!

84
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,875
We have to prove we're better than that.

85
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:15,595
I will not allow these dissidents to ruin

86
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:16,880
The International Space Station.

87
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,781
You are to return home immediately!

88
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:21,534
Let me stay. I couldn't be any safer.

89
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,018
Wonder Woman will be with me.

90
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,224
All right.

91
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,309
But I'm doubling your guard.

92
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,277
Take care, precious.

93
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,717
We need to get you some new clothes.

94
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,185
I know a boutique that will open for me

95
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,437
If I ask them nicely.

96
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,488
I thought you were going to tell me more

97
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,722
About the incident.

98
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:45,574
No, that's just what I let my father think

99
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:47,043
So I could go clubbing tonight.

100
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,111
Clubbing?

101
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:50,613
Look, I'm getting married soon.

102
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:53,282
This is my last night in Paris as a free woman.

103
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:54,534
I'm not really following.

104
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:56,836
I'm a world-class party girl.

105
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,588
I intend to go out with a bang...

106
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,423
Several, if it can be arranged.

107
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,626
You coming?

108
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:17,573
[thudding]

109

Ah!

00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,264
[coughing]

113
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:22,972
Oh...

114
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,657
Who are you working for?

115
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:53,302
Colonel Vox, we've obtained the targeting device.

116
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,394
[computerized voice] you don't seem very happy about it.

117
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:04,447
We lost one of our men.

118
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,515
Batman again?

119
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,000
He's getting very close.

120
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:07,900
He couldn't know our plan.

121
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,035
He's just guessing. He--

122
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,554
Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking!

123
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,256
I'd hate to have to raise my voice.

124
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:14,707
Sorry, sir.

125
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:15,725
Still, you're right.

126
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,993
Almost everything's in place.

127
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,912
Batman can't stop the plan.

128
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:23,199
Even the Justice League can't stop it now.

129
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,627
I hate to admit it, but you're right.

130
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,561
You're going to help me find out

131
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:36,696
Why those men tried to kidnap you?

132
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,814
I meant about the dress.

133
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,516
<i>You can get away with scarlet.</i>

134
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,835
I'm serious.

135
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,537
You're still in danger. Let me help.

136
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,089
You are helping.

137
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,290
I'm having a fabulous time.

138
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,525
Audrey.

139
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:50,843
I don't know.

140
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:53,446
A lot of people are upset about all the money

141
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,315
We're putting into the International Space Station.

142
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,099
That project's making your father

143
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,768
A very popular world leader.

144
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,053
Someone forgot to tell that to the peasants back home.

145
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:03,956
Anyway, it's my fiancé who's really running the thing.

146
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,008
You haven't said much about him.

147
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,176
What's to say?

148
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:10,112
Arranged marriage to a dreary, much older man.

149
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,046
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,131
<i>Moi aussi.</i>

151
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,550
<i>But my new life as royal hausfrau</i>

152
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:17,620
Doesn't begin until after the engagement party tomorrow.

153
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:18,737
Tonight, we dance.

154
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,107
I doubt they'll approve.

155
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:25,494
As if they have any say.

156
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:29,082
Excuse me, boys. Girl talk.

157
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,933
I've been ditching royal guards

158
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,335
Since I was knee-high to daddy's throne.

159
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:33,286
Try and keep up.

160
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:40,159
Audrey: Taxi, s'il vous plait!

161

Look at the line! We'll never get in.

166
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,409
Ah, but you forget, you're with me.

167
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,718
You know who I am, of course.

168
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,837
Yes, you're with Wonder Woman!

169
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,640
Who is that with princess Audrey?

170
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,242
He says it's Wonder Woman.

171
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,309
Woman: Is that Wonder Woman?

172

Look what I found! Party favors!

177
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:00,956
Nice.

178

You want a couple of them?

00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,059
We can go to the V.I.P. Room.

Would you be a dear and pummel them mercilessly?

Ah!

I don't think that'll be necessary.

You couldn't have had this much fun, darling.

This wasn't how I intended to spend

My last night as a free woman.

Disappointed? No.

200
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:56,061
I rather enjoyed corrupting you.

I'd appreciate it if we kept

Some of the more embarrassing stories to ourselves.

Don't worry-- I won't tell anyone

That their great hero has feet of clay.

You have no idea.

I'm sometimes afraid I'll never have fun again.

You don't have to marry him.

Ahh...I was thinking we should call it a night.

Not especially. But I do read the papers.

00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:05,964
Your point?

220
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,233
You've been running in rarefied circles.

I thought you should know some of those people

222
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:12,021
Aren't always what they appear to be.

223

If you're talking about princess Audrey,

224

She's a sweet girl.

Spoiled rotten, but sweet.

Several hours ago, I captured a burglar.

So?

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,337
He's a Kasnian special forces officer.

231
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,990
I don't believe Audrey would knowingly be involved

232
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,108
In anything like that.

233
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,130
But it wouldn't hurt to ask her.

Relax, Diana.

And churn out a veritable litter of royal heirs.

I don't know your father.

Well, I do,

And he wouldn't.

Nothing to be sorry about.

It's understandable.

My grandfather was a very evil man.

He wasn't a man. He was a monster.

I've dedicated my life to doing good works.

It's my way of trying to restore my family's lost honor.

The resemblance is uncanny.

Our genes are rather... Insistent.

Didn't you?

00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:32,160
Excellent.

Keep me informed. The--

279
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:39,401
Meaning?

280
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,469
Your grandfather was a munitions maker.

281
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:44,039
Ahead of his time in many ways.

282
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,673
I hope that doesn't also run in the family.

283
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:46,758
It doesn't.

284
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,494
Kasnia's main interest is

285

In peaceful exploitation of space.

286
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,399
I'm not sure I believe you, Mr. Savage.

287
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,868
I'm not sure I care.

288

What do you say, I'm the original Vandal Savage?

289
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:02,157
I'm over 100 years old?

Whoever you are,

I'm not going to let you hurt Audrey.

Hurt her? I love her.

I've never met a woman who can do the things for me that she can.

294
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,001
I don't want to hear this.

295
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,201
I was talking about her

Making me a member of the royal family.

Ah, colonel Vox.

Wonder Woman was just leaving.

00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:21,560
Would you be so kind as to escort her out.

300
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:22,727
I can find my own way.

301

All non-essential personnel clear the canopy.

Is all you require this evening, your highness?

311

Quite. When I need your services-- Uh!

Oh! Uh!

313
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,321
Vandal Savage sends his regards...

314
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,723
And a message:

Very pleasant, indeed, Jim.

You can't be serious.

Or I'll blow a hole in the hull.

00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,476
The pieces begin to fit.

342
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:25,977
I don't know.

343
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:28,696
I had J'onn look up his birth certificate and school records.

344
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:30,915
It looks like it all checks out.

345
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,301
Papers can be forged.

346
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,887
Well, whether he's our Savage or a sequel,

347
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,322
He makes me nervous.

348
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,291
He should. Look at what we've got so far.

349
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:41,042
A Kasnian operative stealing military secrets,

350
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:44,279
Kasnia spearheading the International Space Station.

351
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:48,266
Good cover to circumvent the weapons embargo they're supposed to be under.

352
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:51,353
If that's all Savage is up to, we're lucky.

353
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:54,789
Hold on a minute.

354
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,158
Siroya Basheer at the royal palace in Kasnia.

355
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,978
Sources confirm reports that King Gustav has suffered a serious stroke.

356
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,747
Serious and convenient.

357
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:03,748
You get all that, Diana?

358
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,201
I'm on my way to warn Audrey.

359
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,536
Meet you there.

360
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,572
Audrey?

361
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:14,242
Audrey, it's Diana.

362
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:15,510
[jet engines roar]

363
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,228
My apologies for the intrusion.

364
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,229
But we're being followed.

365
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:36,547
Rest, my darling.

366
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:38,900
I'll attend to this.

367
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:42,821
It's Wonder Woman.

368
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,208
Why don't you have a word with her?

369
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,550
Uh!

370
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,207
Ah!

371
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,393
I'm sorry, milady.

372
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:56,411
We've done all we can.

373
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:57,878
Audrey...

374
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,132
No.

375
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:03,902
If my father cannot rule, my duty is clear.

376
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,339
For the good of Kasnia,

377
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:11,459
I must assume the throne until my father is able again.

378
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:14,012
Of course, my counsel is at your service...

379
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:15,946
As it was for the king.

380
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:18,149
I don't require your counsel, vandal.

381
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:20,885
I beg your pardon?

382
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:24,139
The people need reassurance in the royal family's continuity.

383
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:26,591
Our wedding will take place immediately.

384
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:28,943
Is that acceptable to you?

385
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:32,380
Nothing would make me happier.

386
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,702
