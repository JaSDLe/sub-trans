Begins in the Arizona desert at a secret facility

Where 5 innocent children were taken

After being snatched from their families by the government.

119
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:43,525
They promised to educate the kids,

But they wanted something in return,

122
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,933
Because, you see, each of these kids

123

The government said it was protecting them,

136

But what it really wanted was to make them into human weapons.

137

And they would have gotten away with it, too,

They've stuck to me like flypaper ever since.

But they don't call me king for nothing.

A real genius, that one.

154

155
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,078

Wouldn't you agree?

168
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:40,127
So, we just let them go?

169
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,762
Batman: For now.

170
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,498
Our first priority is finding the real bomb.

171
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,233
Just give me a second.

172
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:57,645
Superman: There we go. Found it.

173
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:00,080
No. Wait. There's another one.

174
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,081
2 more.

175
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,583
3.

176
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:06,953
25.

177
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,255
There are 25 bombs.

178
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,594
Surprise! This is where we change all the rules.

179
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,030
There are 25 of my little party favors

180
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:18,132
Hidden all over the strip,

181
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,834
And they're set to go off in...

182
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:23,904
Oh, dear. That's not a lot of time.

183
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,207
And the last one's on the main floor of the Sphinx hotel.

184
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,709
Split up and take them out.

185
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,811
Stay in communication. Let's move!

186
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,714
Joker: Oh, thrilling, isn't it?

187
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:35,816
The suspense is killing me.

188
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:39,152
Of course, it's going to be the explosions that kill them.

189
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,477
First one's a dummy. I'm moving on.

190
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:06,781
I was hoping someone would drown trying to disarm it.

191
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:08,816
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

192
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,629
The good news is it looks like the bat is getting warm.

193
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,002
Getting warm, I said.

194
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:33,841
He's next to a volcano!

195
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:37,545
[laughing]

196
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,683
That's enough. Nobody likes a brown-nose.

197
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:08,509
While there's a break in the action,

198
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:10,511
Let's see who the oddsmakers favor.

199
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,347
Smart money's all on your boy Jack, Mr. J.

200
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:15,348
Batman has the edge in experience...

201
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,384
And weight, I can't help noticing.

202
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:20,387
I suspect he's indulging in too many bat donuts.

203
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:21,821
But Jack is younger,

204
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,857
And he definitely has the longer reach.

205
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,001
Running out of time, bats.

206
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,370
I'll stop them.

207
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:40,074
Wasn't talking about the bombs, old man.

208
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,436
Tired, grandpa?

209
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,005
[Batman groans]

210
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:14,208
Much as I hate to miss any of Batman's whuppin',

211
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,510
Flash has found one of my party favors.

212
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:19,212
Let's see if he's as stupid as he looks.

213
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:25,920
This bites.

214
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,421
You'd think the off switch would have a label on it.

215
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,328
Joker: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

216
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:37,363
The bomb's got a motion detector.

217
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,399
If you try to move it, it'll blow.

218
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,069
You have to defuse it to take it out of play.

219
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,904
No cheating.

220
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:46,340
How do I know you're telling the truth?

221
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:50,244
Maybe I'm lying. Try me.

222
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,480
[beeping]

223
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,349
Batman, I've got a problem.

224
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,518
You... don't... say.

225
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,453
Uh!

226
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,389
Flash: I found a bomb.

227
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:02,757
You've got to talk me through disarming it.

228
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:04,948
Ok, remove the lid.

229
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,003
Already done.

230
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,670
Don't jump ahead! Do exactly as I say.

231
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,220
I opened it before I called.

232
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:11,198
Uh!

233
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,434
Batman, you ok?

234
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:15,936
Grasp the red metal collar with both hands.

235
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,871
Pull it straight up.

236
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,741
It's magnetized. Don't touch the sides,

237
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,642
or it'll blow up the whole block.

238
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,344
Done.

239
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:25,645
Disconnect the following wires in-- aah!

240
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:27,148
In precisely this order--

241
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:31,101
Blue, yellow-and-black striped, red, then black.

242
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,220
Ok. What next?

243
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:35,689
You're done. Find another one.

244
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,358
I'm on it.

245
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,227
Spoilsport.

246
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:45,199
What do you say we catch up to the big blue buffoon?

247
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,202
[fighting]

248
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,744
Out of my way. You don't know what you're doing.

249
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:59,212
Yeah, I do. I'm kicking Superman's butt.

250
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,248
[beeping]

251
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,519
While they duke it out,

252
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,522
Let's go over to Amos Fortune's casino and resort,

253
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,091
Where Green Lantern has found another bomb.

254
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,207
I can't believe he didn't suspect a trap.

255
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:29,410
See what happens when you don't watch enough television?

256
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,422
Done yet?

257
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:50,130
I haven't even started.

258
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:57,938
Hey, Joan of Arc, you want to take me on?

259
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,043
Shouldn't have done that.

260
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,224
Why not put a force field around it

261
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,793
And let it blow?

262
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,295
I don't know if I can contain

263
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:22,796
An explosion that size.

264
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,297
Maybe you should let me defuse it.

265
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:25,866
Maybe you should shut up!

266
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,168
Whew! Is it just me,

267
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:31,238
Or is there something going on between those two?

268
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:34,708
Will Green Lantern ever admit to his feelings?

269
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:37,745
Will Hawkgirl ever stop sublimating her passions

270
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:40,247
with that big honking mace?

271
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:43,217
Will true love conquer all?

272
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,619
Not on my show.

273
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,855
[beep]

274
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:48,989
Aah!

275
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,164
John!
