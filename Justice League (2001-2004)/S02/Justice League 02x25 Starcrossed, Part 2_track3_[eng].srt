Previously on "Justice League..."

2
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:12,132
5 years ago, we secretly sent an advanced agent to Earth

3
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:13,500
To learn more about your people

4
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:15,101
And to study your defenses.

5
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:17,003
You mean she's a spy?

6
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,106
She was spying on us.

7
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:20,741
The greatest evil in the universe,

8
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:22,076
The Gordanians--

9
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,910
They are coming here.

10
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,746
This will be the fate of Earth

11
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,431
Unless you accept our help.

12
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,466
Hro and I are promised to each other.

13
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:31,869
It's like being engaged.

14
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:33,437
This generator-- when we're finished,

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,254
It's gonna be the size of a city.

16
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:35,406
It has to be.

17
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,207
It's got to sustain a force field

18
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,527
Strong enough to protect Earth from the Gordanians.

19
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:41,111
Diana, I was right.

20
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:42,730
The Gordanians are nowhere near Earth.

21
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:43,914
The thanagarians are--

22
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,382
Ugh!

23
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:46,750
-Unh! -Aah!

24
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,286
Activate force field projection... Now!

25
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:52,539
Unh!

26
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,673
Ooh!

27
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:55,275
Unh! Unh!

28
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,461
Don't fight us. We're trying to help you.

29
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,663
Whose side are you really on?

30
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:00,497
Unh!

31
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:01,866
I'm sorry, John.

32
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:05,302
[grunt]

33
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,886
All ICBM commands are reporting zero fire capability.

34
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,687
All triton subs inoperative, sir.

35
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,760
General Welles, France is reporting total failure of its ballistic systems.

36
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,509
China's ICBM are all nonresponsive, sir.

37
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,078
Russia reports the same.

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,347
All long and intermediate-range missiles are inoperative.

39
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,349
Patch me through to NATO command.

40
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:32,039
Gentlemen, we are faced with an unprecedented situation.

41
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,974
There has been a simultaneous catastrophic failure

42
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,243
Of defense systems around the world.

43
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,945
In the face of the thanagarian threat,

44
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:39,647
We need to form an offensive strategy

45
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:41,064
If we have any chance of--

46
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,249
[static]

47
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,035
Get that line back up!

48
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,703
Can't, sir. It's being jammed.

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,208
This is commander Hro Talak.

50
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,711
In the name of the thanagarian authority,

51
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:55,195
We claim your planet as a garrison

52
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,297
And have instituted martial law.

53
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,201
Your world faces a crisis from which only we can protect you.

54
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,535
But to be effective,

55
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:05,805
We must be free to act and move without interference.

56
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,108
Cooperate, and our stay will be brief

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,709
And without incident.

58
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,311
Stand against us,

59
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,597
And our wrath will be unforgiving.

60
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,607
[murmuring]

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,382
Commander, we ask that you release us immediately.

62
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:33,984
Ask? We demand it.

63
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:36,153
You have no right to keep us here.

64
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:37,587
You are the ones without rights.

65
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,690
Your militaries are useless.

66
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,441
Your Justice League is defeated.

67
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:45,011
Your only options are cooperation or death.

68
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,647
Choose wisely.

69
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,865
Now... You are free to go.

70
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:58,442
You've lived among them.

71
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,027
Do you think they'll cooperate?

72
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:01,712
I think they got the message,

73
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:03,580
But what about the Justice League?

74
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,432
What are you going to do with them?

75
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,067
For special guests,

76
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,353
I have made very special arrangements.

77
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:24,951
Traitor!

78
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:28,088
[grunts]

79
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:39,383
Look at them--

80
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,717
Weak...

81
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:43,620
Useless...

82
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,922
[Flash groans]

83
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,257
Broken.

84
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,862
It would have been difficult to storm their Watchtower

85
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:55,765
Without the access codes you provided.

86
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,435
Also, your analysis of their weaknesses

87
00:04:58,437 --> 00:04:59,803
Was most helpful.

88
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,555
That one will be the least trouble of all.

89
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:04,891
He's nothing without his toy.

90
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,428
Don't underestimate them.

91
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,113
You're right.

92
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,982
Perhaps we should make sure they are not a threat.

93
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:16,152
Better still, perhaps you should.

94
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:23,059
The point of this occupation is to keep peace

95
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,994
While we finish our mission.

96
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,997
If we kill Earth's heroes, the natives will revolt.

97
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,551
Our best plan is to build the shield, then go.

98
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:34,171
Make sure they're well taken care of.

99
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,674
[beeping]

100
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:02,633
How am I supposed to feed myself

101
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:04,234
Tied up like this?

102
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,353
Not my problem.

103
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:09,072
It will be if Hawkgirl finds out you disobeyed her orders.

104
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:10,674
I know my duties.

105
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,127
Then I guess you'll have to feed me.

106
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,513
Don't be afraid, little man.

107
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:17,798
I won't bite.

108
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,350
Mind your tongue, woman.

109
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:21,935
I fear nothing.

110
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,357
Eat.

111
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:30,928
Aah!

112
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,413
Ohh!

113
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,799
Hyuh!

114
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:36,867
Aah!

115
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,172
Ptui!

Security breach in cell block 7.

117
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,666
Diana! The force field!

118
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,654
Free the others.

119
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,625
Unh!

120
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,617
Aah!

121
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:16,272
Hmm. I feel like I just ran a marathon on Jupiter.

122
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,974
You can rest later.

123
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:23,714
Hyah!

124
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,984
Ohh!

125
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,458
The lights.

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,525
Lean on me.

127
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:47,737
Unh!

128
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:05,839
Here. Try this.

129
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:12,212
Took you long enough.

130
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,797
Behind you!

131
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,219
We're losing altitude fast.

132
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:36,836
We need to go now!

133
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:05,332
Commander, there's been a security breach

134
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,367
Aboard the prison shuttle.

135
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,968
The Justice League has escaped.

136
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,503
How did it happen?

137
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,538
They're the Justice League, that's how it happened.

138
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,940
Take a strike squad back to the surface.

139
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,209
Search every house, every building,

140
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,527
Look under every rock.

141
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:18,745
Find them!

142
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,247
By your command.

143

Go!

00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:04,541
Onward.

00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:14,834
We've got to move, people.

146
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,711
Everyone inside.

147
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:26,012
Could you give me a hand with these?

148
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,900
Still not back to full strength.

149
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:34,437
Much better. Thanks.

150
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,726
Diana, cover our tracks.

151
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:51,070
That x-ray vision working yet?

152
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,290
Just enough to see hawksoldiers still patrolling the skies.

153
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,710
They'll have the whole city covered by now.

154
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:57,778
Who knows?

155
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,946
Maybe they'll get tired and go home.

156
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,982
Yeah, I know,

157
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,285
But a little optimism at a time like this couldn't hurt.

158
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:10,040
This is the voice of the thanagarian occupational authority.

159
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:11,525
Your so-called Justice League

160
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:14,260
Is in violation of our martial law.

161
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:16,379
They are to be considered an enemy

162
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,814
And dealt with on sight.

163
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:21,067
Any person found aiding or harboring them

164
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,719
Will be summarily punished.

165
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:25,272
Ok. So much for optimism.

166
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:27,807
For the time being, we're gonna have to go underground.

167
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,075
How exactly do we hide

168
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:31,344
When the entire planet is looking for us?

169
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:32,613
They're looking for the Justice League.

170
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:36,499
Without our costumes, we are merely ordinary citizens.

171
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,752
Hold on a second here.

172
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:40,821
What about the whole secret identity thing?

173
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:43,123
I mean, I trust you guys, but I'm not sure I'm ready to--

174
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,325
Wally west, Clark Kent...

175
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:47,044
Bruce Wayne.

176
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:50,597
Show-off.

177
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:53,884
Red hair. It suits you.

178
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:54,885
You think?

179
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,737
Change. Now.

180
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,186
-We need to split up.

181
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:15,555
They'll be looking for 6 of us, not pairs.

182
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:16,956
A rendezvous point?

183
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,142
We're about 30 miles from Gotham city.

184
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:20,977
We can regroup at my house there.

185
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:23,646
But try and keep a low profile.

186
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:26,983
30 miles through hawk-infested territory.

187
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:28,468
No problem.

188
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,858
The construction proceeds as scheduled.

189
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,194
We have added humans to the workforce.

190
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,511
Are they of any use?

191
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:41,681
They have no technical expertise to speak of,

192
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:44,551
But they can lift and carry as well as any animal.

193
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:47,054
We should complete the project by the target date.

194
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,940
Be aware that the Justice League has escaped.

195
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:51,291
Stand ready for an attack.

196
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,542
Let them come.

197
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:54,144
It would only be suicide.

198
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:55,462
Keep me informed of your progress.

199
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:58,365
And, Paran, let nothing delay you.

200
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,200
By your command.

201
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:02,252
Humans working as slaves?

202
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,671
Unfortunate but necessary.

203
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:06,674
We are on an unforgiving schedule,

204
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:09,826
And if we're going to finish the hyperspace bypass in time...

205
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,028
Bypass?

206
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,997
I thought we were building a force shield.

207
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,166
That was merely the cover story.

208
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,835
So when were you going to tell me your real plans?

209
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,303
Or didn't you think you could trust me?

210
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:25,392
Come.

211
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,901
For decades, the Gordanian homeworld

212
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:38,137
has been protected behind an impregnable defensive line,

213
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,006
But this chain of hyperspace bypasses

214
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:43,643
will allow our armadas to jump behind their defenses

215
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:46,145
and make a direct assault on the heart of their empire.

216
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,081
Earth is the last link in that chain.

217
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,449
Once the chain is completed,

218
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:52,018
We can attack and wipe out the Gordanian threat forever.

219
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,721
But if we open a hole in hyperspace,

220
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:56,356
it will destroy this entire planet.

221
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:58,024
Sadly, yes.

222
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:02,261
For Thanagar to live, Earth must die.

223
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,332
Lieutenant Kragger, we may have found something.

224
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,552
Maintain your position.

225
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,923
We found these,

226
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,825
And the lock on that door was broken.

227
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,247
They were here.

228
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:39,248
The Justice League has tried

229
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,017
To pass themselves off as civilians.

230
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,419
Search door to door. Question everyone.

231
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,722
Do not let them slip away.

232
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,395
We are here to serve the people of Earth.

233
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:54,197
We serve the people by making certain

234
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,766
That you do what is in your best interest.

235
00:14:56,768 --> 00:15:00,703
What is in your best interest is to do as we say.

236
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:04,040
Only by obeying us can we serve you.

237
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:13,149
Your identification.

238
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,950
Oh!

239
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,251
Hey, leave her alone!

240
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,853
Unh!

241
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:18,254
Diana, no.

242
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,123
You would stand here and do nothing?

243
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,724
We can't risk a confrontation here.

244
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:22,975
Hey, birdheads,

245
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:24,544
Go back to where you came from!

246
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:26,329
Get off our planet!

247
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,251
Oh!

248
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,154
Unh!

249
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:37,523
Over there! It's the Justice League!

250
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,627
So much for blending in.

251
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,171
In here.

252
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,424
Please. Hurry.

253
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:57,811
We can't stay here.

254
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:00,413
If they find you helping us...

255
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,249
Here. Sit here.

256
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,062
We're looking for a dark-haired man and woman.

257
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:19,015
If, perhaps, you could be more specific...

258
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:23,987
Has anyone entered here recently?

259
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:25,087
No.

260
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,705
What about those two?

261
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,475
Ah, the lovebirds.

262
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,042
Been here for hours.

263
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,028
Let's move on.

264
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,118
Sorry.

265
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,435
Don't be.

266
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:53,482
I can't believe bats is really Bruce Wayne.

267
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:55,351
You'd think a billionaire playboy

268
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:58,388
Could crack a smile every once in a while.

269
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,357
I can't believe how easily they've taken over.

270
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,524
Look, G.L.

271
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,576
Hawkgirl fooled us all.

272
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:06,929
You-- you can't blame yourself for what's happened.

273
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,314
I don't.

274
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,549
I blame her for what's happened to Earth.

275
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,152
I only blame myself for ever caring about her.

276
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:15,238
Be prepared to show identification

277
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,823
Or be detained.

278
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,442
I think we wanted the non-hawkpeople line.

279
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,227
If we run, they'll see us.

280
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,995
Well, staying here is no good, either.

281
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,165
If you've got any ideas, I'm open.

282
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,467
Uh-oh. Trouble.

283
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:29,601
Too many civilians.

284
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,671
If we try to help them, someone could get hurt.

285
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:32,722
Keep moving.

286
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,557
Have your identification ready.

287
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,592
What are we gonna do?

288
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,265
Excuse me!

289
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,116
Excuse me!

290
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:46,052
Clark Kent of "The Daily Planet."

291
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:48,438
We understand the thanagarians are doing construction

292
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,056
At a restricted location in the Gobi desert.

293
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:51,891
Can you confirm this?

294
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:55,177
Get that contraption away!

295
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,746
And just exactly how long

296
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,280
Do you plan on enforcing martial law?

297
00:17:58,282 --> 00:17:59,281
No more questions.

298
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:00,450
Go away immediately!

299
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,934
Can I quote you?

300
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,245
What are you looking at?

301
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:14,730
Nothing.

302
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:18,650
I have never seen anyone stare at nothing so intently.

303
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,753
I know this must be difficult for you.

304
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:23,005
Do you?

305
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:25,691
What is obligation can sometimes feel like betrayal,

306
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:28,477
But our only true obligation is to Thanagar.

307
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,113
There must be another way.

308
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:31,648
Can't you reroute the bypass

309
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,900
Through some uninhabited planet or moon?

310
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:37,186
-Any alteration would set us back more than 5 years,

311
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:40,456
And every moment we delay is equaled in the blood of our people.

312
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,992
That still doesn't give us the right!

313
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,794
There are billions of lives down there!

314
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,446
We are at war.

315
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,281
Have you forgotten why we fight?

316
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:50,867
Or what horrors the Gordanians are capable of?

317
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,119
Have you forgotten my long years rotting

318
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,471
In their stinking prison camps?

319
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:56,873
I haven't!

320
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,725
I have forgotten nothing,

321
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,111
But this war is no excuse to--

322
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,596
I am your commander!

323
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:05,481
You will not question me!

324
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,701
I don't even know you anymore.

325
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,520
Ahem.

326
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:13,873
What is it?

327
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,125
We've lost track of the Justice League.

328
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:17,994
They've blended with the populace.

329
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,012
It will be difficult to find them,

330
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,647
Unless, of course,

331
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:24,033
You know where they are.

332
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,287
You're a long way from home.

333
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,841
If you ever want to see it again, then I suggest you tread lightly.

334
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:33,442
[gasp]

335
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:34,843
Ohh.

336
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,219
She never really answered the question, did she?

337
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:56,882
[doorbell rings]

338
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:59,769
Uh, we're looking for Bruce Wayne.

339
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:00,619
We're friends.

340
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:03,573
Of course. Master Bruce is expecting you.

341
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:11,730
This way, please.

342
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,832
So, jeeves, do you come with the place,

343
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,536
Or does master Bruce rent you just for parties?

344
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:20,206
I've been in service here since the master was in diapers.

345
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,991
Now, there's a picture.

346
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,331
Your guests have arrived, sir.

347
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:32,701
You're late.

348
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:33,952
Nice to see you, too.

349
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:37,823
Hey! That's a giant dinosaur.

350
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:40,526
And I thought Batman was the detective.

351
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:43,229
We were just speculating

352
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:45,565
Why the thanagarians are really here.

353
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,316
Obviously not to protect us.

354
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:49,785
But if the Gordanians aren't actually anywhere near Earth,

355
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,821
Why do they need to build that force field?

356
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,622
If it is a force field.

357
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:54,657
Then what is it?

358
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,475
I can tell you.

359
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,783
You've got a lot of nerve, showing up here.

360
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:04,950
We should thank you.

361
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:06,786
It saves us having to hunt you down.

362
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:08,521
I didn't come to fight.

363
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:10,890
I came to help.

364
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:13,025
Hawkpeople all over the planet,

365
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:14,093
Martial law,

366
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,695
Us getting chased like dogs--

367
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:17,830
I don't think we can take much more of your help.

368
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:20,350
The situation is worse than you think.

369
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:23,336
They are building a hyperspace bypass.

370
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:25,838
When it's activated, it'll destroy the planet

371
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,073
And everything on it.

372
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:31,227
Here. This has all the information on the project.

373
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,378
Believe me.

374
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,981
I didn't know the magnitude of Talak's plans.

375
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,550
We'll check it out.

376
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:38,617
There's the door.

377
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,545
Aren't you going to turn your back on me, too?

378
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:53,749
Last time I let my guard down, you sucker-punched me.

379
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:55,434
It wasn't personal.

380
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:57,019
Keep telling yourself that.

381
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,088
I did what I thought was right then,

382
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,757
And that's what I'm doing now.

383
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,976
We're triangulating her position

384
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:23,062
From the tracking device you planted on her.

385
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:24,980
I have a fix on the location.

386
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,219
Ready the strike squad.

387
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:33,539
This time, they will not escape.
