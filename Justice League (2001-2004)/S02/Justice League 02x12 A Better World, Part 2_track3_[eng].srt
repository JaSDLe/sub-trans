Narrator: Previously on Justice League...

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,909
We're looking at another dimension.

3
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:12,211
It's just like ours.

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,046
Batman: Almost. But their Flash is still alive.

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,748
So is their Luthor.

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,050
Green Lantern: Their world is the mess ours used to be.

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:20,552
Hawkgirl: Too bad we can't help them.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,588
Batman: Who says we can't?

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,859
J'onn J’onzz: And the dimensions appear to be collapsing on each other.

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,461
Flash: So it's agreed, then.

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,229
Let's do it. I'm in.

12
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,133
[all screaming]

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,700
Uhh!

14
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,008
J'onn J’onzz: Look at that thing.

15
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:45,877
When we stop it, they'll be so grateful,

16
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,746
They'll roll right over for us.

17
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,949
Uhh!

18
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,084

Reporter: And what's with the new costumes, guys?

20
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,762
We just felt it was time for a change.

[beeping]

23
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,983
One question:

24
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,285
Why?

25
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,919
Because you and your friends

26
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,955
Couldn't do what needed to be done.

27
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,994
There are mercury switches at your hands and feet.

28
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,595
Any motion, and I'll know about it.

29
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:44,963
You've thought of everything.

30
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,498
No.

31
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,567
Just everything you'll ever think of.

32
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:55,874
[grunting]

33
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,876
Huh?

34
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,782
What are you looking at, huh?

35
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,184
Calm down.

36
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,151
You'll appreciate this someday.

37
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,922
Yeah? I don't think Hawkgirl is going to appreciate it too much.

38
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,824
That was an accident.

39
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,559
She's in our best hospital now, and--

40
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,861
I don't want to hear it.

41
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,932
Believe me, the last thing we want is to lose another...

42
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,232
Another what?

43
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,543
Batman: I think he likes you.

44
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,545
Must be my magnetic personality.

45
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,983
More likely, it has to do with what happened to this world's Flash.

46
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,250
You mean he's--

47
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,320
All this had to have been set off by something.

48
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,289
But to go this far,

49
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,557
Even over me...

50
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,793
It isn't that far from what we do...

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,461
If you think about it.

52
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:50,963
I'd rather not.

53
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,064
You figured a way out of here?

54
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,566
No.

55
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,834
Don't you mean, not yet?

56
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,070
No. I mean, not going to.

57
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,807
[grunting]

58
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,536
I can't believe they left it so unprotected.

59
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,705
We did... For a long time.

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,975
And how often did it come back to bite us?

61
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,854
[beeping]

64
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,988
Uhh!

65
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,957
Uhh!

66
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,365
You'll appreciate this someday.

67
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,002
What are you doing?

68
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,605
Trying every possible combination.

69
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,840
9-1-9-3-9.

70

[beep]

00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,812
How'd you know?

72
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,315
They're the numbers I use. How'd you get out?

73
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,218
I sped up my heartbeat till it looked like it flatlined.

74
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,619
I didn't know you could do that.

75
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,788
Neither did I, but I had to come up with something

76
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,889
If you weren't going to.

77
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,323
I couldn't, not with him

78
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,926
Anticipating everything I could ever think of.

79
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,762
But who could anticipate you?

80
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,470
I don't know about the rest of you,

81
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,371
But I'm ready to kick some serious--

82
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,006
You're gonna have to wait on that.

83
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,975
They've got Hawkgirl in a hospital somewhere.

84
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,743
You need to find out which one she's in

85
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,879
And get there before they hear about this.

86
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,682
This is your city. You know the hospitals better than we do.

87
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,250
I've got a portal to find.

88
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,618
I'll go with you.

89
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,186
Sorry, I have to do this alone.

90
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,198
Flash: Hospitals, hospitals.

91
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,836
Superman: They'd never keep her in that one.

92
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,170
There's no security.

93
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:49,274
And this one doesn't have the right equipment.

94
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,110
Wait a minute. In this world, we are the bad guys.

95
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,411
So?

96
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,781
Where would you send a sick bad guy around here?

97
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,525
Wait here. You're dead, remember?

98
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,228
Hey, the costumes will tip them off, anyway.

99
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,497
We'll just say it's a fashion choice.

100
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,712
[sniff sniff]

101
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,420
We need to see one of the inmates.

102
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:38,189
Why, certainly, Superman.

103
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,193
Right this way.

104
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:09,087
Oh, one little thing.

00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,827
Applesauce.

108
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,063
Right.

109
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,099
But Wonder Woman was supposed to say it.

110

[alarm ringing]

112
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,910
You must be stopped.

A robot.

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,815
I built mine to take over for me when I had to be away.

115
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,551
Green Lantern: Looks like the other guy had the same idea...

116
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:40,785
In spades.

117
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,202
Uhh!

118
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,343
Aah!

119
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,812
I knew you'd come here.

120
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,448
Just like I know you're going to... Do that.

121
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,054
What are you hiding for?

122
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,124
I do my best work in the dark.

123
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,759
I used to think that, too.

124
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,395
But what have you ever accomplished from there,

125
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,596
Aside from scaring a few punks half to death

126
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,465
And putting a few more in jail?

127
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,900
It all adds up.

128
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,701
Not fast enough.

129
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,170
If you really want to make a difference--

130
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,039
If you want to change the system instead of just patching it,

131
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,341
You can't be subtle.

132
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,775
You've got to step into the sunlight,

133
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,177
Take over, like we did.

134
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,085
[grunting]

135
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,756
Violent behavior will not be tolerated.

136

Nor will a bad attitude.

138

Sorry, I couldn't resist.

139
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,048
It's all right.

140
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,684
It... is?

141
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,353
With me, anyway.

142
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,589
This kind of thing just doesn't bother me anymore.

143
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:27,625
In fact, nothing really bothers me anymore.

144
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,827
But you might want to watch out for Superman.

[woman humming]

150
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,943
Think about it.

151
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,477
A world where there's no crime,

152
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,812
No victims, no pain.

153
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,781
And no choice.

The problem with democracy is,

00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:05,830
It doesn't keep you very safe. It has other virtues.

But you seem to have forgotten.

159
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,069
I didn't forget. I just chose peace and security instead.

160
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,004
You grabbed power!

161
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,539
And with that power,

162
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:16,574
We've made a world where no 8-year-old boy

163
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,809
Will ever lose his parents

164
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:20,578
Because of some punk with a gun.

Then shouldn't we stop them?

I'm going in for her.

00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,902
Ha! Ha! Ha!

172
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,904
Thanks.

173
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,244
I can't believe this is Gotham.

174
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,379
Where's the litter?

175
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,781
If you want people to respect the big laws,

176
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,617
You've got to enforce the small ones.

177
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:38,389
What are you doing?

178
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,558
The small laws, remember?

179
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm not paying for this.

180
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:44,395
Bad food, lousy service,

181
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,096
And then you add up the check wrong.

182
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,465
Sir, you're disturbing the other customers.

183
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,602
Look? 5 and 5 make 15?

184
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,739
Would you come with us, please?

185
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,308
Get your hands off m--

186
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,942
Wh--? I didn't mean it.

187
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,943
I-I'm sorry.

188
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,412
I'll pay it, whatever it is.

189
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,981
And the food-- it was good, really.

190
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:12,122
They'd love it here, don't you think?

191
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,257
Who?

192
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,758
Mom and dad.

193
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:17,194
They'd be so proud of you.

194
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:20,431
Just drive.

195
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,506
Don't make any sudden moves,

196
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,241
Or we'll vaporize the entire lot of you.

197
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:12,883
Hold it.

198
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,819
These are my prisoners, and I'm taking them back.

199
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,355
You're in the right costume, but how do I know

200
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:20,991
You're not one of them?

201
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,395
Are you questioning my authority, lieutenant?

202
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,501
Put your guns down. Now.

203
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,635
[guns clicking]

204
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,544
We'll go out the back.

205
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,149
You fooled 'em.

206
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,884
Even I thought you were him.

207
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,953
I am him.

208
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:58,629
So without your Flash, the Justice Lords went rogue?

209
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,297
It wasn't quite that simple.

210
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,365
Hey, he was the conscience of your group,

211
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,201
And that means I must be--

212
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:06,103
Green Lantern: Come on, Jiminy.

[thunder]

214
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,560
Batman: They're as strong as we are

215
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,962
And just as smart.

216
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,330
But they're willing to kill.

217
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:34,564
What are you saying?

218
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,634
That we have to be willing to kill, too?

219
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,035
I won't cross that line.

220
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,937
How else can we stop them?

221
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,005
You're the smart one.

222
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:42,172
You figure it out.

223
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,642
We can't do it,

224
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,777
Not unless we cross some kind of line.

225
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:53,918
[beeping]

226
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,692
It's Luthor.

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,194
Escaped again? Yes.

228
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:05,195
And he's taken a hostage, and--

229
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,131
Don't do it.

230
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,232
Why not?

231
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,101
It worked pretty well back home.

232
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,336
But here, they're not ready for it.

233
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,171
We'll see about that.

234
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,043
Maybe we should all go.

235
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,747
All right, I'm patient.

236
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,185
[explosion]

237
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,566
Where's the hostage?

238
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,735
There never was one.

239
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,241
Sorry.

240
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,608
Aargh!

Uh!

00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:25,803
Uh-oh.

Right here, big guy.

Wow, Supes,

256
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,730
You really know how to bring down the house.

257
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,739
Can't do it. Can you?

258
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,475
I'm the last piece of your conscience.

259
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,744
And this is the one thing you'll never do.

260
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,680
I've done a lot of things

261
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,915
I thought I'd never do these last two years.

262
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,284
One more won't hurt.

263
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,021
Hold it!

264
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,025
Nice company you're keeping.

265
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,493
Must be your true colors.

266
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,530
It's just one of the hard choices I've had to make today

267
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:00,931
Go for it.

268
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,132
Oh, yes.

269
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,209
Aagh! Aagh!

Aah!

275
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,813
It's a power disrupter,

276
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,883
And yours are now gone.

277
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,485

This would be so sweet.

280
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,578
But a deal's a deal.

281
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:26,283
What deal?

282
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,885
A full pardon, in exchange for his help.

283
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,287
Everything he does from now on

284
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,289
Is your fault!

285
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,356
It's a high price,

286
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,525
But it's better than the alternative.

287
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,269
I knew you wouldn't be able to change his mind.

288
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,037
Yeah? How?

289
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,874
Because I've felt the same temptations he has.

290
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,408
They're pretty strong.

291
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,577
So you're not such a boy scout after all?

292
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,681
Never even made it to my first merit badge.

293
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,872
But I can't take full credit.

294
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:24,608
I never would have been able to reconstruct the disrupter

295
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,011
Without Superman's high-speed assistance.

296
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,312
Where is it now?

297
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,414
I believe Superman has it.

298
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,882
That was part of our arrangement.

299
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,050
Where do you go from here?

300
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,418
Back to running LexCorp?

301
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,019
Oh, the business world doesn't seem

302
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:37,921
As challenging as it used to,

303
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,857
And there's no poetry in it, either.

304
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,426
I have been giving some thought to...

305
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,628
Politics.
