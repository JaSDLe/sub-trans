Oh, yeah.

00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:22,096
Way to big to be anyone else.

All units in position, sir.

00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:25,249
Get his attention.

Got him, sir.

I've heard it before.

11
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:41,432
Search the rubble. Show me a body.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,567
You heard him. Let's start digging.

13
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:44,686
Ohh! Hey!

14
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,505
Leave Grundy alone!

Grundy told stupid soldiers to stay away,

25

But soldiers still come.

Where are we?

42
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:52,039
You promised to give Grundy gold.

43
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,742
And I will once you've done your part.

44
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:56,227
If stupid Fishman

45
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,561
Tries to trick Grundy,

46
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,630
Grundy will crush.

Charming.

Your gold's inside.

Woman: Welcome back, your highness.

50
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,877
I assume this is Solomon Grundy.

51
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,679
My name is Inza.

52
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:17,081
Do you have Grundy’s gold?

53
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:20,734
Here, brute.

54
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,020
Everything I promised and more.

55
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,688
Ooh! Ha ha ha!

56
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:27,257
Grundy likes gold.

00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:29,009
Where's your husband?

58
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:31,078
Preparing for the incantation.

59
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,179
I'll tell him you're here.

Kent, your guests have arrived.

Please make yourself comfortable.

Take as many as you want.

My apologies for the delay.

69
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:11,751
I have a kingdom do protect.

70
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,154
Keep me waiting again at your peril.

71
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,390
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Grundy.

72
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,008
I am Dr. Fate.

Girl gave Grundy the cookies.

74
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,965
I've done as you asked.

75
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,349
Let's get on with it.

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,435
Soon, but first I have to make sure

77
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:29,219
He is truly what they say.

78
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,005
Too much talking! Grundy bored!

79
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:35,609
What does stupid magician want Grundy to do for his gold?

80
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:37,511
I need to know your origins.

81
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,012
How did you come to be

82
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,499
As you are?

83
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,484
Grundy doesn't remember.

84
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,453
Grundy's always been Grundy!

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,476
Doubtful.

86
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,489
Perhaps a simple spell of revelation.

87
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,411
Fate: Yes. I see now.

88
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,864
Your name was Cyrus Gold...

89
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:10,611
An evil man who performed many evil deeds...

90
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,312
[click]

91
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,582
Until the day you aroused an evil as great as your own.

92
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,241
They ended your life,

93
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:59,994
Cursed you with a powerful grigri...

94
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,098
And dumped your remains in a swamp

95
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,218
Redolent with mystical properties of its own.

96
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,992
These magics did not sit well together.

97
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,281
And so it was that decades later...

98
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:27,171
The swamp gave birth to a walking dead man,

99
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,540
Soulless and empty,

100
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:33,961
Always seeking, never knowing why.

101
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,730
Grundy remembers.

102
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,665
He meets our needs.

103
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,634
Then we should begin immediately.

104
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:43,404
The future of Atlantis is my only concern.

105
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:45,973
No. Grundy wants something.

106
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,341
We're already agreed.

107
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:49,944
You help us, I give you the gold.

108
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,146
Grundy not want gold!

109
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:56,634
Grundy wants what men took from him.

110
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,836
Their curse removed your soul.

111
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:01,472
Grundy wants it back.

112
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,941
Will magician help?

113
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,592
I will do everything I can.

114
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,094
If you help Grundy,

115
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,063
Grundy will help you.

116
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,732
Bring the trident.

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,785
We still have preparations to complete.

118
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,457
Clear.

121
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,009
Looked like you needed a hand.

122
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,343
I've had more than enough help

123
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,179
From your kind for one day, thanks.

124
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:43,314
Meaning?

125
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,432
My men had Grundy well in hand

126
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,117
Until your friend showed up.

127
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,319
What friend?

128
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:49,669
No one in the Justice League would--

129
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,771
Don't tell me what happened!

130
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,906
I was here.

131
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,673
He wrecked our tanks, grabbed Grundy,

132
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,909
And hightailed it

133
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,695
On the back of the flipping Loch Ness monster.

134
00:08:57,762 --> 00:09:00,581
Who? Aquaman.

135
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:06,320
Wonder Woman: We can't assume he's gone bad.

136
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:07,938
Aquaman helped save the world, remember?

137
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,090
He helped save Atlantis.

138
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,742
He couldn't care less about the world.

139
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,311
It doesn't make sense to jump to either conclusion.

140
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,413
Let's just see what he has to say.

141
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:19,216
You ever get chafed straddling the fence all the time?

142
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:21,018
Hold on a minute.

143
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,603
Something up ahead.

144
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,024
[people screaming]

145
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:41,355
Care to weigh in on the Aquaman question now?

146
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,090
I'll get back to you on that.

147
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,851
Aah! Aah!

148
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,970
Aah!

00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:02,926
Ow.

00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,401
Hah! Hah! Huh!

151
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:13,638
Haah! Aah!

152
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,062
Hera, give me strength.

153
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,431
Do you have to say that all the time?

154
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,432
[grunting]

155
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:30,871
Hawkgirl, catch!

00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,410
[growling]

157
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,392
Where's the creature?

158
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:57,665
Superman: Diving away from us.

159
00:10:57,732 --> 00:11:00,367
Running back to daddy.

160
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,636
Could be.

161
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,450
My friends, welcome back to Atlantis.

162
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,703
Thank you, your highness.

163
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,538
We've come here to speak with your husband.

164
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,507
"speak with" being a polite euphemism

165
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:25,042
For shutting him down.

166
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,359
What are you talking about?

167
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,062
Two attacks on the surface world

168
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,697
By giant sea creatures.

169
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:31,331
And we couldn't help noticing as we came in

170
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,033
That your army is on high alert.

171
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,869
So, looking to expand the kingdom?

172
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,621
After all you've been through together,

173
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,690
How could you even think such a thing of Arthur?

174
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:42,359
There doesn't seem to be any other explanation.

175
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:44,027
Come on. Where's Aquaman?

176
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,262
He's with Dr. Fate.

177
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,713
If he wishes to see you,

178
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,382
He'll summon you after his return.

179
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,482
That's not good enough.

180
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,751
This audience is concluded.

181
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:01,829
That went well.

182
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,598
What, you expected her to confess to an act of war?

183
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,632
She's royalty.

184
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,701
You were needlessly disrespectful.

185
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,670
Standard interrogation technique.

186
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,171
I was bad cop.

187
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,690
You're always bad cop.

188
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:14,191
Why play against type?

189
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:15,959
Anyway, we got a name out of her.

190
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:17,411
That's another thing that bothers me--

191
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,363
Aquaman and Dr. Fate?

192
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,315
Fate's some sort of mystic, isn't he?

193
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:22,382
That's right,

194
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,702
And only magic could have hurt me like this.

195
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,653
I guess I'm off the fence.

196
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,379
No door?

197
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,132
Fate!

198
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:42,403
Nobody home.

199
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,654
I want to see for myself.

200
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,923
Aah!

201
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,175
Magic.

202
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:50,561
Let me give it a shot.

203
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,397
Haaah!

204
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,486
After you.

205
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,743
Nice use of space.

206
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,214
Fate: I warn you both again--

207
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,901
Once the spell has begun, I cannot stop.

208
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:15,369
And the pain will be unbearable.

209
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:17,404
You've told us before. Get on with it.

210
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:19,172
Stupid magician.

211
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,375
Grundy not care about pain.

212
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,377
Grundy wants his reward.

213
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,762
Very well.

214
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:27,564
The elements are gathered in a place of power--

215
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:30,968
A wizard of great knowledge...

216
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:35,022
The trident of Poseidon...

217
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,273
Aah!

218
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,143
Fate: And the forbearance of a dead man.

219
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:41,678
[chanting]

220
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:47,134
The walls between the worlds have been torn asunder.

221
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,820
[chants]

222
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:52,890
I order them now sealed.

223
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,627
Power of the Titans which resides in their trident,

224
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:59,346
By the power of the Lords of Order

225
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:01,015
Which resides in everything,

226
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,083
By the power of Fate

227
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,186
Which resides in the helmet of Nabu...

228
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,489
[Fate chanting]

229
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:13,960
Banish the old ones and seal the breach.

230
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,662
[chants]

231
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,249
So Fate demands!

232
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,151
So Fate demands!

233
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,452
So Fate demands!

234
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,390
So Fate demands!

235
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:32,979
Fate: So Fate demands!

236
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:35,731
So Fate demands!

237
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,485
So Fate demands!

238
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,221
Stop!

239
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,059
Aah!

240
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,871
Haah!

241
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:00,973
Aah! Uh!

242
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:12,736
Aah!

243
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:17,590
Do you realize what you've done?

244
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,275
Leave here! Now!

245
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:22,578
Not without Grundy and a good explanation.

246
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,930
Fate: You've ruined everything!

247
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:25,581
Aquaman, stop them.

248
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,099
I'll try to improvise something,

249
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,285
But I must be allowed to concentrate!

250
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:33,189
Go away! Superman always takes everything from Grundy,

251
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,874
But not this time.

252
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:37,527
This time, Grundy crush!

253
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:44,601
I've got Aquaman. You take the magician.

254
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,469
Your mace seems to be giving him fits.

255
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,688
Just for the record, I didn't start this fight.

256
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,023
First time for everything.

257
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,293
Hawkgirl: Hrrah!

258
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,363
Too much noise. Away!

259
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,774
Really not your day, is it?

260
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,469
What were they trying to do to you?

261
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:22,572
Superman always attacks Grundy.

262
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,808
I was trying to help you.

263
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,075
Help yourself!

264
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,805
I'm not here to hurt you, Grundy.

265
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:56,839
Give up.

266
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,942
No.

267
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:00,727
Grundy can't give up.

268
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,980
Magician promised to help Grundy.

269
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,420
Don't make me do this.

270
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,040
Raah!

271
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,175
Uh!

272
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,260
[grunts]

273
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:21,797
Grundy will help magician,

274
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:25,451
Then magician will help Grundy.

275
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:29,973
Last chance. Let me go.

276
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,158
Grundy won't quit.

277
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:51,060
I'll try to make this as quick and painless as possible.

278
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:52,027
Huh! Haah!

279
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,514
Don't overestimate your abilities.

280
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:56,682
My people are warriors,

281
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,551
No less than yours.

282
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,604
As you wish. No quarter given.

283
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:14,193
Where are my friends?

284
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,747
Bring them back,

285
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:18,815
Or I'm going to find out

286
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,950
What that bell on your head sounds like.

287
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:23,753
Fate: You shouldn't make threats...

288
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,388
When you're so clearly outnumbered.

289
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,005
Running out of tricks?

290
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:44,557
Not entirely.

291
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,995
Hawkgirl: Aah!

[screeching]

294
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:14,420
Those runes. They're thanagarian.

295
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,812
What do you know about Thanagar? Talk!

296

Uh... Uhh.

298
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,124
Give them to me, Superman.

299
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:53,475
Let's slow this down.

300
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,077
It's way past time you explained

301
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:56,178
What's going on here.

302
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:59,565
I'll explain it to your grieving friends.

Haaaah...

00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,689
That's enough!

306
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,397
You've run out of choices.

307
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,150
Tell us what you're doing now!
