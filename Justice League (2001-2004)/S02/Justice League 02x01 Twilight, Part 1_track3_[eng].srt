1
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:29,308
Aargh!

2
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:32,745
[people yelling on radio]

3
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:35,782
Re-route plasma flux to starboard defense screens!

4
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,117
Helmsman, get us out of the gravity well now.

5
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:41,554
Not enough thrust, general. We just lost reactors 5 and 6.

6
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:43,639
Then boom us out of here, Blastio.

7
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:45,991
Too late, they've locked us in a simbio-beam.

8
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:03,392
Great Darkseid, the fleet ambushed us as soon as we hit the troposphere.

9
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,829
Starkiller 2 is gone, and we are in full retreat.

10
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:08,847
They were waiting for us.

11
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,317
You knew going into that sector

12
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:13,786
Was a violation of our treaty with New Genesis.

13
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:16,338
It was a calculated risk.

14
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:18,524
You have served me well, general.

15
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,826
Take as many of them with you as you can.

16
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,246
As you command, my lord.

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,767
We've lost contact.

18
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,635
General Steppenwolf, come in.

19
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:31,137
Steppenwolf!

20
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:38,027
I'm afraid the general isn't returning any calls today.

21
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:39,662
Orion.

22
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:43,799
Your invasion force is shattered. It's over.

23
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:47,520
Please accept this parting gift with Highfather's compliments.

24
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:17,699
Aah!

25
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,266
[grunting]

26
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,435
We know of your mad ambitions, Darkseid.

27
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,870
This is your final warning.

28
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:58,457
Break the treaty again, and you will be destroyed.

29
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,562
J'onn: Magnificent, aren't they?

30
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,052
Yes, yes, they are.

31
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,339
You miss your home world very much?

32
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,627
It doesn't take a telepath

33
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,429
To see what's troubling you.

34
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,381
I suppose not.

35
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:51,754
Forgive me, I didn't mean to pry.

36
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:55,357
J'onn, wait. It's all right, it's just...

37
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,959
Well, it's a long story.

38
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,645
Earth doesn't seem to be in peril at the moment.

39
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:10,205
[groaning]

40
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:12,441
Man: Faster, dogs,

41
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:15,494
To restore the glory of great Darkseid.

42
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,184
You underestimated Highfather,

43
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:23,619
And again, it cost you dearly.

44
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:26,438
The solution to the anti-life equation

45
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,040
Was almost within my grasp.

46
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,075
But at what price?

47
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,277
Our forces are decimated, our defenses weakened...

48
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,163
It was a fool's errand.

49
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:41,053
Er, what I mean to say is...

50
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,839
No one questions me, Desaad.

51
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:49,095
No one.

52
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:21,042
Father, father, did you see?

53
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,296
Be still, fool, I'm not blind.

54
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,632
But what is it?

55
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,555
It's death.

56
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,509
I tracked the criminals back to their fortress,

57
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:40,295
But like a rank amateur, I stumbled right into a trap.

58
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:42,531
By all rights, I should be dead.

59
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,334
Their particle beam ripped my molecules apart,

60
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:47,035
And shot them halfway across the cosmos.

61
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,572
And you have no idea where home is?

62
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,040
J'onn, Thanagar is so far away.

63
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:56,128
We've never even come into contact with the Green Lantern Corps.

64
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:58,848
What?

65
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:03,185
I was just thinking, you, me, Wonder Woman, Superman,

66
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:06,221
We are, all of us, orphans and exiles.

67
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,526
Maybe we should call ourselves the "just us" League.

68
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:12,544
[loud rumble]

69
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:13,779
What the devil...?

70
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,172
Batman: Sensors are picking up a powerful energy surge.

71
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,974
But I've never seen a signature like this.

72
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,793
I have. It's a boom tube.

73
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,962
[loud rumbling]

74
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:45,010
We meet again, Kal-El.

75
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,428
You!

76
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,367
Stop him before he knocks us out of orbit.

77
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:54,136
Superman, don't!

78
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,337
Let go!

79
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,656
I see you haven't forgotten me.

80
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,008
What do you want?

81
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:01,126
Though it pains me to admit it,

82
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:02,695
I need your help.

83
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:05,631
My latest skirmish with New Genesis has left

84
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,867
My military forces at considerably less than full strength.

85
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,470
Why should we help you?

86
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,857
Because my enemy is your enemy.

87
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:18,010
Even as we speak, Apokolips is being assimilated by

88
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,729
The kryptonian menace known as Brainiac.

89
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:23,682
You are lying. I destroyed him.

90
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,319
Apparently, he is harder to kill than you realized.

91
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,056
You know his pattern, Kal-El.

92
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,625
Once he's finished siphoning the memory banks

93
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:33,960
And technology of my planet...

94
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,796
He'll annihilate it.

95
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,797
Good.

96
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,298
Superman! What! You can't mean.

97
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:43,685
You may not care what happens to me or my world, but know this:

98
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:47,356
If Brainiac isn't stopped, countless millions more will perish.

99
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,492
Think about it.

100
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:01,721
Hawkgirl: So, what are you saying?

101
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:03,989
You'd sacrifice millions of lives

102
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,591
Just because you don't like this guy?

103
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,060
You don't know Darkseid like I do.

104
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:09,962
Batman: We know he used you...

105
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,116
Humiliated you... Brainwashed you...

106
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,085
Wound you up like a tin soldier,

107
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:17,253
And turned you loose against earth.

108
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:20,707
Cry me a river.

109
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:23,909
On the outside chance that this isn't another one of his schemes,

110
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,545
We have to take action.

111
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,213
So I suggest you get over it.

112
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,167
Brainiac has already destroyed countless civilizations,

113
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,369
And now he threatens another.

114
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,622
Do you want this to be the legacy of your people?

115
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,360
I'm telling you, there's something wrong with this whole scenario.

116
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,264
All right. We'll play Darkseid's game,

117
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:48,717
But I need you to do something for me.

118
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:08,154
Fire!

119
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:34,814
Aah!

120
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:47,593
Uh!

121
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:53,849
Don't let up.

122
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:00,706
My lord, Superman and the Justice League

123
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,107
Have agreed to come to our aid.

124
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,410
Transport them here, now.

125
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:12,802
There!

126
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,977
[dialing]

127
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,593
Looks like Darkseid was telling the truth.

128
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,496
Looks can be deceiving. Just stay sharp.

129
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,848
[groaning]

130
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,082
That was fun.

131
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,572
Let me get this straight.

132
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,541
Orion is Darkseid’s own son?

133
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,043
New Genesis and Apokolips

134
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,844
Have been at war for centuries.

135
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,512
Apparently, Darkseid and Highfather

136
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,084
Exchanged sons as part of some kind of peace treaty.

137
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,719
Sounds whacky to me, too.

138
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:21,320
But with a conflict on this scale,

139
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,056
We could use some backup.

140
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,757
So, where do we find this Orion?

141
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,776
[rumbling]

142
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,045
Aah!

143
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,087
[roaring]

144
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,848
Ah!

145
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,183
Batman!

146
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,105
[grunting]

147
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,349
Are you all right?

148
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,585
Peachy.

149
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,571
[coughing]

150
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:28,904
Uh.

151
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,305
This way. That buzz bomb won't hold him for long.

152
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,135
You should be safe here.

153
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,055
Uh.

154
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:10,445
Who are you?

155
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:11,696
They call me forager.

156
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,032
Do you know someone named Orion?

157
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,285
Orion? I am just an unworthy bug.

158
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:20,054
Orion is a god who is far above us.

159
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:22,874
You are too modest.

160
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,976
You've shown courage, compassion...

161
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,177
No, no, you don't understand.

162
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,230
All of the gods are far above us.

163
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,979
I'm going to need a longer grapple.

164
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,145
Darkseid: Idiot.

165
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,863
You're wasting your time.

166
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,249
I suppose you have a better idea.

167
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,251
You should know by now.

168
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,286
I always have a plan.

169
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,728
Such grandeur.

170
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,214
It even outshines Themyscira.

171
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:53,881
I've never seen the like.

172
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,050
We can take in the sights some other time.

173
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,519
Let's concentrate on finding Orion.

174
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:05,810
What have we here?

175
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,297
I've never seen bugs like you before.

176
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,632
We're not bugs.

177
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,467
Well, you're certainly not gods.

178
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:15,202
Hey, come back here.

179
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:18,023
Only if you catch me.

180
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,075
He's worse than the Flash.

181
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,625
Stay on him.

182
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:04,836
Hey!

183
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:09,040
Uh.

184
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:16,148
Hold still. We won't hurt you.

185
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:20,836
No, you most certainly will not.

186
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,123
Superman: Brainiac!

187
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:37,702
Kal-El, what brings you so far from your adopted home?

188
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:39,287
I'm here to end you.

189
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:42,123
If your father, Jor-El couldn't stop me,

190
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,525
What hope have you?

191
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:46,044
Drop that force field and find out.

192
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,948
No, I don't believe that will be necessary.

193
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,104
Ah!

194
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:18,593
Superman has played his part, now it's our turn.

195
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,650
Now!

196
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:56,915
Aah!

197
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:05,840
It appears you've won this round, Kal-El.

198
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:09,444
No!

199
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:28,596
Behind you!

200
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,784
Aah!

201
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,868
Oh.

202
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,052
You ok?

203
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,939
Uh, I've had softer landings.

204
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:56,241
Ow.

205
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,710
Darkseid: You imbeciles are letting Brainiac get away.

206
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,912
What are you waiting for? Finish him.

207
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,765
Sure, but only because you asked so nicely.

208
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:05,116
Here's our ride.

209
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,536
Still think Darkseid was up to something?

210
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:27,889
Hawkgirl, I'd bet the farm on it.

211
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,127
Gone! But that's impossible.

212
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:10,431
J'onn: Some kind of warp drive?

213
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:11,566
No, according to the navicomputer,

214
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,751
He should be right below us.

215
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:19,924
Oh, my stars. What is that thing?

216
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:23,678
Ah!

217
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,517
We'll know soon enough.
