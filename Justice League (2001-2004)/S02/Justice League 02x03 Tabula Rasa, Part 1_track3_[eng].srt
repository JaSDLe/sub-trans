1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,874
Hah!

2
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:19,613
Aah! Unh!

3
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,457
[grunting]

4
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:36,496
Aah!

5
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:38,032
Oof!

6
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:40,434
I don't need any help.

7
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,935
You're welcome.

8
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,570
Aah!

9
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,015
Unh!

10
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:01,688
Yaa!

11
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:03,223
Aah!

12
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:16,503
[screaming]

13
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,541
Come on!

14
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:24,211
He can wait.

15
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,522
Woman: Then fire them.

16
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,024
In fact, get rid of the whole division.

17
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,393
I don't care what Luthor would have done.

18
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,261
I'm in charge now,

19
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,562
And if you can't accept that, I'll...

20
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,039
Mercy.

21
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,479
[groaning]

22
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,548
Help me.

23
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,096
I'm... I'm...

24
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:24,564
Sick?

25
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,099
Dying?

26
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,434
And you couldn't do it somewhere else?

27
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:30,737
After all I've done for you.

28
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,439
You mean letting me, a lowly chauffeur,

29
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:35,608
Run your company while you were away?

30
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:37,911
Oh, was I flattered.

31
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,112
But then I realized

32
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,280
There was no one else

33
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:41,815
You could trust to give it back...

34
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,851
Only me, your loyal dog.

35
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:47,954
Well, let me tell you something.

36
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:50,290
This dog took LexCorp out of the hole you dug

37
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,759
And brought up the stock 38%

38
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:54,461
All on her own.

39
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,095
So if you think I'm ever gonna let you...

40
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,764
Unh!

41
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,766
[gasping]

42
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:01,701
Looks like there's some life

43
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,770
In the old suit after all.

44
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,672
Now where's professor Ivo?

45
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,340
[gasping]

46
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,043
I... I fired him.

47
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,378
You what?

48
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,279
He was one of our best scientists.

49
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,514
How could you do that?

50
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:15,749
Well?

51
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:18,317
I... I was trying to save money.

52
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:22,121
He's probably at his place in mountain view.

53
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,725
Unh!

54
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,459
Good girl.

55
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:28,795
[breathing heavily]

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,981
[screaming]

57
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,436
Superman: G.L.'s already patrolling the city,

58
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,038
And Hawkgirl will join him

59
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,206
As soon as we're done here.

60
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:15,241
Batman and I are going to follow up some leads,

61
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:17,343
But I just don't know if it'll be enough.

62
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,046
So... A psychic sweep.

63
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,047
Of the whole city.

64
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:22,348
Is it possible?

65
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,652
I've never tried anything like that before.

66
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:28,855
Once the gate is opened,

67
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:31,358
It might not be so easy to close.

68
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,026
I realize it's a lot to ask,

69
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,027
But Luthor...

70
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,094
I know.

71
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:38,064
He must be stopped.

72
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,333
Smart guy.

73
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,318
Ivo, it's Luthor.

74
00:05:58,386 --> 00:05:59,753
You've got to help me.

75
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:03,189
Will you get up? I'm d...

76
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,291
[gasp]

77
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,894
Looks like the cigarettes finally got you...

78
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,263
And maybe me, too.

79
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,034
[gasp]

80
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,943
Well, what are you waiting for?

81
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,879
It's not like I won't be dead soon enough, anyway.

82
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:16,963
Woman, thinking: I want him to love me...

83
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:19,432
But I don't think he even likes me.

84
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,169
Man: I wish she'd wear some vinyl.

85
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,240
Different woman: I smell bad. I just know it.

86
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:30,777
20 showers a day. I still can't get rid of it.

87
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:34,214
Man: Bald? How could anyone say I'm bald?

88
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,916
I just have a high forehead.

89
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,051
Different man: I should ask her out,

90
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,853
But what would she want with me?

91
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:41,187
But I should try, though.

92
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:42,255
Woman: Rotten kids.

93
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:43,557
They don't appreciate me.

94
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:46,225
Man: I just need a roof over my head.

95
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,794
That's all...

96
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,263
And a drink. Yeah.

97
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,564
Woman: It's funny.

98
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,633

Man: I'll sue the pants off him!

00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:19,125
Woman: I'll take him for everything he's got!

104
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:21,461
Man: She thinks she's so special.

105
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,496
Woman: What do I have to tell anyone?

106
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:24,631
Man: Looks like a gorilla.

00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,285
Aargh!

110
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,852
A little help here.

111
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,791
When will professor come back?

112
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,727
Never.

113
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:55,161
He has to.

114
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,001
You miss him.

115
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:02,869
So do I.

116
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,404
He was one of my best friends.

117
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:06,506
He was?

118
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:08,708
Almost like a brother,

119
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:10,343
And he would have wanted me to look after you

120
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,912
If anything ever happened to him.

121
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,283
So... You're going to take care of me now?

122
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,650
Mm-hmm.

123
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:20,720
But you're going to have to take care of me, too.

124
00:09:20,788 --> 00:09:23,023
<i>Otherwise, I'll go to sleep</i>

125
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,724
And never wake up again.

126
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,667
Thank you.

127
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,569
Now, there's one other thing I need...

128
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,771
Fuel.

129

[buzzer]

130
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:55,856
Stay back, freak.

131
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,426
Aah!

132
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,333
Aah!

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,667
Ohh!

134
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:26,980
Whoa! Whoa!

135
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,819
Hold it, big boy.

136
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,821
Yah!

137
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,758
Now, what did you want this for?

138
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:53,239
Hah!

139
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:12,024
Didn't figure on that one, did you?

140
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:13,392
Aah! Unh!

141
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,542
Mmm.

142
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,123
Aah!

[door closes]

145
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,738
Well, it looks like Ivo was right on the money.

146
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,442
His duplication program seems to be working rather well.

147
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,844
I assume you ran into Hawkgirl?

148
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:07,280
Girl with wings. Yes.

149
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,448
And seeing that you were able

150
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:10,483
To get away with this,

151
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:13,052
I take it she didn't fare too well.

152
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,087
Is she still alive?

153
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:16,222
Yes.

154
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,890
Aww.

155
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,125
What's wrong?

156
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:21,461
Let me tell you a story.

157
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:24,830
It's about a young man

158
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,734
Whose dream was to build a great empire.

159
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,135
He succeeded.

160
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,169
Then he lost it all

161
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:33,239
Because of 7 very bad people...

162
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:35,274
Hawkgirl and her friends...

163
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:38,744
The Justice League.

164
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:40,846
That young man was me, of course,

165
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:43,049
And now I have another dream.

166
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,351
It's to take back control of that empire.

167
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,754
And then, when the time comes,

168
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:51,224
I want to hand it down to someone who will continue my work...

169
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,925
The son I never had.

170
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:56,028
But none of that can happen

171
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,798
Until you give the Justice League what they deserve.

172
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:04,270
Mercy: He's the most deeply twisted man

173
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:05,271
I've ever met.

174
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,706
Of course I'll help you.

175
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,308
Good. If he contacts you,

176
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,509
Let us know.

177
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:11,644
You have my word.

178
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:14,280
He hasn't already contacted you, has he?

179
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:16,015
Don't you think I would have told you?

180
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:19,318
The two of you were very... Close.

181
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:20,987
I'm a different person now.

182
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:22,521
Right.

183
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,462
She was a little too cooperative, wasn't she?

184
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,897
You're learning.

185
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:33,333
I wouldn't mind hearing what she's really thinking.

186
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,334
[all talking at once]

187
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,116
Superman on radio: J'onn? Any luck yet?

188
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,117
No.

189
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:52,185
Where are you?

190
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,519
I can't talk now.

191
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:54,687
Are you all right?

192
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,589
Leave me alone!

193
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:57,656
Grr!

194
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,555
It was some kind of android.

195
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:30,623
It had wings built into it

196
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:32,024
And a mace, too.

197
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:33,158
Scary, huh?

198
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:35,294
Sounds like whoever made it had you in mind.

199
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,730
Yeah. It even acted like me.

200
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:39,766
Now, that's scary.

201
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:45,505
The android...

202
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,574
It's about 10 feet tall, gray skin?

203
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:49,942
How'd you know?

204
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,151
Unh!

205
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:02,922
Aah!

206
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,256
Unh!

207
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:08,327
Aah!

208
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:09,395
Ohh!

[sirens]

210
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,287
Aah!

211
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:38,591
You forgot to mention he's as strong as I am.

212
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,660
Hawkgirl: He wasn't like that before.

213
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,686
Aah! Aah!

214
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:07,687
Unh!

215
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:08,688
Ooh!

216
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:10,023
Unh! Unh!

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,893
Aah!

218

00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,373
Unh!

221
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,341
Hah!

222
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,644
Didn't figure on that one, did you?

223
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,455
Hah!

224
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,628
Unh!

225
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:00,973
Unh!

[grunting]

230
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:48,154
Another business call?

231
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,356
She fired Ivo months ago,

232
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:51,623
And he's an M.D.,

233
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:53,859
something Luthor should be needing right about now.

234
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:55,428
One more thing...

235
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:58,297
Ivo's specialty is nanotechnology.

236
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,167
Green Lantern: Batman, it's Lantern.

237
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,434
We've found Hawkgirl's robot.

238
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:03,436
Where are you?

239
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:05,137
Don't even think about it.

240
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,473
Somehow this thing's copying all our powers

241
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,008
Just by looking at us.

242
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:10,709
We can't just stay here.

243
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,711
That's exactly what you're gonna do.

244
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:13,845
You come here,

245
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:15,747
And all you'll do is make him even stronger.

246
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,283
Aah!

247

She'd better.

No one else can now.
