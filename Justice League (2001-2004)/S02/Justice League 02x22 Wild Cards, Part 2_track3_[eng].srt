00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,893
Narrator: Previously on "Justice League..."

2
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:10,496
I've tucked away a great big time bomb

3
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:11,964
Somewhere on the Vegas strip.

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,017
Only the Justice League can stop it.

5
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:18,537
And since every good suspense show has to have a ticking clock,

6
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:19,638
Here's mine.

7
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:21,774
Ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,559
Tonight's extra special guest stars,

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,210
Making their world debut,

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,047
The Royal Flush Gang.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,986
Batman: We've got trouble. The bomb is a fake.

12
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,804
25.

13
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,173
Superman: There are 25 bombs.

14
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,942
Joker: And they're set to go off in--

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,544
Oh, dear. That's not a lot of time.

16
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:43,696
[grunting]

17
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:51,286
Disconnect the following wires in precisely this order.

18
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:54,974
Blue, yellow-and-black stripe, red, then black.

19
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,758
Ok, what next?

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,310
Find another one.

21
00:00:58,377 --> 00:00:59,495
[beeping]

22
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:01,063
Aah!

23
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,784
John!

24
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:09,498
Uh!

25
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:13,903
Aah!

26
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:17,639
Lantern, are you ok over there?

27
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,625
Lantern, check in!

28
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,193
One of the bombs went off.

29
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,362
G.L. Was inside. I'm looking for him.

30
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,396
I'm on my way.

31
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:26,999
Batman: No, you're not. Stay with the bomb.

32
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:29,535
John!

33
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:34,223
John.

34
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,412
No.

35
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,649
Ooh, medical drama.

36
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,285
Life-and-death stakes.

37
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:48,954
Compelling human conflict.

38
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,906
Ratings.

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,067
Come on!

40
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:14,079
Aah!

41
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:18,283
I can't believe I almost lost you without ever telling you.

42
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,220
Telling me what?

43
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,755
Enough with the mushy stuff.

44
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:26,174
It's time for Superham's closeup.

45
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,843
Give it up, kid.

46
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,762
There's no way you can beat me.

47
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,381
I don't have to beat you.

48
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:35,034
I just have to slow you down until the bomb blows.

49
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,768
Hold that thought.

50
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,937
[screaming]

51
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,781
[screaming]

52
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,985
Now, where were we?

53
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,611
A person could really learn to hate that guy.

54
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:04,679
Let's go back to watching Green Lantern croak.

55
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,682
That should cheer me up.

56
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,883
I found John. He's in bad shape.

57
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,752
Uh!

58
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,088
We'll meet at the last bomb,

59
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:14,406
Then go after Joker.

60
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,175
Negative. John needs medical attention.

61
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,409
Make it fast. We gotta--

62
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:18,927
Hawkgirl out.

63
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:29,437
Joker: Oh, this'll never do. Harley.

64
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:31,239
Right here, Mr. J.

65
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,342
Come in for a nice, tight shot of Batman.

66
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,196
You heard the man. Nice and tight.

67
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:40,699
Joker: Lower. Lower!

68
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,426
Pull up! Pull up!

69
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:53,645
Aah!

70
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,666
Ooh. Heh heh!

71
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,835
Technical difficulties.

72
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:02,170
Let's move on, shall we?

73
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:03,772
Ah, yes.

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,242
By my count, the Justice League has disarmed or disabled

75
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,477
All but one of my bombs.

76
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:13,832
I still don't think they're going to make it, though.

77
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:30,482
Aah!

78
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,368
Come on, you didn't think it was going to be that easy.

79
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:36,271
Well, yeah, kind of.

80
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,760
Time to find out just how fast you are.

81
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,821
[groans]

82
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,011
That about wraps you up.

83
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,497
[muffled screams]

84
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:03,999
I know.

85
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:07,068
It's all I could think of on the spur of the moment.

86
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:08,704
Uh!

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,709
Here's the thing--

88
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,413
Superman just tossed me halfway across town.

89
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,265
I'm taking it out on you.

90
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,435
Much as I'd enjoy watching my boys pummel the Flash,

91
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,271
I've learned from hard experience

92
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:29,174
That it always pays to keep an eye on bat guano.

93
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:35,013
[groans]

94
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:36,781
Harley, where's Joker?

95
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,317
After all these years,

96
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:41,119
You still think I'd give up Mr. J.?

97
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,055
Why not? He gave you up.

98
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,657
That was a long time ago. He's changed.

99
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,777
We've been to couples counseling.

100
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:50,345
I'm talking about right now.

101
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:52,313
Or haven't you been watching the show?

102
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,182
You've seen the way he touches her hair,

103
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,952
The way he rubs her shoulders.

104
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,588
You mean Ace? She's just a kid.

105
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:02,074
Really? Then why is she with him

106
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:04,209
While you're out here in the cold?

107
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:09,181
Uh!

108
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:11,833
Have to admit, didn't see that one coming.

109
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,768
Ooh, look at the time.

110
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,854
We don't want to miss the big finish.

111
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,839
[grunting]

112
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,230
Put him down!

113
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:27,515
You want him? You got him.

114
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,193
Aah!

115
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,375
I'm stronger than anybody.

116
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,710
I knew I was stronger than you.

117
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,329
Aah!

118
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,431
I've heard it before.

119
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,999
Have you heard this?

120
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:10,375
You can't beat us both.

121
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:12,827
Are you crazy as Joker? We've got less than a minute.

122
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,047
If you beat me, you'll die in the explosion.

123
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,466
So? I'll win.

124
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,134
[beeping]

125
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:23,138
I'm outta here.

126
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,375
Imitates chicken]

127
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:31,847
Aah!

128
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,437
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

129
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,141
Superman: Flash!

130
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,576
I'll keep this maniac busy.

131
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:45,694
Defuse the bomb.

132
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,940
Uh!

133
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,810
Even you can't disarm one of my bombs in time.

134
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,128
Shut up!

135
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:05,413
What kind of a retort is that?

136
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,132
You're not even trying.

137
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,000
Not the blue one!

138
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,085
You'll blow us all to smithereens!

139
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:15,107
Seriously, you were right. Cut the black one.

140
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:16,992
I mean, the red one. No, blue!

141
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,209
That's it. Black and yellow striped one.

142
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:19,594
No, wait! Green.

143
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:24,983
[explosion]

144
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,268
What just happened?

145
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,436
He, uh, I think--

146
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:31,973
Get me an instant replay. Super-slow motion.

147
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,876
Huh.

148
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,132
Hey, Supes.

149
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:02,304
That's the last of the bombs. We win.

150
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:04,422
That was quite a stunt you just pulled off.

151
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,741
I know. Can't wait to catch the rerun.

152
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:09,211
Joker: Was that great or what?

153
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,531
Let's give a big hand to the Justice League for foiling my bomb plot.

154
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,182
Come on!

155
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:21,172
You know, our show was picked up by all the news channels.

156
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,610
And the last 15 minutes or so has been running on the broadcast networks.

157
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,445
According to my projections,

158
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:31,916
We've got somewhere between 60 and 70 million people watching right now.

159
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:33,951
And that was the point all along.

160
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,787
This whole thing was a stunt

161
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,622
To get as many of you watching as possible,

162
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,956
And it worked.

163
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,560
My Royal Flush Gang provided the conflict.

164
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,795
The Justice League brought the star power.

165
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:48,233
And I brought the shocking surprise ending.

166
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:51,069
Everyone watching the show right now

167
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,672
Is witness to my greatest joke ever.

168
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:55,907
In just over 5 minutes,

169
00:10:55,974 --> 00:11:00,478
You'll all be hopelessly, incurably insane.

170
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,018
Can't stop looking, can you?

171
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,521
I wish I could say it's my animal magnetism,

172
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:13,591
But it's really my little Ace in the hole.

173
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,543
Different, they called her.

174
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:18,195
Some even said she was a monster.

175
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,149
Is this a monster?

176
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:23,884
I ask you.

177
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:29,923
Purely rhetorically, of course.

178
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:33,461
Condemned for something she could barely comprehend,

179
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:37,915
Our little Ace soon found herself a guest of the government.

180
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,712
But even they were afraid of her strange power.

181
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,502
Fortunately for them,

182
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,241
Their nasty little headband made her as harmless as a drowned kitten.

183
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,928
My poor, poor Acey.

184
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:27,998
All your life, people have been recoiling in fear from you.

185
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,584
Oh, can I relate.

186
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,770
Maybe that's why I'm the only one

187
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:34,939
Who's never been scared of you.

188
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:38,809
You see, Ace can send out thought waves that alter perception.

189
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,444
But enough with the jargon.

190
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,481
She can make you crazy just by looking at you

191
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,586
In person or on TV.

192
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:50,754
Even as I speak,

193
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:53,557
Millions of you slack-jawed couch potatoes

194
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,459
Are losing your grip on reality,

195
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,562
Which in my opinion is highly overrated anyway.

196
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,130
But you can't look away,

197
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,767
Even though you know something is terribly wrong.

198
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,102
And the best part--

199
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,473
I'm immune to all this because I'm already crazy.

200
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:11,375
Joker: Turn it up, baby.

201
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,678
Superman: We need... To fight.

202
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,295
To fight.

203
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,998
Yeah, but I can't.

204
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:39,920
It's only a matter of time now.

205
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:45,626
A few more minutes, and millions of people are going to go...

206
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,561
And it's all because of you--

207
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,465
The best sidekick a homicidal maniac ever had.

208
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:53,533
Harley: What about me?

209
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,835
Harley!

210
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:57,971
Yeah, Harley, you worthless two-timing piece--

211
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,242
Wait! Wait.

212
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,410
We can't let everything we have be ruined

213
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,729
By a silly misunderstanding.

214
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:08,933
And just what is it that I'm not understanding?

215
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:11,368
That we're two of a kind,

216
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,839
That you'll always come back to me.

217
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:16,807
Yeah, I guess I do, don't I?

218
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,625
But--

219
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,094
Like the swallows in Capistrano.

220
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,930
And there's one other thing you're not getting.

221
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,648
What?

222
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:28,786
That you led Batman right to my doorstep!

223
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:30,271
Uh!

224
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,408
Tough love.

225
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,445
Very effective. Don't you think so, Batman?

226
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:39,046
Yoo-hoo!

227
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:40,514
Batman!

228
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:43,084
I know you're up there-- oh!

229
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,654
Oh, there you are.

230
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:51,859
Acey, why don't you give him a piece of your mind?

231
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,452
[croaking]

232
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,029
Turn up the juice.

233
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:22,189
Uhh...

234
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,710
[groaning]

235
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:36,837
Oh, how I've waited for this.

236
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:55,506
# big old bats has fallen down #

237
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:56,674
Uh!

238
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:57,892
# on the ground

239
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,328
# mind unsound

240
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:08,451
# big old bats has fallen down #

241
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,105
Uh!

242
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,573
I'm so happy!

243
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,915
Ah!

244
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,769
I've never seen you this determined, bats.

245
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:27,638
But as they say,

246
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:31,308
All good things must come to an end.

247
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,714
Hmm. Nice lamp.

248
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:53,046
Just-- just a souvenir, that's all.

249
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:54,782
Give me that!

250
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,540
I'm not afraid of you.

251
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,443
Wait. Please.

252
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:10,013
I know what it's like to frighten other people.

253
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:12,165
That's why I'm not afraid of you.

254
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,251
I'm the only one.

255
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:19,606
Don't do this.

256
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,559
[groans]

257
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:25,913
Do what?

258
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,948
That's my little Acey.

259
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:29,917
Everything's going to be...

260
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:31,568
Aah!

261
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,175
[screaming]

262
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,951
Where...

263
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,587
Are you gonna... go?

264
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,940
Nowhere.

265
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,351
[groans]

266
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:35,782
It was the shock of the detonation that stopped his heart.

267
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,167
No, he's going to be fine.

268
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:38,569
I'll stay with him tonight.

269
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,740
Batman, about before, I'm sorry. I--

270
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,609
Batman: No. We never leave a man behind.

271
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:47,210
Right?

272
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,945
Right.

273
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,582
Ok, I'll check in later.

274
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,085
[beeping]

275
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,475
[groan]

276
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:02,859
Hey.

277
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,862
Hey. Go back to sleep.

278
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,447
I'm not sleepy.

279
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:10,450
Besides, we've got things to talk about.

280
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:11,952
It can wait.

281
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,771
Not anymore. I'm tired of waiting.

282
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,740
You know how I feel about you.

283
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:18,025
John...

284
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,761
And I know you feel the same way.

285
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,883
It's not that simple.

286
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,486
John, this can't go any further.

287
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:31,338
Why not?

288
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:33,357
It's crazy.

289
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:34,658
We work together.

290
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:37,627
So? It gives us something in common.

291
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:39,763
We can't be worrying about each other

292
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,331
When we're fighting the bad guys.

293
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,699
Too late for that.

294
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,685
What else you got?

295
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:47,037
We're... so different.

296
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,939
I mean, look at us.

297
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:51,341
Just look at us.

298
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,586
I see a man and a woman.

299
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,398
Woman: Well, it's about time.

300
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:06,383
[bells ringing]
