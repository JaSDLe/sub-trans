Grab a lightspeed booster bar

With a big burst of flavor in every bite.

00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:15,245
This is what these self-appointed guardians of humanity

Are really about--

00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:18,331
Cashing in on their image,

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:20,400
Shilling for whoever's got the deepest pockets.

9
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:23,420
No one's asking the other guys to do this sort of thing.

10
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:25,472
That's because they don't have me as their agent.

11
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,642
We believe that our new A.F.D., Anti-Fusion Device,

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,363
Will enable us to completely neutralize enemy warheads

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,148

No.

Stay back.

19
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,935

Millions lost power tonight.

Did the "heroes" think of that

25
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:16,683
Before they took on this weirdo?

26
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,685
How much longer are we gonna put up

27
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:20,687
With this kind of reckless endangerment

28
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:23,257
And wanton disregard for public safety?

31
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:29,045
Friends, the will of the people must be heard,

32
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,648
So I want you to call on our government,

33
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,318
No, on all the world's governments

34
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,820
To ban the Jus-us League!

35
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:38,805
They can't do that.

36
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:39,990
We have a contract.

Artie: Not anymore. Energy bars, track shoes--

38
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:45,678
No one will touch you, not even public access.

39
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:48,315
But Godfrey's full of it. Why-- not to worry.

40
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,800
Remember, no such thing as bad publicity.

41

Your name's on everyone's lips.

That's a good thing.

I can't remember.

The Anti-Fusion device is gone.

What did you do with it?

I told you. I don't remember anything.

What makes you think I took it?

58

You took the other weapons from the base.

59
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,717
The A.F.D. Isn't a weapon.

60
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:27,337
It's purely defensive. It stops nuclear fusion.

Unless you're planning to go knock out a star,

62

The only thing it's good for

63
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:32,692
Is protection against nuclear attack.

Why did he attack my friend?

Heart of darkness.

124

Any who touched dark heart

125
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,842
Are possessed by vengeful spirits.

126
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,079
Their only goal-- destroy humanity.

127
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:52,852
Since that time, Mophir’s people guard dark heart.

128
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,455
Mophir is latest to guard diamond.

129

But why attack the princess?

Let's say I believe you.

137
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:14,390
How do we stop it or them?

138
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,842
2 ways.

139

Drives spirits back into heart of darkness.

141
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,719
Great. What's the second way?

142
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:28,271
Separate host head from body.

143
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,557

Flash: So these dead snake guys are inside Diana,

145
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,763
And they want to destroy the world.

146
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,681
This is a grave development.

147
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,317
I'm glad you believe me.

148
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,069
I know this Mophir guy sounds Looney.

149
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,322
Diana has been acting strangely since her recovery.

150
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,373
We should keep an eye on her.

151
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,458
Right. I'm on it.

152
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,466
So how are you?

153
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,852
Fine, I guess,

154
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,636
But everything's still a blur.

155
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,388
Just take it easy for a while,

156
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:04,074
And don't make any sudden moves.

157
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,075
What?

158
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,559
Uh, nothing.

159
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:12,048
J'onn, I have an idea.

160
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:14,367
Can you do one of those Martian mind probes on Diana?

161
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,602
Not now.

162
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:17,203
There's been a breach in our security.

163
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:19,238
Where? In the javelin bay.

164
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:20,757
Didn't I tell you?

165
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,043
It's that vengeance snakethingy. It's inside Diana.

166
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,277
Impossible.

167
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,145
She's been in the medical bay the whole time.

168
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,747
But it's got to be her.

169
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:29,215
Before we start pointing fingers,

170
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:32,619
Call up the javelin bay security tapes.

171
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,088

I have no memory of doing this.

Ok, that crazy old coot said

178
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,930
This would drive out the bad spirits.

Come on, be serious.

You've got to admit something weird is going on here,

So unless you got a better plan...

182
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,689
Hold still.

183

Pathetic humans.

But you might want to warn us next time before you...

194
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,950
Uh-oh.

195
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,855
This has got to be a nightmare.

196
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:35,238
When the sun comes up, you'll all still be human...

Whew!

Diana: How fitting for the humans to die

By their own weapon of war.

207
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:53,986
When this hits the sun, the star will collapse.

And the descendants of the mammals

Who destroyed our proud people

210

Maybe you're right. Maybe it is hopeless.

Why curse the dark

If you're lucky.

243
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,867
We have a situation.

244
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:48,788
How can we stop it?

245
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:50,256
J'onn: There is one possibility.

246
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,208
To halt the process,

247
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,610
We would need to create an Einstein-Rosen bridge

248
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:57,079
To drain off the infecting Anti-Fusion matter.

249
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,764
Create a what to do what?

250
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,883
Make a wormhole to suck away the bad stuff.

251

Oh.

252
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:03,585
We can use the javelin.

253
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,488
It's got a wormhole generator for interstellar travel.

Uh...

255
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,156
More bad news.

256
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,877
How long will it take to repair? Too long.

257
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,714
We don't need the whole ship, just the generator.

258
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,266
But without the ship's engines behind it,

259
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:18,868
We'll never get close enough to light speed

260
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,886
For the generator to trigger a wormhole.

261
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,771
Even I can't fly that fast.

Give Flash the generator. Excuse me?

00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,761
I'll use my ring to give you a running start.

265
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:30,562
Our combined speeds might be enough

266
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,132
To get the generator to open the wormhole.

267
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,499
That's crazy.

You've got a better idea?

269
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,575
According to J'onn's calculations,

270
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,311
The wormhole has to open

271
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,413
Exactly 7 1/2 minutes into the run.

272
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,164
Any earlier, it'll be too far from the sun

273
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:50,599
To have an effect.

274
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,968
Any later and you risk tearing the sun apart

275
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,703
Through the wormhole. Got it?

276
