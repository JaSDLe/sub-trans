00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,769
[thinking] I'm receiving your directions

2
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,704
And relaying them to my teammates.

3
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:20,806
Please be assured that we are doing

4
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,374
Everything within our power

5
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:24,110
To save your world.

00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:33,052
[speaking alien language]

7
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,453
You gave us the knowledge

8
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:36,022
To construct the gravitation device

9
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:39,125
And trusted the League to be your hands.

10
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:41,127
We will not fail you.

11
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:15,861
Status report, Flash.

12
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:19,365
Just keep beaming those instructions into my head, J’onn.

13
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:22,368
I should have this baby up and running right about...

14
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,969
Now!

15
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,361
[speaking excitedly in alien language]

16
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,612
The ice planet's orbit is stabilizing.

17
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:08,948
These two worlds will never collide now.

18
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,682
The Nomitians are sending us

19
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:13,018
Their expressions of relief and gratitude.

20
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,723
Nice way to kick off a Christmas break.

21
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,359
I second that.

22
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:23,429
G.L.?

23
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,830
You guys go ahead.

24
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,531
I'll catch up with you later.

25
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:33,939
I'll hitch a ride back with G.L.

26
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:40,011
How about you, big guy? Any holiday plans?

27
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:43,215
I'm afraid this season has no meaning for me.

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,221
Whoa. Frosty.

29
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,790
We'll have to do something about that.

30
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,370
G.L.: Ya-hoo!

31
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,641
You fly through space all the time,

32
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:19,978
But sliding down a snowy hill makes you shriek like a child?

33
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,181
Each winter, my grandmother would take me sledding in the park.

34
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,517
It was the best part of Christmas.

35
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,119
With all respect to your grandmother,

36
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:29,687
I don't see what's so special about the snow.

37
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:45,637
That's clever.

38
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,039
How about this?

39
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:53,579
It's a snow angel. See my wings?

40
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,082
Right.

41
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,685
Hey! What was that for?

42
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,353
<i>It's supposed to be fun.</i>

43
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,121
Ok.

44
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:04,923
Let's have fun.

45
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,358
Whoa!

46
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:13,031
Lady, you are asking for it.

47
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:19,471
Bring it on, snowman!

48
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:22,407
Woman: He'll be here any minute, kids.

49
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,209
That jolly man in the red suit

50
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,044
Is coming to pay his Christmas visit.

51
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:27,512
Ho ho ho!

52
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:29,481
All right! Yay!

53
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:30,849
You're the coolest!

54
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,017
Merry Christmas, guys!

55
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,885
Have you been good this year?

56
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,121
Yes! Yes! Yes!

57
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,589
You can bet they've been good

58
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:39,625
When it means seeing their favorite hero.

59
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,493
Don't forget the present he brings.

60
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,995
Yeah! Yeah!

61
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,363
You really don't have to do that.

62
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:46,665
Come on. It's tradition.

63
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,767
What's it going to be this year, guys?

64
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,602
A video game? Sports equipment?

65
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:52,437
<i>Well, there is something.</i>

66
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,939
Name it.

67
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:55,174
It's on! It's on!

68
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,009
It's on! It's on! All right!

69
00:05:57,011 --> 00:06:00,112
T.V.: It's D.J. Rubba Duckee!

70

# I'm the Rubba Duckee with all the fly moves #

Flash: Ha ha ha!

77
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,899
That actually is pretty cool.

78
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,300
Ok.

79
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:24,102
D.J. Rubba Duckee it is.

80
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:27,539
Uh, you may not want to get their hopes up too high.

81
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,641
Every store's been sold out for weeks.

82
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:32,577
Please. I made Gorilla Grodd cry uncle.

83
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,580
I'm sure Rubba Duckee will be no problem.

84
00:06:35,582 --> 00:06:36,982
All right! Yay!

J'onn: This is a bad idea.

Superman: No way was I going to leave you alone

88

In the Watchtower on Christmas eve.

89
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,392
Besides, Batman practically begged for monitor duty.

90
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:48,493
You'll love it. Trust me.

91

Hi, ma. Pa.

93
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,701
Merry Christmas.

94
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,536
Have you been eating, dear?

95
00:06:58,538 --> 00:06:59,671
You look thin.

96
00:06:59,673 --> 00:07:00,872
Oh, ma.

97
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,841
Good to have you home again, son.

98
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:05,710
It's good to be back. And I brought a friend.

99
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,880
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Kent.

100
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,315
I hope I'm not intruding.

00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:16,121
Uh, Clark was most insistent I join you for the holiday.

103
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:18,456
My name is J’onn.

104
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,558
I'm a Martian.

105

Oh, we're no strangers to aliens in this house.

106
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,630
You just make yourself at home.

107
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:27,199
That reminds me. Where's Kara?

108
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,201
Skiing with Barbara. She'll be home for new year's.

109
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,904
As long as she's not here, you can have her room.

110
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,743
Superman: You should be nice and cozy here, J’onn.

111
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,245
Nice and cozy?

112
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:43,015
How odd to hear you speak that way.

113
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,551
I've never seen this side of you, Clark.

114
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,453
That's why I like coming home for the holidays.

115
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,688
I can just relax and be myself.

116
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,858
Pa Kent: Ok, everybody! I'm turning on the Christmas tree!

Unh!

Feeling more festive?

I don't know.

135
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:58,256
I still don't get this whole obsession with the holidays.

I may never get home, but I have found one planet

Where the people celebrated

141
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:08,933
The same way.

142

Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

143
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,637
You wouldn't like it.

144
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,410
I have a day off

Go smack him up.

Honest, people, we're completely sold out!

Come back after the holidays!

We are happy to give it with our compliments.

00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:43,660
Haven't I seen enough of you for one night?

341
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,162
I wanted to say thanks.

342
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,696
You really helped me out.

343
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,631
I did it for the children.

344
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:52,135
I welcome any opportunity to bring culture to the uncorrupted.

345
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:55,939
Sure. But I thought you might like some holiday cheer yourself.

346
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,575
An aluminum Christmas tree?

347
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:00,711
I know. It's kind of cheesy, but--

348
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:04,581
No, no. We had one just like it when I was...

349
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,949
It's very nice.

350
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,851
The guard will show you out.

351
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:46,223
Merry Christmas, John.

And he said he didn't bring a gift.
