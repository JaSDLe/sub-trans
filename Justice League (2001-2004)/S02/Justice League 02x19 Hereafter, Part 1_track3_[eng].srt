1
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:13,159
We have all been wronged by the same man.

2
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,261
We have. We have.

3
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,947
We all seek the same redress.

4
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:20,349
We do. We do.

5
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,001
We agree to work together

6
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,070
To achieve our ultimate goal.

7
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:25,688
We will. We will.

8
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,824
Speak your names.

9
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,209
Toyman.

10
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:32,579
Livewire.

11
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,081
Weather Wizard.

12
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,250
Kalibar.

13
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:41,187
Metallo.

14
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,591
Speak the word and seal the pact.

15
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,996
Together: Revenge.

16
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,166
[sirens]

17
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,742
You said he'd come.

18
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,243
A matter of time.

19
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,812
He's unaccountably fond of this dump.

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,681
The cops seem fond of it, too.

21
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,054
Toyman, isn't that thing ready yet?

22
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,189
Toyman: Just finishing up.

23
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,349
Everybody down!

24
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,400
[shouting]

25
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,771
Nice.

26
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:39,005
I'm sensing something's moving

27
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:42,208
Through the local air mass, heading this way fast.

28
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:43,643
The rat's taken the cheese.

29
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,579
You ready, Toyman?

30
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:49,632
You bet. This will be fun.

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,668
Uh-oh. Wrong rat.

32
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,374
Watch out for iron giant.

33
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:00,043
Those darts are no joke.

34
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,512
Xxx: Copy that. I'm only a few minutes away.

35
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,881
Be careful. This is obviously an ambush.

36
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,366
Livewire: Those guys travel in bunches.

37
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:08,001
Maybe we should call this off.

38
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,419
Excellent advice.

39
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,170
Aah!

40
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,224
Grr! Oh!

41
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,425
Incoming!

42
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:31,141
Windy.

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,743
I gathered.

44
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,133
There are so many reasons

45
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,784
Why that shouldn't have worked.

46
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,209
Our next priority is to get rid of Metallo.

47
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:50,660
I got an idea.

48
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,461
Hang on.

49
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,766
J'onn, make yourself scarce.

50
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,504
Aah!

51
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,840
Looks like Supes is gonna miss the party.

52
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:08,811
Give us some more cover.

53
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,964
The Amazon's mine.

54
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:16,285
[screaming]

55
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,167
Maybe you should get a strap for this.

56
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,057
That all you got?

57
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,808
Not quite.

58
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,380
Impressive, little man.

59
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,283
If you stand down right now,

60
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,502
I'll let you live to tell the story.

61
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,281
I just flattened Wonder Woman.

62
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:20,366
You really think you can beat me?

63
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,851
I'm not trying to beat you.

64
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,486
I'm trying to stall you.

65
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:25,871
Stall me? For what?

66
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,879
Ah... Ooh!

67
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,798
For what it's worth, I don't think

68
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:37,650
You could have taken Batman, either.

69
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,719
Rain, rain, go away.

70
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,323
Little Johnny wants to play.

71
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,991
[machine whirring]

72
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:12,118
Give it up, Toyman.

73
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:13,886
You'll never hit me with that thing.

74
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:16,906
Maybe not, but what about your friends?

75
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,678
No!

76
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:28,467
Aah!

77
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:37,193
Superman go bye-bye.

78
00:06:57,214 --> 00:07:00,400
Stay back. It's full of acid.

79
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,385
Aah!

80
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,889
Do I look like I'm playing games?

81
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,858
What are you gonna do to me?

82
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,262
I'm gonna punch a hole in your head.

83
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,230
We don't do that to our enemies.

84
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,965
Speak for yourself.

85
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:17,917
I'm trying to speak for Superman.

86
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:40,924
This is Snapper Carr, returning to our continuing coverage

87
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,992
of the death of Superman.

88
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,928
I'm here at first Metropolis cathedral,

89
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,629
Where just hours from now,

90
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,981
services will be held for the world's greatest hero.

91
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:51,751
In addition to friends, colleagues, and loved ones,

92
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,437
Heads of state from over 400 countries

93
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,939
Are expected to attend today.

94
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,542
In the streets of Metropolis, as in cities all over the world,

95
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,493
Thousands have gathered

96
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:05,782
To pay their last respects to the Man of Steel.

97
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,883
Our all-day live coverage will conclude

98
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:10,536
following Superman's ceremonial interment later this evening.

99
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,972
Afterwards, our panel of commentators and pundits

100
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,291
Will debate the question on everyone's lips--

101
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,893
Without Superman, can there be a Justice League?

102
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:21,814
Our coverage of the death of Superman will continue.

103
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,817
I must admit...

104
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,486
I'm also concerned about the League's future.

105
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,054
I never expected to hear

106
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,439
That kind of talk from you, J'onn.

107
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,407
How many battles did we win

108
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,359
Simply because he was there?

109
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:35,995
Yeah. I used to be able to goof around so much

110
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,298
Because I knew Superman had my back.

111
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:42,018
Now all I've got is his example,

112
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,055
And that's gonna have to be enough.

113
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,194
What is it, Alfred?

114
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:10,913
I'm afraid it's time, master Bruce.

115
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,698
I'm not going to the funeral.

116
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:13,799
Why?

117
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,768
Because he's not dead.

118
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,525
What tipped me off was the lack of evidence.

119
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:23,643
Sir?

120
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,179
I brought all this from the crime scene,

121
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,364
And I've examined it every way I know how.

122
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:29,665
And you found?

123
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,200
Absolutely nothing.

124
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,987
No scorching, no residue, no radiation.

125
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,105
Objects were here, then they were gone.

126
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,107
I'm afraid I don't understand.

127
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,193
Matter can't be created or destroyed,

128
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,545
Just changed from one form into another.

129
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:43,896
As you say, sir.

130
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:45,731
I believe I heard something about that

131
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,467
When I attended grammar school.

132
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:50,253
So, unless the law of conservation of mass has been repealed,

133
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:51,871
There's still hope.

134
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,624
That's... wonderful news, master Bruce.

135
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,559
Nevertheless, don't you think

136
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:58,060
You should make an appearance?

137
00:09:58,128 --> 00:09:59,179
What for?

138
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,130
I've got work to do.

139
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:17,763
Batman hasn't arrived.

140
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:19,482
Have you spoken with him?

141
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,667
He's still not answering calls.

142
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,602
He doesn't handle loss very well.

143
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,104
[excited murmuring]

144
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,656
Is that him now?

145
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:28,274
I can't see.

146
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,709
I can.

147
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,849
Luthor, how dare you show your face here?

148
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:38,668
Lois, I--

149
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,203
You've come to gloat.

150
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,455
You've tried to get rid of him for years.

151
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,239
Are you happy now?

152
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,209
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

153
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:49,629
I hate you! I hate you!

154
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,197
[sobbing]

155
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:57,953
Believe it or not, I'm going to miss him, too.

156
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,627
J'onn: Though we gather here today,

157
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:06,829
Bound together in sorrow and loss,

158
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:09,081
We share a precious gift.

159
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,852
We are all of us privileged to live a life

160
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:16,005
That has been touched by Superman.

161
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:19,525
The Man of Steel possessed many extraordinary gifts,

162
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:22,595
And he shared them with us freely.

163
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,598
None of these gifts were more remarkable

164
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,601
Than his ability to discern what needed to be done

165
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:31,104
And his unfailing courage in doing it,

166
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,172
Whatever the personal cost.

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,210
Let us all strive to accept his gift and pass it along,

168
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,598
As an ongoing tribute to Kal-El of krypton,

169
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:44,166
The immigrant from the stars

170
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:47,737
Who taught us all how to be heroes.

171
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,763
[laughter]

172
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:21,488
And Superman holds the grenade in his hands like this.

173
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,007
So it blows, and he doesn't even move.

174
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,076
And I say, "are you all right?"

175
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:27,660
And he says--

176
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:29,062
This is the best part.

177
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,914
He says, "fine. And you?"

178
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,866
[laughter]

179
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,555
To Superman.

180
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:41,607
Together: To Superman.

181
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:45,912
Perhaps this isn't the best time,

182
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,898
But we need to consider replenishing our forces.

183
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:51,450
A new member? Who? Aquaman maybe?

184
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:52,451
Metamorpho.

185
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,587
Is Supergirl old enough?

186
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,107
Before we look outside, we should start with family.

187
00:12:58,175 --> 00:12:59,959
Batman, this is Diana.

188
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:01,578
Go ahead.

189
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:04,030
We're discussing the future of the Justice League.

190
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:05,682
We're hoping you'll make it official

191
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,267
And become a full-time member.

192
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:10,152
I'm busy. Batman out.

193
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,837
Yeah, Aquaman could definitely pick up

194
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:14,423
Batman's slack in the pompous jerk department.

195
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:17,043
He's grieving. Give him time.

196
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:31,407
What's with all the long faces, justice dweebs?

197
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,842
It's like a wake in here.

198
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,163
Lighten up. The answer to all your problems has arrived.

199
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,415
Since we're going to be working together,

200
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,218
you can call me Lobo.

201
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,774
You are not welcome here.

202
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,942
This is a private gathering.

203
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,812
Yeah, yeah. Superman kicked the bucket.

204
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,229
That's why I'm here.

205
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:57,082
I don't know you, but I'm pretty sure I don't like you.

206
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,886
Good instinct. His name's Lobo.

207
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:01,353
He's a lowlife bounty hunter.

208
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,155
The main man happens to be

209
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:05,191
The best bounty hunter in the known universe.

210
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,625
You could ask Superman,

211
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,561
If he weren't busy pushing up daisies.

212
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:09,862
Hey, don't talk about him like that.

213
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,613
Superman was our friend.

214
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:14,317
Mine, too. I saved his life once, you know.

215
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:16,419
That's not how he told the story.

216
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,353
Whatever. The point is, Superman bit the big one,

217
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:22,407
And the main man's here to take his place.

218
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:26,929
You're no Superman.

219
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:29,131
The ladies say different.

220
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,188
Stay down.

221
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,556
On the contrary,

222
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:39,057
Get up and leave.

223
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,526
The Justice League

224
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,027
Does not require your services

225
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,662
At this or any other time.

226
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,331
Now I get it. You clowns don't think

227
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,366
The main man is tough enough

228
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,368
To join your little girl scout troop.

229
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,870
Easy mistake to fix.

230
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,372
You want an audition?

231
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:57,409
Come on, ladies. Let's dance.

232
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,449
[faint beeping]

233
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:06,919
Another dead-end.

234
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:10,289
I'm beginning to wonder if I might be wrong.

235
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:12,241
I've got some things to say.

236
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,161
I should have said them when you were here, but...

237
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:17,796
Despite our differences,

238
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:20,399
I have nothing but respect for you.

239
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:24,003
<i>I hope you knew... Know that.</i>

240
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:25,638
You showed me that justice

241
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:27,723
Doesn't always have to come from the darkness.

242
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,408
I'll miss--

243
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,944
[distant explosions]

244
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,846
What did you always call it, Clark?

245
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:35,681
"the never-ending battle"?

246
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:41,971
[woman screaming]

247
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:54,750
This is hopeless. We may as well

248
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:56,469
Be throwing candy corn at them.

249
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:58,086
So, what do you want to do--

250
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,372
Give them the city?

251
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,996
You think your pitiful human prison can hold me?

252
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:12,051
This looks like a job for Superman,

253
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:15,837
But I don't think he's coming.

254
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:51,907
Heh heh heh!

255
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,367
Hyah!

256
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,144
Yah!

257
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,951
Aah!

258
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,003
Uh...

259
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,088
[distant sirens]

260
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:29,061
Too bad. He was kind of cute.

261
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,465
Come on, Green Longjohns. Let me out of here

262
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:36,235
So I can go upside your head.

263
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:37,969
[whistles]

264
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,089
[engine revving]

265
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:46,095
Remember to look both ways before you cross me.

266
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,949
Huh?

267
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,769
You talk too much.

268
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,257
Oh...

269
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,975
You want to settle down now?

270
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,610
Please say no.

271
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:02,445
[whistles]

272
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,332
I got it.

273
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,783
Whoo-hoo!

274
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,904
Ah! Ah! Ooh! Ah!

275
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:15,140
All right, that's it!

276
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,247
Flash: I'm ok!

277
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:23,732
All right, already. I guess I'll let

278
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,250
You all stay on the team with me,

279
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:26,702
But I'm the leader.

280
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:27,920
Ow!

281
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:31,040
The Justice League is about more than physical power.

282
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,943
It's about ideals, caring, helping.

283
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,112
Buy me a ticket to Pukesville.

284
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,029
All right, all right.

285
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,598
Say what you want,

286
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,600
But the Justice League needs the main man.

287
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,102
Green Lantern: He might be right.

288
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,337
Reporter on screen: Metropolis is under siege.

289
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:46,788
Following a mass jailbreak,

290
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,624
Dozens of supervillains are running amok downtown,

291
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,943
Apparently in celebration of the recent loss of--

292
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:55,147
Lobo: You ain't gonna be sorry you brought the main man.

293
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:56,799
Right. Like we were going to

294
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,500
Leave you alone in the Watchtower.

295
00:18:58,568 --> 00:18:59,885
But long as I'm here,

296
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,603
I get to bust heads.

297
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:04,106
You will do precisely as we instruct--

298
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,158
No more, no less.

299
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:09,211
Sure thing. Finders keepers on any bounties, right?

300
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,146
You need to be quiet now.

301
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,785
Get your own money.

302
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,703
There's plenty.

303
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:30,466
Guess that was a little too much to hope for.

304
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,278
[screaming]

305
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,766
Aah!

306
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,869
Aah!

307
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:53,788
Uh!

308
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:55,974
Lobo: Hey, hat hair!

309
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,559
Want a piece of me?

310
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,684
Wuss.

311
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,252
[groaning]

312
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,738
I'm gonna grind you into paste.

313
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:12,708
Awful brave talk for a dead man.

314
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,376
I'm not dead yet.

315
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:15,861
You're right.

316
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:18,263
My watch is about 10 seconds fast.

317
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,335
[groaning]

318
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:25,671
Uh!

319
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:32,661
Uh!

320
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:42,387
Aah!

321
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:49,128
Does that account for everyone?

322
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:54,066
Say it. Say it.

323
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:57,402
Uncle.

324
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:03,374
I can't hear you.

325
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:08,731
He's beaten. Put the car down.

326
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,252
I was gonna.

327
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,821
Pretty good, huh?

328
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,372
When you got Lobo on your team,

329
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,824
Who needs Superman?
