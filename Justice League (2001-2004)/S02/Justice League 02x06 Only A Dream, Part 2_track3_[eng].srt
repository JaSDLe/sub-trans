So, it's true!

00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:13,105
This thing really can give people E.S.P.

4
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:19,646
You can't do this.

5
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:20,914
I was so close.

6
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:22,716
You can't do this to me!

7
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,488
Aah! Aah!

00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:32,291
Aah!

00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,228
Not even the Justice League can save you now.

10
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:38,398
And now that I'm a doctor,

11
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:41,568
I think I'll perform some surgery.

12

He calls himself Doctor Destiny now.

13
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:46,573
He came into her dreams...

14
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:48,108
Did this to her.

15
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:49,309
Why can't she wake up?

16
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:53,446
It's a delusional state. He wants us, too.

It's... A bad person, I guess.

Ok... So, why didn't you just say that?

Well, I...

30
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,965
And do people really talk so much when they fight?

- Are you French? - No.

37
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:09,882
Then there's no food.

Anybody?

47
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:11,410
You went too fast...

48

And you're never going to be able

Now I get it! It's a dream.

Same one I've been having

52

Ever since I got my speed.

53
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:30,630
And here's where the Swedish bikini team

54
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:31,631
Comes in to keep me company.

Anyway, all I gotta do

Wake up?

It's the alarm next to my bed,

00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:55,254
And as soon as I get it,

69
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:56,189
I'm out of here.

70
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:57,190
See you next time

That never happened before.

76
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,502
That's because there's not going to be

77
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,270

Is it?

I must have gotten it

Too close to the candle.

You're hiding something.

In fact, you're always hiding something.

No. Any luck with Superman?

122
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,289
I gave him some stimulants, but...

123
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:44,224
This is someone who could have

124
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,725
A building fall on him and not feel it.

125
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,293
I'll try the bio-regenerators

Good luck.

And in the meantime, I'm gonna find this guy.

How?

130
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,069
While he's using his mental powers,

131
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:57,670
His body's probably vulnerable.

132
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,340
He's got to be in a place he thinks is safe...

133
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:01,374
Somewhere familiar.

134
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,609
Reasonable.

135
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:03,809
But once you find him,

136
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:05,812
How do you stop him from... thinking?

137
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,648
I'll just have to improvise.

138
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:10,082
Be careful!

139
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,785
If you nod off for even a second...

140
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,554
Don't worry. I'm used to late hours.

There was this telepath

I know. How did you...

I'm not sure.

The others are getting worse.

I'm going to have to go into their minds.

Too dangerous!

178
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,529
You could end up just like them.

179
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:06,999
If I don't, they'll die for sure.

180
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,900
There was a news report.

Dee's wife didn't make it.

J'onn: It's not real! None of it!

00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,150
I started with no power at all,

00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,852
And I kept getting more.

What if it never stops?

00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:03,589
You will handle it. I know you.

Words... Just words.

195

We can fight this.

196
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,728
You'll get hurt.

00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,764
No. I am stronger here than you are.

Uh!

00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,302
I can take this from you.

By the Justice League.
