1
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,076
Galius: It was a setup!

2
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,946
And we walked right into it!

3
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:43,482
Uh! Shut up, Galius!

4
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:46,818
Aah!

5
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,391
This was supposed to be a simple extraction.

6
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,234
Fall back and regroup.

7
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:24,056
Galius, Hawkus, take the right and left flanks and squeeze!

8
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,283
Your contact in the resistance obviously missed a detail or two.

9
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:28,319
Quit griping and just do our job.

10
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:38,930
This is pointless.

11
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:40,098
We need more altitude.

12
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,033
I'm with you.

13
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,367
Stop!

14
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:44,803
You're not dealing with raw recruits here, Katma.

15
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,338
Wait!

16
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,909
Oh, no.

17
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:54,913
No! Uh!

18
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:57,216
Kilowog, we've got to warn the Guardians.

19
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:58,883
I'm not leaving without you!

20
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:01,553
No. I'll have to cover your escape. It's the only way.

21
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,221
Uh! Katma!

22
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,323
I'm in charge here, Kilowog.

23
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,125
Now go!

24
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,002
Go!

25
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,155
[straining]

26
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:55,033
No! I said rotate the securing bolts counterclockwise,

27
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,201
Not clockwise.

28
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:57,203
That's what I did.

29
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,670
Oh, no, you didn't.

30
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:01,874
Wait. Didn't you tell me that the clocks on Thanagar...

31
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:03,341
move in the opposite direction than those on Earth?

32
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:05,176
I never said that.

33
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:06,945
Oh, yes, you did.

34
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:09,180
Hey, you two want to keep it down?

35
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,448
You sound like an old married couple.

36
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:13,786
That's better.

37
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,422
[alarm sounds]

38
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,824
Now what?

39
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:22,760
Perimeter alert! We've got a contact coming in fast.

40
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:24,095
A meteor?

41
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:25,901
Don't think so. I'm reading a life sign.

42
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,967
A possible incursion.

43
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,869
Only one way to find out.

44
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:30,936
I'll get J’onzz.

45
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,757
Oh, no.

46
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,167
[groans]

47
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:05,169
Hey, it's Kilowog.

48
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,839
Kilowog, what happened?

49
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:11,009
Kilowog: J'onn, they got her.

50
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,744
They got Kat.

51
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:14,012
Uh...

52
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,616
Who got her? Kilowog!

53
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,621
Take care of him.

54
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:27,325
What just happened?

55
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,733
It's lucky for the Big K we've got Martian care on our League HMO.

56
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:37,802
Bolovax physiology is very similar to my own.

57
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,538
And how much of this is guesswork?

58
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,774
I would rather not say.

59
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:51,816
[groans]

60
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,017
Hey, big guy.

61
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,319
Hey, you little poozer.

62
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:56,588
He'll be all right now.

63
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,857
Great. Can we keep him?

64
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:03,228
Kilowog: It's called the Legion of the Third Eye.

65
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,230
A fanatical cult from the planet Kalanor.

66
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:08,267
They invaded Ranstad-7, so we were called in.

67
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,337
Our orders were simple-- bring in their boss, Despero,

68
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,838
Short-circuit his advantage.

69
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:15,373
Sounds like they sent you packing instead.

70
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,009
We underestimated Despero's real power.

71
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:19,044
They others never had a chance.

72
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:21,113
I was lucky to get this far.

73
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,716
I lost some good friends back there.

74
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,085
And what about this Katma Tui?

75
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:29,387
I'm not sure what happened to her.

76
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:30,623
She was the Green Lantern who trained John.

77
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,391
They must have been close.

78
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,925
Very close.

79
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,295
He was teacher's pet?

80
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:37,830
Go, G.L.

81
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,334
Not a good sign.

82
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,508
Must have had some heavy ordinance to take out a g-class cruiser.

83
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,719
I just hope you survived, Kat.

84
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,656
Found you.

85
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,870
What did I tell you?

86
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:53,471
Contraband.

87
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,374
You know Despero’s law forbids you to read.

88
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:59,244
I beg Despero’s forgiveness.

89
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,546
I praise his name.

90
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:01,847
Despero is the beginning.

91
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,515
Despero is the end.

92
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,784
Wrong. We are the end.

93
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:10,188
Can't we all just get along?

94
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,356
Oh!

95
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,791
That's all you have to say?

96
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:15,527
Despero, save us! Despero, save us!

97
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:18,163
Not this time. Good night.

98
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:23,969
You can demonstrate your gratitude

99
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:25,370
By giving me some information.

100
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,772
Despero, forgive me!

101
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,375
Wait!

102
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,843
[crowd murmuring]

103
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,982
Well, good job, Stewart.

104
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,218
This kind of attention I don't need.

105
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,722
We can't raise John on the comlink.

106
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,090
That's no surprise.

107
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,159
Kalanor's at the fringe of the galaxy.

108
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,729
What a cruddy place for Katma to get stuck.

109
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:50,963
If she's even still alive.

110
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,764
Last time I saw her, she was,

111
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:54,300
But I just don't know.

112
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:57,002
Well, we can't let John face this Despero alone.

113
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,737
Can you take us to Kalanor?

114
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:01,941
I'm ok now, but my ring's completely drained.

115
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,508
I need my Lantern battery.

116
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:05,377
Doesn't John have one?

117
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:07,880
Ah!

118
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:09,548
You're right, you little poser.

119
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,849
Of course he does.

120
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,184
Do you know where he keeps it?

121
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:13,518
I thought you might know.

122
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,844
What do you want?

123
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:40,579
Nothing that concerns you.

124
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:43,549
It does concern me if you're breaking into Katma's quarters.

125
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,850
Do you know Katma Tui?

126
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,352
I'm Radocko, her friend,

127
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,220
But I don't know you.

128
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,256
I think you should leave.

129
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,557
I'm here on business from Despero.

130
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,227
Now, if you'd like to avoid trouble...

131
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,797
Uh, not a problem. I-- I apologize, sir.

132
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:05,871
Stealth and guile, Katma. You were always right about that.

133
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,726
Kat, where are you?

134
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,395
Aah!

135
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:43,708
Well, what do you know?

136
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:45,277
G.L.'s a neatnik.

137
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,712
So, where do we start?

138
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,714
Most Lanterns stash their batteries in a hidden pocket dimension.

139
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:52,317
This should just take a second.

140
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,888
Cool. Let me know when you find it.

141
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,357
I don't think he keeps it in there.

142
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:02,027
I'm not looking for a lamp.

143
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:06,364
You're not the only one who needs a recharge, old pal of mine.

144
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,867
Aha! I knew it!

145
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,570
Jonny does have a chink in his armor.

146
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,141
Bob and Terry's?

147
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,110
Delicious.

148
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:21,280
Right. Stick with me, big guy.

149
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:24,182
I'll open up a whole new world for you.

150
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,618
Flash: Hey, check this out.

151
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:29,287
<i>People's exhibit "b," Old Yeller.</i>

152
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:32,157
Delicious.

153
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,427
What else can we find?

154
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:38,297
Ah! Ah!

155
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,264
Good Lord!

156
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:40,231
What is it?

157
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,267
What are you doing in my building?

158
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:44,870
And why are you wearing Mr. Stewart's clothes?

159
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,138
Uh, ma'am, we can explain.

160
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:48,340
Ya!

161
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,275
Ouch! Lady, please!

162
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,912
Woman: Mr. Stewart has told me about monsters like you.

163
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,949
Well, I'm not a- going to let you suck out my brain.

164
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,851
Ow! Lady, we're his friends,

165
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,019
The good guys!

166
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,421
Found it!

167
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:06,558
Flash: Knock it off, lady! I'm gonna--ow!

168
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:08,560
Ooh!

169
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:11,730
What are you waiting for? Ow!

170
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,431
Doh!

171
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:16,502
Nice meeting you, ma'am.

172
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,537
If we ever need a replacement for Hawkgirl--

173
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,038
And don't come back!

174
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,634
Another Green Lantern.

175
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,537
This is getting monotonous.

176
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:56,107
But I'm sure it's not your fault.

177
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:59,943
You were, after all, just following your master's orders.

178
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:02,013
Despero, I presume.

179
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,784
All: Despero is all!

180
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:09,287
With a backup group, no less.

181
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:11,589
The Guardians would be wise to step aside.

182
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,258
A new order to the universe is coming,

183
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:16,460
One that will be written in fire

184
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,729
And with the blood of all who oppose me.

185
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:21,766
You would be wise to join me.

186
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,568
I don't know what you're selling,

187
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,902
But I'm not buying.

188
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,004
What you want is irrelevant.

189
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:29,339
The only will that matters is mine,

190
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:33,243
The one true voice of the flame of Py'tar,

191
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:36,881
Such was bestowed upon me in the time of before.

192
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:42,987
Despero, voice-over: I was but a simple peasant

193
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:44,855
Cast out because of my deformity.

194
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:55,332
Alone and forlorn, I wandered in the wasteland,

195
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,403
Guided by an unknown hand of fate.

196
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,375
[gasps]

197
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:19,790
It was when I was set upon by a gang of thieves

198
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,892
Bent on taking what little I had

199
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,262
That the ultimate truth was revealed to me.

200
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:33,371
Before the thieves could flee, the ground split asunder.

201
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:35,105
[screaming]

202
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,475
A great flame shot forth and destroyed my assailants.

203
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,225
But I was spared.

204
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,730
My third eye opened, and the flame spoke to me in a voice only I could hear.

205
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:03,633
It told me of a time when Kalanor would become a paradise.

206
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:08,072
Py'tar charged me with the honor of leading my world to greatness

207
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,675
And spreading its light across the galaxy.

208
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:13,210
Huh. Your story sounds a little derivative.

209
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,379
You doubt my word?

210
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:19,183
Behold, the flame if Py’tar.

211
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,925
You built a bonfire.

212
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:31,154
Am I supposed to be impressed?

213
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:33,497
You're not the first skeptic.

214
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:34,966
You will not be the last.

215
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:36,768
[electrical crackling]

216
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,741
Open your eyes that you may see!

217
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,280
Uh!

218
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:52,784
Feel the power of my rage!

219
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:54,152
Uh!

220
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,888
Fell the power of my hate!

221
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,128
Aah!

222
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:09,233
You see the futility of your quest?

223
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,841
Aah!

224
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:26,350
Priestess, throw this one into the flame.

225
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:45,870
Aah!

226
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:55,134
Steady. Increase to 20 megacycles.

227
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,514
[machine powering up]

228
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:07,625
We're losing him.

229
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,127
Switch to backup power. Now!

230
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:12,296
It's no good.

231
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:16,634
That'll do it.

232
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,372
Uh!

233
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:22,806
Oh...

234
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:25,609
What...

235
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:28,312
Welcome to the resistance, fellow non-believer.

236
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:32,015
My name is Shifflet. Radocko here you've met.

237
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,184
I should have guessed that one.

238
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,186
There's always a resistance, isn't there?

239
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:38,121
Wherever there's oppression, there we'll be...

240
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:40,523
I believe the saying goes.

241
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:41,725
Thanks.

242
00:18:41,793 --> 00:18:43,861
Now for the big question:

243
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,295
Why am I alive?

244
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,597
You were plucked from a fiery death

245
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,934
Courtesy of our handy matter transporter.

246
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:53,104
You have a matter transporter?

247
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,671
It's a bit rickety,

248
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:56,607
But it's saved a few like yourself.

249
00:18:56,675 --> 00:19:00,110
Woman: And it was the best I could come up with on short notice.

250
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:04,248
Kat!

251
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:14,592
What are you doing here?

252
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,393
Nice to see you, too.

253
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:17,995
I thought you were in trouble.

254
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:20,664
And since when have you known me to ever need help?

255
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:24,267
I was obviously mistaken.

256
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:30,807
Here. A power ring's not something you leave lying around.

257
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,576
It is when you're working undercover.

258
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:35,312
Undercover?

259
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,980
Coming in through the front door doesn't work here.

260
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:39,350
We lost Arkus and Galius trying.

261
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:40,951
Oh.

262
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:43,320
Fortunately, I got away.

263
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:47,091
They helped hide me, and I've been gathering intelligence ever since.

264
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:50,827
You always said... Stealth and guile.

265
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,762
I'm glad you learned something.

266
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,498
So what is Despero up to?

267
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,933
He's preparing to start a massive world conquest.

268
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:59,403
Rancid 7 was just a test run for him.

269
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,972
I don't know when the real campaign begins.

270
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,108
And thanks to you, I almost lost my cover.

271
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,778
I'm sorry, Kat. I didn't know.

272
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:10,180
Next time, call ahead.

273
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:15,352
So, uh, do you still snore?

274
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,154
I wouldn't know.

275
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:20,123
Well, I'd like to stay and relive old times,

276
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,492
But... The same drill as before.

277
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,461
Duty calls.

278
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:27,097
Duty calls.

279
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,632
I'll go with you.

280
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,468
Uh-uh, John Stewart.

281
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,569
You'll stay here and coordinate with them.

282
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:34,370
But I--

283
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:45,048
Besides, you wouldn't look so good in a brass bikini.

284
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,059
Despero: O flame of Py’tar, the time is at hand.

285
00:20:56,127 --> 00:21:00,063
Infuse me with your power so that I may carry out your will.

286
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,003
Together we will transform Kalanor into a paradise

287
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,907
And spread your light throughout the universe.

288
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:16,679
It begins now.

289
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:20,084
All: All hail Despero!

290
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:23,020
Despero is the beginning!

291
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:26,456
Despero is the end.

292
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:30,260
Despero is all!

293
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:33,897
Despero: Prepare now to receive the gift of Py’tar.

294
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:38,101
Open yourselves to the will of the flame.

295
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,471
[all groaning]

296
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:03,527
Despero: Go!

297
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:06,263
The conquest begins now!

298
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:11,334
Emblazon my word and will across the cosmos!
