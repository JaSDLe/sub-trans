And I thought I'd actually have to break a sweat.

00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:34,743
Superman: I'll be doing the breaking.

7
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,657
Yes, indeed.

8
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,826
You break very nicely.

9
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:53,228
Ha ha ha!

10
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,199
Well done!

11
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,101
Extraordinary!

12
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,170
Congratulations.

13
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,507
You've done what even I couldn't do, Mr...

14
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:08,609
Dee. John Dee.

15
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:12,246
Ew. We'll have to do better than that.

16
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:13,347
Let's see.

17
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:14,882
Dee. Dee.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,184
Destructor?

19
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:17,185
Demolisher!

20
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:18,252
Time for that later.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,354
First Mr. Dee has to tell us

22
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:23,191
Exactly how this thing works.

23
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:24,758
Dee: The materiopticon?

24
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,027
Sorry. It's a trade secret.

25
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,329
That all right.

26
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:30,864
Grundy like you anyway.

27
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,967
You one of us now.

28
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:34,935
Easy. Easy.

29
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,239
Easy.

30
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,474
Huh?

31
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,941
Your turn in the barrel.

32
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,714
What's so easy, John?

00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,015
You were talking in your sleep.

34
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,450
I was just dreaming about my parole.

35
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:51,285
I think it's really gonna happen this time.

36
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:52,620
I wouldn't bet against it.

37
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:54,054
You're not like the other guys here.

38
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:55,256
You got a future.

39
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,396
Yeah, I got a real date with destiny.

That's it?

I don't feel any different.

45
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:24,812
You're not supposed to.

46
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,681
Just let your mind go blank,

47
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:27,849
And tell me what comes into it

48
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,317
When I look at these cards.

49
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,357
Uh... A car maybe.

50
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,059
A tree.

51
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,262
A cow.

52
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,831
A house.

53
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:49,503
Sheez. So it's true.

54
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,973
This thing really can give people E.S.P.

55
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,407
Only for a little while,

56
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,176
And I'm still charting the side effects.

57
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,778
But think of the potential.

58
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,846
I'd sure like to keep working with you on this.

59
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,314
Even after they let me out.

60
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,650
See what this baby can really do.

61
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:05,019
What it could do is fry your brain.

62
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,021
Hey, sometimes you have to take a chance.

63
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:08,456
You know, for science.

64
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:09,990
I appreciate your zeal, but...

[knock on door]

John, your parole report's in.

67
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:34,581
It's just a little setback, that's all.

68
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,285
You said that last time and the time before.

69
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,789
Listen, I'm working on something new.

70
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,190
It's gonna change everything.

71
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,825
You've said that before, too.

72
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,363
Baby, this time it's going to happen, I swear.

73
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,433
John, I found someone else.

74
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:59,940
You can't do this. I'm so close.

75
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,943
You can't do this to me!

76
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,625
Where's that happy face today, Dee?

77
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,893
Shut up.

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,528

What are you doing here?

I was worried about you.

Sometimes they take hostages.

87
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,194
Better lock up.

It's ok. I don't think he's home right now.

What's he working on, anyway?

97
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:10,305
I don't know, but it's probably important,

98
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:11,305
So leave him alone.

Nothing. I was taking a nap.

175
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,298
What for?

176
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,101
You don't know if Dee did this.

177
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,268
I don't know that he didn't.

178
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:08,737
Look, whatever he is,

179
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:09,737
He sure isn't in the same league

180
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,172
As Grundy and the others.

181
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,073
He's a nobody.

182
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:14,275
<i>Ever read the odyssey?</i>

183
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,544
After Odysseus was caught by the cyclops,

184
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,880
He told that his name was nobody,

185
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,215
So when he poked its eye out

186
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:21,716
And its friends asked who did it,

187
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,819
All the cyclops could say was "nobody. "

188
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:26,554
Point taken.

189
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,389
What do you know about John Dee?

190
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,924
I'll get his file for you.

191
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:31,359
I might be able to help.

197
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,021
Maybe it's your conscience.

198
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,757
Oh, I forgot. You don't have one.

199
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,925
How'd you get in here?

200
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,228
I can go anywhere I want now.

201
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:11,132
Rick! Rick!

202
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,933
Get up! Get up!

203
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:15,969
Sound sleeper, huh?

204
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,371
What did you do to him?

205
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,672
Nothing.

206
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,540
But there isn't much he can do for you.

207
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:23,076
Not even the Justice League can save you now.

208
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:25,879
John, please...

209
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,048
You know, I never liked that name.

210
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,550
It's so... Ordinary.

211
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:33,720
Especially for someone who has such big things in store.

212
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:36,223
You know, a destiny.

213
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,060
Oh. Destiny. I like it.

214
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:41,928
Dr. Destiny.

215
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,664
What do you think?

216
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:46,066
You're crazy!

217
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:50,470
I think you're finally seeing the real me.

218
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,308
[gasp]

219
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,420
And now that I'm a doctor,

220
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:09,289
I think I'll perform some surgery.

221
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:12,025
Aah! Aah! Aah!

222

What? What?

Hey, you're just having a nightmare, that's all!

Aah! Aah!

Hold it!

00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,086
Hold what? This?

232
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,788
Huh!

00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:42,990

I heard you knocking.

239
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,929
It was Luminous.

240
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,464
Don't feel too bad about it.

241
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,867
He's fooled others a lot worse.

242

Hey, you ok?

243
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:29,736
Fine.

244
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:34,942
This way.

245
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,843
Grundy say this way.

00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:38,011
But...

247
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,514
Man: Hold it right there, Grundy!

This is as far as you go!

No. Mad.
