<i>Wonder Woman: Previously on Justice League...</i>

00:00:08,683 --> 00:00:10,417
What brings you to the city of lights?

3
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,086
I never miss a good party.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,121
Diana, I'd like to introduce you to my fiancé.

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,957
Vandal Savage is a Nazi war criminal.

6
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:18,992
He was-- my grandfather.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,928
Vandal Savage III.

8
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:22,129
A pleasure to meet you.

9
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:25,799
Look at what we've got so far.

10
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,769
A Kasnian operative stealing military secrets.

11
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:31,334
Kasnia spearheading the International Space Station.

12
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:32,689
Good cover to circumvent

13
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,675
the weapons embargo they're supposed to be under.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,409
Man: Platform one is ours.

15
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:37,811
Different man: It's Wonder Woman.

16
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,746
Why don't you have a word with her?

17
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,552
Aah!

18
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,891
It's the king. He's had a stroke.

19
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,493
If my father cannot rule, my duty is clear.

20
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,762
For the good of Kasnia, I must assume the throne

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,431
Until my father is able again.

22
00:00:57,499 --> 00:00:58,865
The people need reassurance

23
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,967
Of the royal family's continuity.

24
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,337
Our wedding will take place immediately.

25
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,741
Ahh. Ohh.

26
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,775
Easy.

27
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,111
That's quite a shot you took.

28
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,878
I miss anything?

29
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,848
Plenty. Your friend Audrey’s moved up the wedding.

30
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,917
It's happening right now.

31
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:25,352
Like Hades it is.

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,887
You go there uninvited,

33
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,555
You'll be breaking international law.

34
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:30,023
I get my hands on Savage,

35
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,292
That's not all I'll be breaking.

36
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,927
You coming?

37
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:43,971
Hera!

38
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,177

Aah!

<i>[organ playing here comes the bride]</i>

43
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:11,090
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here

44
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,527
In the presence of god and this company

45
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,895
That princess Audrey II of Kasnia

46
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,897
And Vandal Savage may be united

47
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,098
In holy matrimony.

48
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:20,734
This relationship

49
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,970
Is an honorable and sacred one

50
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:25,838
Designed to unite two sympathies and hopes into one,

51
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:31,611
And it rests upon the mutual confidence and devotion of husband and wife.

52
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:37,550
Therefore, it is not by any to be entered into

53
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:41,788
Unadvisedly or lightly

54
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:45,125
But reverently, discreetly, soberly,

55
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,460
And in the fear of god.

56
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:50,163
Into this holy estate

57
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,768
These two persons present come now to be joined.

58
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,905
If anyone has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage,

59
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:02,542
Let them speak now or forever hold their peace.

60
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,645

I won't let you marry him.

Aah!

65
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:17,557
Does anyone else have any objections?

66
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:27,500
Introducing for the first time her royal highness queen Audrey

67
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:30,871
And her husband prince Vandal Savage.

What was Diana thinking?

00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,180
Has she lost her mind?

72
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:42,449
Well, it's obvious she's grown quite attached to you.

73
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,652
I'm fond of her, too, but her behavior is inexcusable.

74
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,020
Banish it from your mind.

75
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:49,088
Today is your wedding day, my beautiful queen.

76
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:51,791
I know that you only married me out of duty,

77
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,593
But when I look into your eyes,

78
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,295
I want to give you the whole world.

79
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:58,164
Sometimes, I almost believe you would if you could.

80
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,134
We'll see.

Where is my husband?

00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:14,547
Attending to a minor diplomatic matter.

84
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,150
I'm to tell you that he will return shortly.

85
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,221
If her majesty requires anything,

86
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,789
I can send a chambermaid for it.

87
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:25,225
If I need any assistance taking a walk,

88
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,592
I'll let you know.

How dare you burst in here and ruin my wedding.

92
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,608
Aren't you even curious about what Savage is up to?

93
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:42,675
He's dangerous.

94
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:44,477
Why? Do you think he might throw a tank

95
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:45,579
Through my wall?

96
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,913
Grow up. He's obviously using you.

97
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,116
He's amassing military and political power.

98
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:50,983
For what?

99
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:52,485
What do you think?

100
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,020
He's got to be stopped!

101
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,988
You're a raving lunatic.

102
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:58,124
Not to say you weren't fun to go clubbing with.

103
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,592
This isn't a joke, Audrey.

104
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,927
I think Savage is responsible

105
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,595
For your father's sudden illness.

106
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:06,533
And I think you've just crossed a line.

107
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,034
Don't walk away, Audrey.

108
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,635
You're making a big mistake!

109
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,238
I can do whatever I please.

110
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,473
Surely you've noticed by now.

111
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:38,932
Busy?

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,733
Merely fortifying our defenses.

113
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:42,668
Wonder Woman penetrated them too easily.

114
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:46,339
She just accused you of being some sort of power-mad monster.

115
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,273
Did she?

116
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,009
We go out live in two minutes.

117
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:49,942
Vandal, what?

118
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,078
Shh!

119
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:52,746
You'll spoil the surprise.

Batman to Watchtower.

122
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,301
Hey. Hope you're having fun.

123
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,337
I'm up here watching the paint dry.

124
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,072
Wonder Woman's being held captive.

125
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,107
She's too well guarded for me to extract her.

126
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,376
Need backup? I'll grab the two Johns, and we'll--

127
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,011
J'onn J'onzz: Flash, Green Lantern,

128
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,146
Join me in the monitor room.

129
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:28,081
We have a developing situation.

130
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,483
What is it? I've got bats on the other line.

131
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:34,287
Well, look who's back.

132
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,356
Today, the world changes.

133
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:38,625
Kasnia is at the forefront of that change.

134
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,194
Crucial to these changes was Kasnia's contribution

135
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,762
To the international space station,

136
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,831
Platform one...

137
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:49,836
A contribution somewhat larger

138
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,204
Than you've been led to believe.

139
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,306
No. Even he wouldn't.

140
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,675
This device is called a mass driver,

141
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:59,179
But I prefer its more colloquial appellation, a railgun.

142
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,014
It's all very complicated.

143
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,382
Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

144
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:07,753
The asteroid is mostly iron ore.

145
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,490
The large coils are a magnetic accelerator.

146
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,661
The target is anywhere I say.

147
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,269
<i>At this time, where is the U.S.S. Avington carrier group,</i>

148
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:24,771
I'd pick up my pace substantially.

149
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:09,382
With our railgun in orbit,

150
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,183
Kasnia has the ultimate high ground.

151
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:15,455
I am now the dominant military power on Earth,

152
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:18,090
And there are going to be some changes.

153
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:20,894
Item one...

154
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,595
J'onn J’onzz: That weapon must be destroyed.

155
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,131
Its destructive potential is unimaginable.

156
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,199
I don't have to imagine it.

157
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,535
I saw the Yungar of Omega Centauri use one

158
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,537
To blow an inhabited moon out of orbit.

159
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,705
You get all that?

160
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,040
Batman: Most of it. We'll have to fend for ourselves.

161
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,942
Taking out that weapon is top priority.

162
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:48,321
What's the plan?

163
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:51,057
Plan? We blow that thing out of the sky.

164
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,626
It is possible that there are still hostages on board.

165
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,396
Astronauts are military. They know the risks.

166
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:58,498
Still, if we can save them, we should.

167
00:10:58,566 --> 00:10:59,699
I concur.

168
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,134
If I were them, I'd want you to save the world,

169
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,403
Not waste time coming back for me.

170
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:05,705
Yeah, but we'd come anyway.

171
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,643
[beeping]

172
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,512
Spotters identify the bogey as the Javelin-7.

173
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,348
May we...

174
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,417
By all means.

175
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,204
[grunting]

176
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,605
I can't control this thing!

177
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:43,009
Counterpull. Avionics are off-line.

178
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,814
Brace yourselves. We're going down.

179
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:15,108
[beeping]

180
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:17,643
Target destroyed.

181
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,012
Vandal, what do you think you're doing?

182
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,547
Destroying the Justice League, building a railgun,

183
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:25,083
Assuming total dominion over the nations of the Earth.

184
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:28,020
You're ranting like your grandfather in an old newsreel.

185
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:30,222
Ha ha ha!

186
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,124
Sweet, foolish child.

187
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,860
Wonder Woman was right all along.

188
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:37,095
Ridiculous. You'd have to be over 100 years old.

189
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,166
I'm far older than that.

190
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:48,040
Savage: The first time a meteor granted me power

191
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:50,609
Was over 25,000 years ago.

192
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,691
While my fellows cowered with fear,

193
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:08,327
I dared approach the strangely glowing rock.

194
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:18,270
It was warm, and the night was very cold.

195
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,906
I slept curled up next to it,

196
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,575
Not realizing what its rays were doing to me,

197
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,010
But over the millennia that followed

198
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:26,179
As I watched those around me grow old and die

199
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,679
While I remained unchanged,

200
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,081
I discovered the truth

201
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,749
And came to accept my destiny.

202
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,684
Destiny?

203
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:35,520
I live to rule.

204
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,557
Delusions of grandeur aside,

205
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,125
I rule Kasnia.

206
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,261
That's why I married you.

207
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:44,029
It's also why I poisoned your father.

208
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:47,366
You... Poisoned?

209
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:48,534
Aah!

210
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,736
Unh!

211
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,571
Unh!

212
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:56,174
[gasp]

213
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:59,845
Guards, confine this brat to her quarters.

214
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,513
Ohh!

215
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,515
Unhand me! I command you!

216
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,318
Let me go! Unh!

217
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:16,328
You have any idea what this is gonna do to our insurance premiums?

218
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,669
I don't suppose anybody brought the keys.

219
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:33,979
Oops.

220
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,515
Aah! Aah! Aah!

221
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,983
Secure the control room.

222
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,752
I'll find the hostages.

223

Unh!

00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,506
Hold these, would you?

00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,642
Sucker.

Aah!

Ha ha ha!

Is this everybody?

00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,293
Yeah.

239
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Stay with me.

240
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,695
Once we shut this place down--

241
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,941
Aah! Aah! Aah!

242
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,215
Let me out, do you hear me?!

243
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,684
I demand that I be set free immediately!

244
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,024
Oh. Hi.

245
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,226
Audrey, we need your help.

246
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,095
I can't even help myself.

247
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:04,930
Vandal's usurped my father's throne.

248
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,800
You're the queen. You have to take command of the situation.

249
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,034
How?

250
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,402
You can start by taking us

251
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,770
To the control room.

252
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:19,545
They're stalling, Vox.

253
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,479

00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,181
The nations of the world.

255
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,883
Instead of paying me tribute, they're stalling and plotting against me.

256
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:29,788
They'll have to be taught who's in charge.

257
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:30,722
It's a shame really.

258
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,691
I rather enjoyed Paris.

259
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:48,140
Hang on, buddy.

00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:01,353
Can I borrow your earrings?

265
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,155
Heck of a time to accessorize.

Breathe easy. You're gonna be ok.

00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,334
Yeah? Wish I could say the same for them.

Ooh!

270
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,787
You find the control room?

271
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:37,356
Yeah. Follow me.

272
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,961

00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,063

Unh! Aah!

00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,070
Vox: Apparently, you didn't get the message.

278
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:53,472
Let me make it loud and clear.

279
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,090
Unh!

280
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:15,360
Not another word.

They really are a girl's best friend.

You're in my way.

283
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:40,552
Can't you shut this thing off?

284
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,933
J'onn J’onzz: Batman, we couldn't prevent the railgun from discharging.

285
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,503
Me neither, but I did manage to change the targeting coordinates.

286
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,771
Where'd you send it?

287
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,772
Right here.

Hey, we can't just leave.

What's to stop somebody else

294
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,757
From taking control of that thing?

295
00:20:58,163 --> 00:20:59,397
That.

296
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:05,971
You've got a great deal of rebuilding to do.

297
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,840
I never liked the palace anyway.

00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:16,347
But maybe this is a chance for me and Kasnia to make a new start.

I don't know how you survived,

But I promise that you'll pay

306
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:46,144
For your crimes in full.

Do your worst, child.

I don't know what you're talking about.
