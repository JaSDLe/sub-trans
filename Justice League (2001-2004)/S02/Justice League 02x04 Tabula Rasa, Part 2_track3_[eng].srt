1
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:08,502
<i>Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,304
Mercy, I'm...

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,740
Sick? Dying?

4
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:15,209
And you couldn't do it somewhere else?

5
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:17,011
Now, where's professor Ivo?

6
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:19,614
When will the professor come back?

7
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:20,782
Luthor: Never.

8
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,050
You're going to take care of me now?

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:25,085
You're going to have to take care of me, too.

10
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,954
Otherwise, I'll go to sleep

11
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:28,623
And never wake up again.

12
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:31,626
Luthor: Looks like Ivo was right on the money.

13
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:33,827
His duplication program seems to be working

14
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:35,529
Rather well.

15
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:36,897
A psychic sweep.

16
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:38,532
Of the whole city.

17
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:42,369
Once the gate is opened, it might not be so easy to close.

18
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:44,438
[all talking at once]

19
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:50,111
Superman: J'onn, are you all right?

20
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,679
Leave me alone!

21
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,383
This thing can copy us...

22
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,950
Flash's speed, Wonder Woman's strength,

23
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:58,185
Even my ring.

24
00:00:58,253 --> 00:00:59,120
Aah!

25
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:00,054
You come here, and all you'll do

26
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:01,489
Is make him even stronger.

27
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,500
Unh! Arr!

28
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,275
Unh!

29
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:34,415
Unh!

30
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:04,478
Unh! Unh! Ugh!

31
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,423
Stay back. I'll take it from here.

32
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:22,496
You don't have any powers.

33
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:24,832
I have this.

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,834
[gasp]

35
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,903
[groaning]

36
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:42,016
It's a package deal.

37
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,317
You get our strengths...

38
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,720
But you also get our weaknesses.

39
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,867
You always carry kryptonite around with you?

40
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:03,003
Call it insurance.

41
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,606
And they say I'm scary.

42
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,779
[knock on door]

43
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:15,182
Well, did you finish them off this time...

44
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:19,120
Oh. Look who finally showed up.

45
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,121
Like you were really expecting me.

46
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,958
I was but not quite this soon.

47
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:26,193
People can be very predictable

48
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,562
In their wants and needs.

49
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,633
The only reason I'm here is to let you know

50
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,871
<i>That two of your friends came by.</i>

51
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:38,138
You tell them anything?

52
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,940
No, but how long can it take

53
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,808
Before they figure out you're here?

54
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:45,379
Aah!

55
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:53,988
Are you just going to stand there?

56
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:11,438
Nothing.

57
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,774
Superman: I scanned downriver.

58
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:15,776
Not even a trace.

59
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,245
And we still have to find Luthor, too.

60
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:19,880
G.L., let's follow up with Ivo.

61
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:22,049
The rest of you, keep looking for the android.

62
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:23,216
Wonder woman: What about J'onn?

63
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,751
Good question.

64
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,153
We're not sure what's going on with J’onn.

65
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:27,154
See if you can find him.

66
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,455
Of course.

67
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,827
Has anyone checked the sewers yet?

68
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:34,929
Uh, maybe g. L. And the big guy

69
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,263
Need some backup.

70
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,671
[thinking] The hatred shouldn't have surprised me,

71
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,273
But the selfishness,

72
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:47,908
The sheer volume of it,

73
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,843
The cheap attempts to disguise it.

74
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,311
What do you know?

75
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,747
A fresh rabbit every now and then,

76
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:53,781
And you're happy.

77
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,617
At least you're honest.

78
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,519
What am I fighting for?

79
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,854
Who am I fighting for?

80
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:01,889
[growls]

81
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:11,231
Jennifer!

82
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,637
Jennifer!

83
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:35,422
Slow... aah!

84
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,557
Unh!

85
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,032
Next time, I let you go first.

86
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,400
Grab whatever you can

87
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,535
And watch out for the wind.

88
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,837
What wind?

89
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:55,576
Aah!

90
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,464
I managed to pull these out.

91
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:19,533
Maybe they'll give us a lead to Luthor.

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,401
Any sign of old egghead?

93
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,870
No. There was no one in here.

94
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,539
[sigh]

95
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,553
You'll be ok here for a while.

96
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,356
It's still got the shielding you put in.

97
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:44,791
You mean you didn't sell the lead for scrap?

98
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:47,094
What would your accountant say?

99
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,533
Lex, I'm doing you a favor here.

100
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:54,335
No, you're not.

101
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,807
You're doing this because you need to.

102
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,343
I don't know what you're talking about.

103
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,245
Face it, mercy. You missed me.

104
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,814
You missed the excitement,

105
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,815
The sense of transgression,

106
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:12,920
Not to mention certain other things.

107
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,788
You're not good for me, Lex.

108
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:15,790
That much I know.

109
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:18,025
So finish your suit

110
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,860
And get out of here.

111
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:21,095
Sorry, but I'm going to be around

112
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:24,565
For a long, long time. Get used to it.

113
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,067
You've got the whole Justice League after you.

114
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,437
I've got an ally of my own now,

115
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:30,538
And soon, it's going to be

116
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,706
Just like old times around here.

117
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:35,342
Maybe better.

118
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:54,361
[gasp]

119
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,597
Lex.

120
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:59,799
You've got the wrong... dude!

121
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,323
Not again.

122
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,158
You had to buy the cheapest wiring you could find?

123
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,227
How am I supposed to get any work done?

124
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:28,795
Will you stop yelling?

125
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:29,663
You're lucky to have a place at all.

126
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,531
[crash]

127
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:42,242
It's all right. She's ok.

128
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,216
She's way more than ok.

129
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,118
Mm-mm.

130
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:52,285
What?

131
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,121
Just something he must have picked up.

132
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:57,424
Remember that ally I told you about?

133
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:59,426
This? You're kidding.

134
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:00,460
I'm serious.

135
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:02,562
Deadly serious.

136
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,864
Just ask the Justice League.

137
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:05,866
Right, my friend?

138
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:09,068
Right?

139
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,871
Why did you leave the house?

140
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:11,838
I had to look everywhere

141
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,307
Until I heard you yelling and...

142
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,642
First things first.

143
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,577
Did you finish the Justice League?

144
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,646
No.

145
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:20,247
Then what are you doing here?

146
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:21,448
Get back out there.

147
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:22,983
Why?

148
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:25,352
Because I'm telling you.

149
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,421
That's not good enough anymore.

150
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:31,758
Any sign of her?

151
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,327
Sorry. Nothing.

152
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:34,394
Nope. Not a trace.

153
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:36,330
Nothing? No tracks?

154
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,831
A piece of clothing maybe?

155
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:43,036
All right. Let's move on.

156
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,281
[thinking] I'm freezing my butt off,

157
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:56,683
And I don't even know the kid,

158
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:57,817
But I know how I'd feel

159
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:00,020
If she was my little girl.

160
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,821
[speaking] hey. Wait up!

161
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,894
Man, thinking: I'll stay up all night if I have to.

162
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:08,928
Man: I don't care what it takes.

163
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:10,530
Woman: I wish it were me instead of her.

164
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,899
Man: Only 6 years old.

165
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:30,917
Guys, over here.

166
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,524
Professor Ivo, I presume.

167
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,092
The water washed away some of the dirt

168
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,494
That was covering him.

169
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:41,995
I don't think he's going to be telling us

170
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:43,163
If Luthor's been here.

171
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,931
Come on. This whole scorched earth deal.

172
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:45,966
Of course he's been here.

173
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,768
Green Lantern: And guess who else has.

174
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,808
Batman was right.

175
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,278
Ivo, the android, Luthor...

176
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:58,279
They're connected.

177
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:59,980
Yeah. It's all making sense now,

178
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:01,148
Even to me.

179
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,282
There's more.

180
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:04,851
The reason Ivo worked out the duplication program...

181
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,022
It was so the android could evolve.

182
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,958
Evolve? Into what?

183
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,834
You don't want to help me get rid of the League,

184
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,068
That's fine.

185
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,469
I'll do it myself.

186
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:27,373
It won't be easy, one against 7.

187
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,842
I could get killed,

188
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,176
But it's better this way

189
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:31,877
For both of us.

190
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:34,280
You have your own life to live now.

191
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:36,782
I've done all I can for you.

192
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,651
Go. Be happy.

193
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:45,991
Oh! Ohh!

194
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:49,495
Go.

195
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,501
I'll do it for you.

196
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:56,201
I'll do it.

197
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:01,207
Are you out of your mind

198
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,008
Messing with him like that?

199
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,010
He could flatten you like an ant.

200
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,879
Ha ha ha!

201
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,814
Your concern is touching

202
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,850
And not entirely unexpected,

203
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,518
But professor Ivo took that

204
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,286
Into account when he built it.

205
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:16,121
This is a kill switch.

206
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,524
There's a bomb at the base of his brain,

207
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:22,228
And all I have to do is press this little button.

208
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:24,130
Does he know about that?

209
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:25,331
He doesn't need to.

210
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:26,265
He's going to do what I want

211
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,635
Out of love, not fear,

212
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,203
But unfortunately,

213
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,405
Love seldom lasts forever.

214
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:37,343
Man, thinking: We've got to find her.

215
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,344
Man: We've got to keep looking

216
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:39,945
No matter how cold it is.

217
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,013
Man: We'll find her. I know we will.

218
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,750
Woman: Please, lord, let her be all right.

219
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,351
Woman: She's got to be here somewhere.

220
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,386
Man: I'm not giving up.

221
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,721
Man: Come on, baby, where are you?

222
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:53,326
Jennifer: Mom, I'm sorry I ran away.

223
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:55,662
Please come and find me.

224
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,597
I'm so scared.

225
00:13:57,665 --> 00:13:59,565
[crying]

226
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:10,176
Don't be afraid.

227
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,448
All right, everybody.

228
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,349
Let's fan out and...

229
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:20,720
It's her!

230
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:21,887
We found her!

231
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:22,888
She's fine!

232
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:24,490
I don't believe it.

233
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,125
Look at her.

234
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:28,928
Thank you. Thank you so much.

235
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:30,463
You're great.

236
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,665
Whoever you are, thank you.

237
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,767
Such a blessing.

238
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,603
It's so wonderful.

239
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,837
How'd he do that?

240
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,105
Where did he go?

241
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,245
Wonder woman: You're not getting away that easily.

242
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,802
Batman, I found the android.

243
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:10,869
Where?

244
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,371
He's flying over downtown.

245
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,839
Keep on it. I'll tell the others.

246
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:14,940
And one more thing...

247
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:18,811
Don't go near him.

248
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,647
Batman: The android's over downtown.

249
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:21,513
We'll be right there.

250
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:23,015
You better hang back.

251
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,517
I'll be using the kryptonite again.

252
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,152
Superman: I hear you.

253
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:31,591
Got it. See you in a few minutes.

254
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:33,125
It's showtime.

255
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,275

00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:55,914

Aah!

00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:09,929
Unh! Ohh!

259
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:15,834
Batman: Some people never learn.

260
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,440
[groaning]

261
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:26,312
I guess that goes for androids, too.

262
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,882
I learn, but I also adapt

263
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,051
And evolve.

264
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,189
Aah!

265
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:50,603
Ohh!

266
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:04,516
Ohh.

267
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,118
Flash: Hey. Here I am.

268
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:09,655
No. There I am.

269
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,425
Come on, chump. Over...

270
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:16,195
Here?

271
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,598
You're just too fast for me, bro,

272
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,566
But not him.

273
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,468
Oldest trick in the boo...

274
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,958
If that thing copies your powers,

275
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,793
We'll never be able to take him down.

276
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:48,828
But I can't just...

277
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,530
You have to.

278
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:18,558
Aah!

279
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:23,595
Aah!

280
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:24,697
Ohh.

281
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:38,444
Aah!

282
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:46,452
Let's finish them.

283
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:58,464
We are not your enemy.

284
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,768
You know what to do.

285
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,772
Yes. You know.

286
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,685
Nothing can stop you now.

287
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,420
You have all their powers.

288
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,155
Use them well.

289
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:29,762
So you lied to me.

290
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,829
What?

291
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:33,099
It was all a lie, wasn't it?

292
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,901
I don't know what you're talking about.

293
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,568
Then let me spell it out for you.

294
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:40,873
I can read your mind, Lex.

295
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,840
If that's true,

296
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,609
Then you know what this is

297
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,644
And that I'm willing to use it.

298
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:04,363
Now it's my turn.

299
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,572
[groaning]

300
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,280
I say we let them waste each other.

301
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:23,449
Since when do we do what you say?

302
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,418
Wait.

303
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,366
Unh!

304
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,569
Ohh!

305
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:45,604
Oww!

No, please!

So small.

All of you.

311
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,119
And so meaningless.

Ohh!

313
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:04,723
There's nothing I want from you anymore.

314
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,561
None of you has anything to offer me now.

315
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:34,820
Where's he going?

316
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:37,055
Where gods belong.

317

Luthor: Oh, stop.

318
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,258
He's just a machine.

319

I don't care how much power he has.

320

He's no god.

321
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,732
Then why do I have a feeling

322
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,467
That if he ever comes back

323
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:50,102
You're going to be doing a lot of praying?

324
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,973
Perhaps we'll all be praying.

00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:10,956
Luthor: They're only giving me one phone call,

327
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:12,091
So listen carefully.

328
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,126
I need the best lawyers in the country.

I don't care what you have to pay for them.

330
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,429
And doctors. I need them, too.

331
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,064
Bring them in from Europe if you have to,

332
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,265
And... are you listening?
