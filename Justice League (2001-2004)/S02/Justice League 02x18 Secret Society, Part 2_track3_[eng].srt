00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,594
<i>Narrator: Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,112
Uh! Oh!

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,031
We're not working together as well as we could.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,667
What are you suggesting? - Practice.

5
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:17,452
Aw, man.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,690
You're trying to set up another Injustice gang, aren't you?

7
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:24,125
We call it a society...

8
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,394
A secret society.

9
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:30,381
No!

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,118
You've got to trust your partners.

11
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:34,736
I do, but the fact is,

12
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:36,638
I'm the invulnerable one.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,156
Are you saying we can't cut it?

14
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,992
That's what it sounds like to me.

15
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,768
Why didn't you let us finish him?

16
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:53,922
In a warehouse? That's far too small a stage.

17
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,024
I've had better luck handling whole armies.

18
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:57,425
And you know why?

19
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,777
Because I didn't have to worry about anyone but myself.

20
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:01,463
Then why don't you go back to that?

21
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,783
The least he could have done was put up some bail for us.

22
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:13,352
All Shade cares about is Shade.

23
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,953
We'd still be in the joint

24
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,621
If it hadn't been for your mom.

25
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,356
How is she gonna pay back all that money?

26
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:20,291
She'll just have to keep dancing for a few more years.

27
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:23,328
Sounds like Shade isn't too popular with you either.

28
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,279
Tell me where he is,

29
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:27,282
And I'll see that he gets what's coming to him.

30
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,883
You want Shade?

31
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,452
That's what I said.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,220
Go look under a tree.

33
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:34,222
[laughing]

34
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,107
[engine starts]

35
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,992
[tires screeching]

36
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,312
I can do this on my own.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,064
I don't need the League.

38
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,917
Fool.

39
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:48,720
Maybe, but I owe him quite a lot.

40
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,722
If it hadn't been for a certain "accident" he caused,

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,042
I never would have gotten my new mental powers.

42
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,144
That's why they broke up so easily.

43
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:57,862
You willed them to.

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,516
Even my mind isn't that powerful.

45
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,701
For months, I've been reading their body language

46
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,321
And facial expressions like a book.

47
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,639
They were holding back

48
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,741
Considerable resentment for each other.

49
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:13,127
All I had to do was get those feelings to come out.

50
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,479
How'd you do that?

51
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:16,414
Parasite, have you ever said something

52
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:17,999
You knew you shouldn't have,

53
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,767
Something really hurtful?

54
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,519
Sure.

55
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:22,854
What made you do it?

56
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:25,690
Too little sleep? Low blood sugar?

57
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,192
Maybe you were just in one of those moods

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,860
You get into every so often.

59
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,312
I hear that.

60
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,230
Precisely. This blessed organ of mine

61
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:36,668
Can send out thought waves that affect those moods.

62
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,137
They open the door that most people keep locked.

63
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:40,972
So, what's next?

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,659
We've already divided. Now we conquer.

65
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,428
Who do you think you are-- Batman?

66
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:47,930
It's been a long night.

67
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,614
Just tell me where Shade is, ok?

68
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:52,383
Look, buddy, I know Batman.

69
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,036
I once ratted out a counterfeiter to Batman.

70
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,503
And believe me,

71
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:59,174
you are no Batma-a-a-an!

72
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,609
[screaming continues]

73
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:04,613
You were saying?

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,214
All right! All right! All right!

75
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,740
Oh!

76
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:18,510
Sh-shade... He's setting up another job.

77
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:19,911
He's got this place

78
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,562
At the old North Hills subway station.

79
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:42,300
Not much of a trap.

80
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:45,003
I can go on like this all night.

81
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:48,256
My beams are as fast as you are-- light speed.

82
00:04:48,258 --> 00:04:50,292
Yeah, but you don't think that fast.

83
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:52,527
Oh! Ooh!

84
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,844
Yo, bats. Come on, pick up. I know you're there.

85
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,262
What do you want?

86
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,963
I bit off a little more

87
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:13,465
Than I can chew with Sinestro.

88
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,066
You got to give me some help here.

89
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:16,468
I thought you didn't need any.

90
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,003
Well, I do now.

91
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,039
I'm at the old North Hills subway platform. Hurry!

92
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,462
Looks like I didn't need you after all, yo.

93
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,731
But you can help me tie him up.

94
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,082
Catch.

95
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,434
Uh!

96
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:36,571
The real Flash would have been too fast for that.

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,341
Aah!

98
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,312
Aah!

99
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:46,665
What gave me away?

100
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,050
<i>You overplayed your part, yo.</i>

101
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:51,469
Grodd: Everyone's a critic.

102
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:55,991
We could have been

103
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:57,325
The greatest fighting force

104
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:58,760
In the history of the universe.

105
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:00,495
How do you walk away from that?

106
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:02,213
You were asking too much.

107
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:05,000
A little practice? That's too much to ask?

108
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,102
You wanted us to stop being individuals.

109
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,571
We're all just soldiers to you, interchangeable.

110
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:11,422
You don't care about us as people.

111
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,857
That's not true!

112
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,075
I care.

113
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:15,509
You don't care about me.

114
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,078
What are you talking about?

115
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,563
I'd give my life for you.

116
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,316
You don't know what you're saying.

117
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,723
Spy cam?

118
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:50,112
Who are you broadcasting to?

119
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,205
Hawkgirl, it's Lantern.

120
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,056
I don't have anything more to say to you.

121
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,058
Listen. Something weird is going on.

122
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,526
Meet me at the practice ring.

123
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:15,736
Well, where is he?

124
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,607
You know Batman. Always has to make an entrance.

125
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,575
Batman? Lantern was the one who called me.

126
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,677
I heard from Flash.

127
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,647
Down!

128
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:01,149
Out of the way! Everybody!

129
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,034
Hah! Ooh!

130
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:04,569
Careful!

131
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,539
I told you to get out of the way!

132
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,690
Aah!

133
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:26,991
Uh!

134
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,245
Superman.

135
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:15,507
Don't do it! It's Clayface!

136
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,271
Go!

137
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:15,750
Ha ha ha.

138
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:47,782
[crash]

139
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,379
Freeze him!

140
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,826
We did it. We got him.

141
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,561
But what about the Lantern?

142
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,713
Only a matter of time.

143
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,282
Soon we'll have the complete set.

144
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,586
Then the real fun begins.

145
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,930
Remember those old spy movies I used to act in,

146
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:55,598
where the villain would catch the hero but wouldn't kill him,

147
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,801
and then the hero would always get away?

148
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,570
I'm not much of a moviegoer.

149
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,706
My point is, we should get rid of them now.

150
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:08,778
What happened to your sense of drama, Mr. Hagen?

151
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:14,167
This is something that has to be done in front of the whole world.

152
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,203
Do your part, and I'll let you bring down the final curtain.

153
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,574
Don't underestimate us, clay.

154
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:26,096
We could have taken the League

155
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:26,096
even if Grodd hadn't been messing with their moods.

156
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:28,599
Clayface: We shouldn't overestimate ourselves either.

157
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,335
Right. What are we going to do about the Lantern?

158
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,536
I don't know. What are we going to do

159
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:35,956
About you, Mr. Stewart?

160
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,857
Can't hide from this.

161
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:44,915
Look out! Move it!

162
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,576
He's getting away!

163
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,183
Perhaps not.

164
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,224
He was mine.

165
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,060
Grodd: He's ours.

166
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,980
They all are now.

167
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:34,180
Announcer: And now,

168
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,483
For your local halftime entertainment,

169
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,503
Her last 2 albums have gone triple platinum,

170
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,905
And she's here tonight to sing her smash hit,

171
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,673
<i>Gimme gimme all your love,</i>

172
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,675
<i>From her newest album underbelly.</i>

173
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:50,680
Ladies and gentlemen, tina Squires!

[music playing]

176
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,667
Aah!

177
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:33,873
[audience murmuring]

178
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,937
Now that I have your attention...

179
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,195
We've come to this arena

180
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,699
Because it's where the strong routinely defeat the weak.

181
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:02,369
How you so-called higher primates revel in that.

182
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,738
Yet outside these walls, you do everything you can

183
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:09,075
to shackle the mighty and prevent them from fulfilling their destiny.

184
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,695
That's all about to end.

185
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,485
Just a small demonstration of our might.

186
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,339
Not convinced? There's more.

187
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:39,689
There they are... Your heroes,

188
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:41,707
Who violate every law of nature

189
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,344
By coddling the weak and cowards.

190
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,547
We say it's time for a new order.

191
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:51,801
But it can't arise until the old one departs.

192
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:54,470
Ready for your closeup, Mr. Hagen?

193
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,064
Why'd he do that?

194
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,866
Of course.

195
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:10,570
The Martian tricked us.

196
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,372
You froze the wrong one.

197
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,380
Grodd's been messing with our minds.

198
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,449
Great. How do we fight it?

199
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,284
We get over it. That's how.

200
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,954
Grodd: This isn't exactly the show I had in mind,

201
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,906
But in a way, it's going to be even better.

202
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:31,558
Don't forget your training.

203
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:38,815
Get 'em.

204
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:14,016
This time, I got the right one.

205
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,832
Never learn, do you? Uh!

206
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,469
Actually, I have learned a few things.

207
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,903
Aah!

208
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,000
Antifreeze, anyone?

209
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,753
Please, no jokes. Just get her.

210
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,886
Can't... Breathe!

211
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:41,788
[gasping]

212
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,473
Really?

213
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,874
Uh!

214
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,242
Wouldn't hit a woman, would you?

215
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,477
I would!

216
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:09,916
[audience cheering]

217
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:15,622
I knew this wouldn't work. I knew it.

218
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,009
I could have--

219
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,094
What?

220
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:23,395
Thanks.

221
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,588
[loud cheering]

222
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:55,078
That's a wrap.

223
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:57,029
Just about.

224
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:02,368
There's still a chance for us, you know.

225
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:03,670
What are you talking about?

226
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:06,055
We're the superior ones, you and I.

227
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,491
We should be running the world.

228
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,927
I don't think so.

229
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,361
Pity.

230
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,048
Aah!

231
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,737
You had your chance.

232
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:24,140
Now you can feel the pain.

233
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,076
I've... felt... worse.

234
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,711
Oh.

235
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,783
[cheering]

236
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:39,672
Whoo!

237
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,691
Back in business.

238
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,092
Aren't we?

239
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,294
A lot of things were said.

240
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:47,163
Yeah, but that was all mind control.

241
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,183
We didn't mean-- - We meant every word.

242
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,656
So, what do we do?

243
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:01,660
All we can do is say we're sorry and move on.
