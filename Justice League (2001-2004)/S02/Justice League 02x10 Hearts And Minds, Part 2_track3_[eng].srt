1
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:08,332
<i>Previously, on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,567
Kilowog: John, they got her.

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,470
They got Kat.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:15,139
Take care of him.

5
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,608
It's called the Legion of the Third Eye,

6
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:19,076
A fanatical cult from the planet Kalanor.

7
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,344
Flash: And what about this Katma Tui?

8
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,146
I'm not sure what happened to her.

9
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,148
She was the Green Lantern who trained John.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,283
They must've been close.

11
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:27,985
Despero, I presume.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,254
A new order to the universe is coming,

13
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,423
One that will be written in fire...

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,925
And with the blood of all who oppose me.

15
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,497
Aah!

16
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,132
[grunting]

17
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,901
He's preparing to start a massive war of conquest.

18
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:46,037
You'll stay here and coordinate with them.

19
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:47,372
But I--

20
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:49,807
Mmm...

21
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,809
Despero: O flame of Py’tar,

22
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:53,110
Infuse me with your power

23
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,280
So that I may carry out your will.

24
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:57,815
Go!

25
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,451
The conquest begins now!

26
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:05,490
Emblazon my word and will across the cosmos!

27
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:19,463
Despero's created one of the most formidable forces I've ever seen.

28
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,064
He's out to control the galaxy,

29
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,400
And I think he can do it.

30
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,134
The galaxy is a big place, Kat.

31
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:26,137
Despero doesn't have the manpower.

32
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,972
He'd spread his forces way too thin.

33
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,041
Not if he pulls in new recruits from each world he conquers.

34
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,577
Katma's right.

35
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:36,246
Despero can subjugate a people using only his mind.

36
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:39,416
His army will grow with each world he conquers.

37
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:40,818
All right, then. Enough talk.

38
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,419
Let's mobilize the corp.

39
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,254
I doubt these amateurs can hold their own

40
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,323
Against a few thousand Green Lanterns.

41
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,959
Despero's got some kind of dampening field around this planet.

42
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:51,195
Communications with Oa are impossible.

43
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:52,830
Then sit tight.

44
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,599
I'll be back with the cavalry.

45
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:01,439
We are betrayed!

46
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:02,673
And you led them here!

47
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,142
Sorry, honey, I'm too good for that.

48
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,512
[grunting]

49
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,984
What the--

50
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,087
Stewart, what are you doing?

51
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,589
My ring. I can't get it to work.

52
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:27,898
There's too many of them.

53
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,544
Regroup at the secondary site. Hurry!

54
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,647
Ok, everybody out.

55
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,212
The other way!

56
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:23,754
Trapped!

57
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,122
Then we'll make our last stand here.

58
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,957
Hyaa!

59
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,371
Hey, G.L., did you miss me?

60
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,039
Like a toothache.

61
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:44,208
[grunting]

62
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,345
John, Katma. Are you guys ok?

63
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,050
Ah, you must be the mystery woman.

64
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,585
And you must be?

65
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,254
Delighted to meet you.

66
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,561
That's a bit old-fashioned.

67
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,064
I'll explain later.

68
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,299
We gotta move before reinforcements arrive.

69
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,578
There seems to be a recurring theme here.

70
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:22,079
You can read these?

71
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,347
You mean you can't?

72
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:25,082
These chambers are ancient.

73
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,051
No one knows who built them.

74
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,453
These icons suggest that your world

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,255
May have had a flourishing ecosystem at one time

76
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:35,692
Much different from the barren desert conditions of today.

77
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,730
Legend does say that Kalanor was once a paradise.

78
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,733
This same tree seems to repeat throughout.

79
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,402
Apparently, it holds some significance.

80
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,672
The only image I recognize is the flame of Py’tar.

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,310
That tells me that this evil has been on Kalanor for centuries.

82
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:55,045
Radocko: Ancient drawings by cavemen, that's all they are.

83
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,548
Are we just going to sit here and talk or do something?

84
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,783
Patience, Radocko.

85
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:02,119
We might as well accept that the cause is lost.

86
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,457
Forgive him. He is young.

87
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:09,626
But I must admit... It does look hopeless.

88
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:12,730
Only if you believe it to be is it so.

89
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,599
Katma: Try again.

90
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:20,804
I don't get it. Is the ring...broken?

91
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:24,008
Power rings don't break. But something else did.

92
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:26,310
You mean me? That's nuts.

93
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:30,147
The broken wills of over a million Kalanorn speaks to the contrary.

94
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,250
So Despero somehow got to me.

95
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,152
He did something inside my head.

96
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:36,287
That would explain this feeling,

97
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,322
Like a piece of me is missing.

98
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:39,824
An important piece.

99
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,658
But if that's gone...

100
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,027
Then we start over.

101
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,996
I trained you once. I can do it again.

102
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:48,165
Back to basics? I don't think so.

103
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,668
The problem with half the Corp, you included,

104
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,903
...is that once you learn to use your rings like jackhammers,

105
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,171
you forget the subtleties

106
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,007
Of manipulation and control.

107
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,976
I know. I know. The mind is the weapon, not the metal.

108
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:01,045
At least you remember that much.

109
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:03,181
It's time to relearn what you've learned.

110
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,016
Now you sound like Yoda.

111
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,518
Look, you have two choices:

112
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:10,187
Let me help you retune your mental disciplines,

113
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,858
Or you can live with your emerald impudence.

114
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,059
Impotence?

115
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:20,163
Uh...Right. I-- I was just going over there.

116
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,200
Ok. You win.

117
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:26,337
Guess it really will be like old times.

118
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:30,007
Don't presume too much, John Stewart.

119
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:38,148
Krizblack, do you have news from the Ministry of Conversion?

120
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:41,052
Lieutenant Franzee has a report, lord.

121
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,486
Step forward, my son.

122
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:45,723
Our forces stormed the enemy headquarters.

123
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,725
Unfortunately, the nonbelievers escaped.

124
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:49,660
I failed you.

125
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,295
I see.

126
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:54,431
And naturally, you've come to beg for forgiveness.

127
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,134
I know I'm unworthy.

128
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,736
This is true.

129
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:01,405
What must I do to atone?

130
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:06,076
March into the desert dressed in simple robes and without provisions.

131
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:08,578
Stay there and await a vision from me.

132
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:10,414
Only then will you be cleansed

133
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:12,917
And ready to reenter my kingdom.

134
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:14,751
Thank you, lord Despero.

135
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,988
I praise your name. Thank you!

136
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,257
Despero is the beginning.

137
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:23,127
Despero is the end. Despero is all.

138
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:28,933
Tell lieutenant Franzee's forces that he won't be back.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,367
Then send them out again.

140
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:34,771
These nonbelievers must be brought around to my truth.

141
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,542
Yes, lord. But if I may be so bold,

142
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,444
Your power is great and theirs is small.

143
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,113
Surely they pose no threat.

144
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,116
A lone voice in the darkness

145
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:47,784
Can rouse many if not snuffed out.

146
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:52,022
My word is absolute and must be accepted by all.

147
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,324
Of course, lord.

148
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:02,899
Remember, surface thought is only the initiator.

149
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,602
The inner governing thought

150
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,704
Maintains the integrity through power of will.

151
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,041
This is key when multitasking,

152
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:11,908
Especially if you're in space.

153
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,580
[grunting]

154
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:21,285
Aah! Oof!

155
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,086
If that was your life support field,

156
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,788
We'd be picking you up with a vacuum now.

157
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,323
Let's take it from the top.

158
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,292
This is useless.

159
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,826
Where do you think you're going?

160
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:30,861
I need some air.

161
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,095
I didn't say you could go.

162
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:33,531
Excuse me?

163
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:36,100
You're as bad as that Rayner kid you sent me to train.

164
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,067
What's your problem?

165
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,036
I think the problem is yours.

166
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:41,104
I'm not a kid anymore!

167
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:47,877
She's got a bit of an edge to her.

168
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:49,346
You're kidding, right?

169
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:50,815
Just an observation.

170
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,383
It's like she thinks I'm still a raw recruit.

171
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:55,519
We tend to cling to images of people

172
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,020
From when we knew them best,

173
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:59,055
Forgetting that they do change.

174
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:04,027
Ok. So as someone who knows John Stewart in the here and now,

175
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,196
How would you handle me?

176
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,930
As a friend and equal,

177
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,832
I'd say get back in there and try again

178
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,868
Or I'll knock you into next Tuesday.

179
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:14,104
Somehow I fail to see the difference in your approach.

180
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,973
Oh, there's a difference.

181
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,876
You just haven't figured it out yet.

182
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,678
Now get back in there.

183
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,546
Ooh!

184
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:24,982
Despero must have a weakness.

185
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:28,051
We need to discover what it is and exploit it.

186
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:30,855
[chomping]

187
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,322
Got any more of that?

188
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,828
Not exactly Bob and Terry's.

189
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,396
No kidding.

190
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,131
But with a hypercharged metabolism,

191
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:42,666
I can't always be choosy.

192
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,234
Especially if we're going into action.

193
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,737
Kilowog, your rings and Lantern batteries

194
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:49,640
Are all fed from a much larger power source, correct?

195
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,376
That's right. The central power battery on Oa.

196
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,178
Its energy is almost infinite.

197
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,581
Despero is channeling a great deal of power himself.

198
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:59,683
It stands to reason that he may have

199
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:02,453
A similar energy supply and distribution system.

200
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,555
How about that flame of his?

201
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,989
My thoughts exactly.

202
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:09,560
Somehow Despero draws power from it.

203
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,828
Then he channels it through his third eye.

204
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,797
So if we take out the flame--

205
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:16,633
The Pytar's comprised of pure nuclear plasma.

206
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,468
You can't just blow it out like a candle.

207
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,570
You can with a carbon bomb.

208
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,805
A what?

209
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,073
Of course.

210
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,908
Carbon can be used to arrest nuclear activity.

211
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,077
And I can build one in a few hours.

212
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,079
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kilowog,

213
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,714
The man of a thousand talents.

214
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,367
Oh!

215
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,012
Aah!

216
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,721
Soon, great Py’tar,

217
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,890
We will receive word from our forces

218
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,624
On our latest conquest.

219
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,361
[clears throat]

220
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:20,096
Some better news this time, I trust.

221
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,965
Indeed, lord.

222
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,140
Speak.

223
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,576
Lord Despero, the unbelievers and off worlders

224
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:35,645
Have regrouped in the city's ancient catacombs.

225
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,247
I can show you where to find them.

226
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:39,649
And why should I take your word?

227
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,952
What do you gain from this betrayal?

228
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,588
I only wish to be part of the winning side.

229
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:46,590
Ha ha ha!

230
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,258
Well, young one,

231
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:51,462
You've assured yourself a position there indeed.

232
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,129
Prepare your forces.

233
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:56,533
I will show this resistance the error of their ways.

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,169
They will accept the light of Py’tar,

235
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:09,412
Or they will die.

236
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,483
I'm afraid he's finished.

237
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:14,884
When this mission's over,

238
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,052
We'll have to recall Rayner

239
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
To take over John's sector.

240
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,988
Just like that?

241
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,323
He's given up on himself.

242
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:22,526
He's not the only one.

243
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,094
But I guess that's what happens

244
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,364
When a toy loses its luster.

245
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,666
Are you going to need all those power cells?

246
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,268
If that's what it takes.

247
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:33,537
I can still pull my weight, you know.

248
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,739
There's more to me than just a fancy ring.

249
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,541
I've always known that, John.

250
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:52,121
There's an exhaust port that few know about.

251
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,890
It will take us into the throne room.

252
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,158
Excellent.

253
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,428
You sure this thing'll work?

254
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:00,830
Thermal mechanics was always my best subject.

255
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,700
We have every confidence in your abilities, Kilowog.

256
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,268
[blast]

257
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,739
Aah!

258
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:15,178
Don't just stand there! Light 'em up!

259
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,918
Aah! Oof!

260
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:24,921
Aah!

261
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,428
Hey, what's Katma doing?

262
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,031
Buying us time. We must go.

263
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,199
Say what?

264
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,501
We have the carbon bomb.

265
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:39,503
If we are captured, all hope is lost.

266
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,837
J'onn's right, little poozer.

267
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:42,405
We got a job to do.

268
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:57,086
[grunting]

269
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:58,755
Hawkgirl: J'onn, are you ok?

270
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:01,625
I'll let you know when my head stops throbbing.

271
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,592
Katma?

272
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,328
She's still out cold.

273
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:08,398
I admit I am puzzled as to how you survived the Py’tar,

274
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:09,833
But it's just as well.

275
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,701
Killing you is a waste

276
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:13,703
When I can make better use of your talents

277
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,271
In my army.

278
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,675
We're not interested.

279
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:21,111
It's not like you have a choice.

280
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,880
I've just launched a second invasion wave.

281
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,949
Soon, I will launch another.

282
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,818
You three will be part of it.

283
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,522
Prepare to embrace the power of the Py’tar.

284
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,524
[grunting]

285
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,426
Aah!

286
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,733
This would seem to be it.

287
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,301
Allow me.

288
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,946
Now, who's next?

289
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:59,215
Unh...

290
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:00,150
Keep away from her!

291
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:02,451
The wings give her an exotic quality,

292
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,687
Wouldn't you agree?

293
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,855
I don't think I'll put her in the army.

294
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,392
I have just the place for her

295
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,860
As one of my personal attendants.

296
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,396
Don't even think about it.

297
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:21,738
Aah!

298
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,352
Aah!

299
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,160
Yeah!

300
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,495
[grunting]

301
00:16:58,342 --> 00:16:59,876
Round two, freak.

302
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,167
Ooh...Oh...

303
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:26,503
[beeping]

304
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,072
Fire in the hole!

305
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,741
Wait! Stop!

306
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,313
Unh!

307
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,918
[straining]

308
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:53,797
Aah!

309
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,434
What are we waiting for?

310
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,736
The Py’tar. It's a sentient being.

311
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:00,971
A what?

312
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,339
It's alive. In pain.

313
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:06,409
It wants to make contact.

314
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:09,145
Unh!

315
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,114
Unh!

316
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:20,857
Not this time.

317
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,596
Unh!

318
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:30,867
Unh!

319
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,645
I can almost connect with it.

320
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,850
[screaming]

321
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,419
J'onn!

322
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,144
Ok. We are officially spooked here.

323
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:18,081
Hear me, o children of Kalanor.

324
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:24,153
Behold, I am the Py’tar, the living soul of this planet.

325
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,623
Despero is a great deceiver.

326
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:30,494
He has misused my power for his own petty ends.

327
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:35,832
I say unto thee the Py’tar is not a source of hatred,

328
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,267
But a beacon of hope.

329
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:42,005
In times gone by, Kalanor was a paradise.

330
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:43,406
It can be again.

331
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:47,344
But thou must reject the dark ways of Despero

332
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:50,012
And step into the light.

333
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,081
The choice is thine.

334
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,111
[groaning]

335
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:25,315
Py’tar, do not forsake me.

336
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:29,119
Oh!

337
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:38,195
Oh, Py’tar.

338
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,197
Now I see...

339
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:42,899
Paradise.

340
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,848
It's a miracle.

341
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,484
It's just the normal life force of your planet

342
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,554
Reasserting itself after centuries of entrapment.

343
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:40,556
And you won't have to worry

344
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:42,892
About Despero anymore.

345
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,493
Where is old 3 eyes?

346
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:47,596
He finally saw the light.

347
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,134
Well, ok, then. We've saved the day.

348
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:52,568
Can we go home now?

349
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:56,139
There's still a lot that needs to be done to rebuild Kalanor.

350
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:58,208
We could use your help.

351
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,012
Sorry, Kat. Duty calls.

352
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:14,824
Good-bye, Shifflet. Good luck to you all.

353
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:16,093
Hey, Kilowog!

354
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:18,061
Bratwurst, my place, next week.

355
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:19,495
You're on, poozer.

356
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:20,630
What's a bratwurst?

357
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,401
Phew!

358
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,173
That Katma’s quite a woman.

359
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,275
Yeah. A good teacher, too.

360
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:35,011
But some things can't be taught.

361
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,447
Some things you only get through experience.

362
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:38,281
Like?

363
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:40,216
Clarity.
