1
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,234
<i>Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,069
We meet again, Kal-El.

3
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:11,804
What do you want?

4
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:14,340
Even as we speak, Apokolips is being assimilated

5
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:17,009
By the kryptonian menace known as Brainiac.

6
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,410
Once he's finished siphoning

7
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:22,347
The memory banks and technology of my planet...

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,716
He'll annihilate it.

9
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:25,985
Good.

10
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:29,588
We know he used you, humiliated you. Get over it!

11
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,824
All right. But I need you to do something for me.

12
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:33,992
Who are you?

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,293
They call me Forager.

14
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,796
Do you know someone named Orion?

15
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,666
Orion is a god who is far above us.

16
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,767
Hold still. We won't hurt you.

17
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,438
No, you most certainly will not.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,874
Man: Superman has played his part.

19
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:50,376
Now it's our turn.

20
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,880
You imbeciles are letting Brainiac get away.

21
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:56,848
Oh, my stars.

22
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,418
What is that thing?

23
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:01,186
J'onn: We'll know soon enough.

24
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:17,262
No response.

25
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,064
The controls have been overridden.

26
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,566
So what do we do now?

27
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,401
What can we do, but wait?

28
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,633
[loud hum]

29
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,070
Welcome, Kal-El.

30
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,842
Once I offered you the chance to join me

31
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,278
In carrying on the legacy of Krypton.

32
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,147
Today I renew that offer.

33
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:43,249
You must be joking.

34
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:46,619
Why do you reject your great heritage?

35
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,954
The entire history of your planet,

36
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,989
Its knowledge and splendor,

37
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:53,058
Its awe and mystery

38
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,761
Are encoded within me.

39
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,867
Superman, don't...

40
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,770
I am Krypton.

41
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:06,738
You're a perversion,

42
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,874
Dishonoring the very memory of my father

43
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,010
And all my people.

44
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,612
And this is your final decision?

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,914
Read my lips. Go to...

46
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,583
Unfortunate...

47
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,217
But predictable.

48
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,427
Move!

49
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,767
Hyah! Hyah!

50
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,337
Hyah!

51
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:45,844
Uh!

52
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:54,019
Aah!

53
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:58,056
[yelling]

54
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:05,764
Hyah! Hyah!

55
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,832
Hyah!

56
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,275
Someone had to do it.

57
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,277
No problem.

58
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,511
Then it's over.

59
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,580
Brainiac: Again you've miscalculated.

60
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,150
It hasn't even begun.

61
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,495
Man: It's hard, isn't it?

62
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:39,832
But we must lovingly tend our garden

63
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,067
If we want it to grow strong and tall.

64
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,368
I hate this.

65
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:44,736
What's wrong, child?

66
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,172
I've tried, Highfather.

67
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,675
Really I have. But look.

68
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,243
Patience, my dear.

69
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,245
Everything has a purpose

70
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,781
And a place.

71
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:56,849
Everything?

72
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,919
Given time.

73
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,293
Man: Highfather.

74
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,332
I have urgent news from Apokolips.

75
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,934
Indeed.

76
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,269
We're friends of Superman.

77
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:20,539
He sent us to warn you that Darkseid is under attack on Apokolips.

78
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:22,874
Do not speak that name in front of the children.

79
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:24,309
You'll frighten them.

80
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:25,577
They should be afraid.

81
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,747
For too long, the shadow of Apokolips

82
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,348
Has threatened New Genesis.

83
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,384
Come with me.

84
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:35,187
Would you excuse us, children?

85
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:47,032
Orion: Well, let me mount an army.

86
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,667
While Darkseid is under siege,

87
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,336
We will attack and end

88
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:52,905
His reign of terror once and for all.

89
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:54,340
Superman asked for your help.

90
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,108
He doesn't want to start a war.

91
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,609
Don't be so sure.

92
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,144
Highfather: You forget.

93
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,713
In the name of peace,

94
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,148
We swore not to interfere on Apokolips.

95
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,616
We made a pact.

96
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,852
As long as Darkseid is in power,

97
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,954
There can be no real peace.

98
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:11,023
There is truth in what you say.

99
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,691
Then give the order.

100
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,959
No!

101
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:16,028
Though I love you like a son,

102
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,930
You are too young to remember

103
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:19,899
The endless bloodshed we endured.

104
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,735
Before making such a terrible decision,

105
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,637
I must commune with the source.

106
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,039
You will await my verdict.

107
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,242
Yes, Highfather.

108
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,150
[growls]

109
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:46,525
[yells]

110
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,128
Hyah!

111
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,809
[growling]

112
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,896
Darkseid.

113
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,399
Aah!

114
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,733
[screaming]

115
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:33,873
It appears our stratagem was a success.

116
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:38,077
Yes.

117
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,879
As promised,

118
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:43,182
I've delivered Superman into your hands.

119
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,159
Those people we met

120
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:55,094
Down below... who are they?

121
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,295
They're not important,

122
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:59,365
Just bugs.

123
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:01,534
And where are you going?

124
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,402
To face Darkseid.

125
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,171
But Highfather ordered you to wait.

126
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,940
Why are you so eager to fight?

127
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,675
I have my reasons. Now stand aside.

128
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:10,876
We can't let you go.

129
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:12,277
Try to stop me.

130
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,345
[beeps]

131
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,521
Next time I let Superman take charge,

132
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,057
Just hit me real hard.

133
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:32,131
Remember the terms of our bargain.

134
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,099
In exchange for Superman,

135
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,334
You promised to spare my planet.

136
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:37,670
Agreed.

137
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:51,517
But I still can't fathom why you need him.

138
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,718
Surely not for simple revenge.

139
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,521
It is quite elementary.

140
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:56,755
Observe.

141
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,630
Over the years,

142
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:06,932
I have roamed the universe, collecting data.

143
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,034
As my appetite grew,

144
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:13,472
I changed and evolved into what you see today.

145
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:20,045
From this central core,

146
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:22,214
I can send countless drones

147
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,382
To the farthest corners of the galaxy

148
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,585
To gather more data for my collection,

149
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:29,220
But it is not enough.

150
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:32,724
I have reached the limits of my programmed functions.

151
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,726
To evolve to the next level,

152
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:36,961
I must extract living D.N.A.

153
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,631
From the last kryptonian.

154
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:44,936
[screaming]

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,708
Now I become a true life form...

156
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,678
The likes of which this universe has never seen.

157
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,453
Brainiac: Wait.

158
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:02,721
What have you done?

159
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:04,923
Darkseid: Just a minor modification

160
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,592
To override your control circuits.

161
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:10,495
You are now the instrument of my will.

162
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,906
[screaming]

163
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,710
Brainiac: You deceived me, Darkseid, used me.

164
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:26,678
It's what I do.

165
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:42,494
J'onn, wake up.

166
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:47,466
What hit us?

167
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,800
It was Darkseid.

168
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,636
Then Superman was right.

169
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:53,305
This was all an elaborate trap.

170
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,240
Where is Superman?

171
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,411
I can't locate him.

172
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,313
He's either unconscious or...

173
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:13,525
All these worlds that Brainiac has visited.

174
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:16,428
Somewhere in here there might be information about Thanagar.

175
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,598
There's no time to think about that.

176
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,233
Superman needs us.

177
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,537
Why are you doing this?

178
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:28,907
Before Brainiac had the power to devour planets.

179
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:32,243
Now he can consume an entire universe.

180
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:34,346
[screaming]

181
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:54,499
He is my solution to the ultimate problem...

182
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,735
The anti-life equation.

183
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,477
This isn't Apokolips.

184
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:09,714
No. But Mother Box senses Darkseid's hand here.

185
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:16,455
But why?

186
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,024
You, of all people, should know,

187
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,692
The universe is filled

188
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,927
With chaos, confusion, and uncertainty.

189
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,663
I will tear it down to nothing

190
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:27,199
And then rebuild it,

191
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,968
Bringing order and discipline at last.

192
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,104
Think of it, Superman...

193
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,740
<i>A new universe created in my image.</i>

194
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,752
[rumbling]

195
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,853
What?

196
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:53,958
By the source.

197
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,945
Highfather, what is it?!

198
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:18,549
Darkseid.

199
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,153
Get everyone to the escape pods.

200
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,154
What?

201
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:24,622
We have no choice.

202
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,557
Evacuate the city.

203
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,766
Darkseid, I calculate that this reaction

204
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,401
Will soon reach critical mass.

205
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,169
If you don't release me,

206
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:40,005
There will be no stopping it.

207
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,239
Precisely.

208
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:44,442
Hawkgirl: Then I guess it's up to us.

209
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:51,516
Aah!

210
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,292
Brainiac, stop them!

211
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,462
I have no desire to save you,

212
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,231
But I am compelled to obey.

213
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,043
J'onn: Get back!

214
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:20,145
No way!

215
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:25,317
Hyah! Hyah!

216
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,653
Aah!

217
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,754
No!

218
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:32,991
Uh! Ungh!

219
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,534
Finish them now.

220
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:48,907
What?!

221
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,679
Hello, father.

222
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,448
Don't I get a hug?

223
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,401
Having fun?

224
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:17,903
Yes.

225
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:23,008
Come on!

226
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,016
Cover me.

227
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,319
Ungh! My pleasure.

228
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:35,921
[wind]

229
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,905

[groaning]

233
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,002
Brainiac: Warning... circuit incomplete.

234
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,038
Critical system failure.

235
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:26,972
Hyah!

236
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,541
Where's Darkseid?

237
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,943
I don't know. But we've got to get out of here.

238
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,861
I'm glad to see growing up with Highfather

239
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,996
Has made you soft and weak.

240
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:58,103
You make an old man proud.

241
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:02,073
But I won't let you or anyone else

242
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,408
Stand in my way.

243
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:10,515
Spare the rod.

244
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:15,854
Superman: Any minute now, Brainiac will explode.

245
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:19,224
And guess what. You're going with him.

246
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,228
No, Darkseid.

247
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,499
To get off this rock, you'll have to go through me.

248
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,201
You really are a glutton for punishment.

249
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,336
Time and again, I've beaten you,

250
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,437
Humbled you.

251
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,440
What makes you think today's outcome

252
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:36,908
Will be any different?

253
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:38,376
Because this time,

254
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:43,348
I won't stop until you're just a greasy smear on my fist.

255
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,083
Let's go.

256
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,541
It seems you need

257
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,678
Another lesson in humility, boy.

258
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:21,853
Wonder woman: Wait!

259
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,955
Where's Superman?

260
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:25,523
That idiot. I'll get him.

261
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:27,992
The rest of you, take off now!

262
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,993
But...

263
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,195
Just do it!

264
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:32,263
I hope he knows what he's doing.

265
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:45,077
This is where you belong, Superman:

266
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:47,946
Under my heel.

267
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,183
Uh! Uh!

268
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:54,318
Uh!

269
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,787
Superman!

270
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,457
Go! I'm finishing this!

271
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,159
Kent, don't be a fool.

272
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:39,397
Get out of here now!

Loser.

277
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,769
Nothing could have survived that,

278
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:21,306
Not even Darkseid.

279
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,177
You know something, Bruce?

280
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,011
You're not always right.

281
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,022

Any sign of the others?

284
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:55,106
I've searched everywhere.

285
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:56,974
There's nothing.

286
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,811
Then all is lost.

287
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,514
[children giggling]

288
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:04,749
Listen.

289
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:07,252
I'll race you!

290
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,388
Highfather, Highfather!

291
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,057
It's a miracle.

292
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,372
How did you survive?

293
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,575
He found us and hid us in his hive

294
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:33,211
Until the storm blew over.

<i>You did this?</i>

296
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:40,084
Forgive my presumption, Highfather.

297
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:44,289
No. Forgive me...

298
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,958
For forgetting that everything has a purpose...

299
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:48,826
And a place.

300
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,496
Today, here at our side,

301
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:54,065
You have found your place.

302
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:59,237
Perhaps someday, you will find yours, as well.

303
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,073
Some day.
