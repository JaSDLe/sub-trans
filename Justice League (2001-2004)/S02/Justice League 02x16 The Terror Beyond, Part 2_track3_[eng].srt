2
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:12,755
If you help Grundy, Grundy will help you.

3
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,857
The curse removed your soul.

4
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:17,126
Grundy wants it back.

5
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,228
Will magician help?

6
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:22,498
I will do everything I can.

7
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,651
The walls between the worlds have been torn asunder.

8
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,271
I order them now sealed.

9
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:32,208
Banish the Old Ones and seal the breach.

10
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,643
Stop!

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,944
You take the magician.

12
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:37,530
Your mace seems to be giving him fits.

13
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:38,931
[gasp]

14
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:47,706
Those runes-- they're thanagarian.

15
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:49,007
Hah!

16
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:51,427
What do you know about Thanagar? Talk!

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,630
You've run out of choices.

18
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:57,650
Tell us what you're doing-- now.

19
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:03,206
<i>We were trying to prevent that.</i>

20
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:15,962
Worm face tries to attack Grundy’s friends.

21
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:18,498
Grundy crush!

22
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,300
Stay back, all of you.

23
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,485
Everything's in the hands of Fate now.

28

How could you possibly know that incantation?

29
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:13,259
Where I come from,

30
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,404
it's the closest thing we have to a prayer.

31
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,873
Is it over?

32
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,558
No. Only a beginning.

33
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:22,077
It will rest, then attack again.

34
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,997
We must complete the original spell.

35
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,217
You don't have the strength.

36
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:28,918
Nor do I have a choice.

37
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:30,986
What is going on here?

38
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,154
<i>What was that thing?</i>

39
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:33,389
There's no time.

40
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,124
Make time... Or are you scared

41
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,159
Because there's no water in here?

42
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:38,962
We're not gonna fight again, are we?

43
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,864
No, we aren't.

44
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,799
I'll show you what you wish to know.

45
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:50,889
Pretty.

46
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,124
Where is that?

47
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,244
It's Atlantis thousands of years

48
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:56,896
Before it sank beneath the waves.

49
00:03:56,963 --> 00:04:00,866
In those days, Atlantis was ruled by sorcerer kings.

50
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:03,453
And fortunately so, for Atlantis,

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,771
Along with most of the ancient world,

52
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:11,827
Found itself under attack by extradimensional beings called "the Old Ones."

53
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,980
[roar]

54
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:24,307
The Old Ones nearly destroyed humanity

55
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,375
As they prepared the way

56
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,377
For the most powerful of their number--

57
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,580
Great Itchtultu .

58
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:35,301
But king Poseidon gambled that they could be stopped.

59
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:39,772
He gathered nearly all of the ambient mystical energy on earth,

60
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,659
Then forged it into a single weapon.

61
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,461
The power of the trident

62
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:49,431
Served to banish the Old Ones from our realm.

63
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,964
But the price was high.

64
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,834
Poseidon knew that the same mystic energy

65
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,469
He used to defeat the Old Ones

66
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:13,339
Also powered the spells that prevented Atlantis

67
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:16,843
From sinking beneath the ocean.

68
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,678
He saved the world,

69
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:21,180
But doomed Atlantis to rest forever

70
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:23,383
At the bottom of the sea.

71
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,686
Now the Old Ones seek to return to our world.

72
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:29,188
Already, fissures have appeared,

73
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:30,873
Allowing creatures from their world

74
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,792
To gain entrance into ours.

75
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,527
When you interrupted,

76
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,597
We were helping Fate cast a spell to bar their way.

77
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:40,415
And now we must complete the ceremony.

78
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:43,052
I won't let you torture Grundy again.

79
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,337
It's not exactly torture, Diana.

80
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,639
More like... Sacrifice.

81
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,692
How do you know so much about this?

82
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,894
My people once worshipped Itchtultu .

83
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:54,147
On Thanagar?

84
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:55,565
The Old Ones are an evil not bound

85
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:57,683
By your understanding of geography.

86
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:59,318
In return for his favors,

87
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,270
My ancestors made offerings to him.

88
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:03,206
I can't believe anyone would cooperate

89
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:04,474
With that... thing.

90
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,742
It was thousands of years ago.

91
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,744
We were still a primitive culture.

92
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:09,745
With your knowledge,

93
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,613
Perhaps you can help with the ceremony.

94
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:12,965
Forget the ceremony.

95
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:15,701
We're not sacrificing Grundy or anybody else.

96
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,236
Grundy volunteered.

97
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,938
I'm not sure he's competent to volunteer.

98
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,891
Does he even understand what you're asking of him?

99
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,592
Grundy understands.

100
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,380
Grundy helps magician, then magician will help Grundy.

101
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:28,764
I agree with Superman.

102
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:30,132
There has to be another way.

103
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,450
There is.

104
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,802
We go to Itchtultu 's world and kick his slimy--

105
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,639
Bird nose is right. Fight, not hide.

106
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,725
No. We should stick to our original plan.

107
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,326
This may be better.

108
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:44,913
It's more likely to work than simply recasting a broken spell.

109
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:46,082
It's a fool's errand.

110
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,384
I joined with you to protect Atlantis.

111
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:50,536
And the rest of the world be hanged?

112
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,020
We need your power.

113
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,389
So do my people.

114
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,357
My place is with them.

115
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:56,725
Aquaman--

116
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,910
I have spoken.

117
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:00,429
Very well.

118
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,516
A spell to return you to your home.

119
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,586
Inza, I must ask you--

120
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,789
To remain here as your anchor

121
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:12,241
So you can find your way back.

122
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:13,810
Prepare yourselves.

123
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,589
I always thought it was a fable to scare children.

124
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,040
I'll take point.

125
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,876
No! Keep down!

126
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,281
What did you do that for?

127
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:37,282
In this realm,

128
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,819
Ground and sky are not always parallel.

129
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:40,953
If we are separated,

130
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,005
You could become hopelessly lost.

131
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,219
I'm glad to see you safe.

132
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,789
And I you, my love.

133
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:01,791
Assemble my war council.

134
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,793
Atlantis is in grave danger.

135
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,728
Attack from the surface world?

136
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:07,296
Not this time.

137
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:10,132
But our enemies must be very near indeed.

138
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:11,650
You've heard reports from our sentries.

139
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:12,785
No.

140
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:14,587
It's the creatures of the sea.

141
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:17,139
Mera, I can't hear their thoughts.

142
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,424
They're gone.

143
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,715
Superman: I still don't see

144
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:27,816
How your people could have fallen

145
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,219
Under the sway of a creature like Itchtultu .

146
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,738
Hawkgirl: Thanagar was a harsh world in those days.

147
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,974
Itchtultu gave us agriculture,

148
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,043
Mathematics, philosophy.

149
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,245
The foundations of our entire culture.

150
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,663
But something changed?

151
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,264
You stopped believing in him.

152
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:43,432
Yes.

153
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,167
Modern thanagarians bow down

154
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,836
To no higher power.

155
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:50,139
I sense that we are very near our goal.

156
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:57,279
[scream]

157

[screaming]

158
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:25,791
Grundy hates stupid screaming man.

159
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,797
Grundy knows how he can crush

160
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:51,700
Lots of screaming men.

161
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:01,610
Aargh!

162
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,971
Bird nose helps Grundy?

163
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:15,341
But bird nose and her friends hate Grundy.

164
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:16,308
Grundy help bird nose,

165
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,527
Bird nose help Grundy, ok?

166
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:23,866
Excuse me. Hawkgirl smash.

167
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,335
[scream]

168
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,013
Superman: Everybody ok?

169
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,631
Grundy: Ok. Hawkgirl: Fine.

170
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,200
Magician: I am unharmed.

171
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:42,701
Let's get on with this.

172
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:58,267
For Atlantis!

173
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,586
Hawkgirl: Let me ask you something.

174
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:19,188
Do you really gain strength

175
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,706
When you call on your gods?

176
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:21,957
Of course I do.

177
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,576
My beliefs sustain me.

178
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:26,395
That must be comforting.

179
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:28,864
There are times when faith is all we have to rely upon.

180
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:30,049
I don't know how you can

181
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:32,518
Bear the weight all alone.

182
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:33,969
Great Hera.

183
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,394
<i>What is that?</i>

184
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:45,097
The breach between this dimension and our own.

185
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:46,766
My spell weakens.

186
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,933
It is only a matter of time

187
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,019
Until it fails altogether.

188
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,286
Then we stop them here.

189
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:52,287
Not all of us.

190
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,673
You and Wonder Woman halt their advance.

191
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:58,343
The rest of us will take the battle to Itchtultu .

192
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,782
Stay on the path.

193
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,345
Magician, why we stop?

194
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:53,415
He's here. I feel him.

195
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,234
Where?

196
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,436
I'm not sure.

197
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,921
Everywhere.

198
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,075
Be on your guard.

199
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:24,345
Itchtultu: Speak not until spoken to, dust mote.

200
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,064
Ok, that was just rude.

201
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,199
Wind mote, who are you?

202
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,152
Shayera Hol. Hawkgirl.

203
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:34,022
You have the stench of the thanagarians upon you.

204
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,190
Says the giant squid.

205
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,025
Definitely thanagarian.

206
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:39,694
I will speak to the Hawkgirl

207
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:41,529
Before I destroy her.

208
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,948
You others hold no interest.

209
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,435
[groan]

210
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,972
Grundy crush pimple man.

211
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,671
Hang on, Grundy, I've got him.

212
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:14,545
Get back, bird nose.

213
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,267
Let me put that out for you.

214
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,069
[whoosh]

215
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,790
Speak to me, child of Thanagar.

216
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,342
Nothing to say

217
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,461
I've got a gesture for you, but my hands are tied.

218
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,847
How I've missed your people's spirit.

219
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:51,282
We don't miss you.

220
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,252
We outgrew you-- thousands of years ago.

221
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
I gave your people everything.

222
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,388
Why did you forsake me?

223
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:59,924
Forsake? We threw you out.

224
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,626
The price for your favors was too high.

225
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,328
My tribute was equitable.

226
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,963
I earned your faith.

227
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,548
Really?

228
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,517
What's a fair price for the souls

229
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:10,835
Of my ancestors?

230
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:14,571
Snake face steals souls?

231
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,959
Give Grundy back his soul, snake face,

232
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,528
Or Grundy crush!

233
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,329
You hear Grundy?

234
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,215
Give it back!

235
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:44,184
Where is Grundy’s soul, snake face?

236
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:45,553
Tell Grundy!

237
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:49,523
Tell Grundy, or Grundy crush!

238
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,044
Uh!

239
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:57,298
They aren't attacking.

240
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,167
No, they're running.

241
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:12,546
I think I can seal the breach with the trident,

242
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,866
But I need something to plug the hole.

243
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,219
But what's big enough to--

244
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,054
That could work.

245
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:54,071
Let's find the others.

246
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,473
Oh!

247
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:57,976
[panting]

248
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,623
They're... strong.

249
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,649
Begone!

250
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,679
Aargh!

251
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,535
[groan]

252
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:03,791
Grundy must be close for snake face to fight so hard.

253
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,726
[gasping]

254
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:25,412
[roar]

255
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:41,928
Big ugly monster thing won't stop Grundy.

256
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,798
[groan]

257
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:21,585
Oh...

258
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:22,953
Grundy.

259
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,274
[moan]

260
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,096
Grundy can't move.

261
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:37,418
Bird nose get Grundy’s soul for him?

262
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:40,487
Rest. I'll finish what you started.

263
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,900
Itchtultu: You will not do this thing, Shayera Hol of Thanagar.

264
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:55,736
Itchtultu still has faith in you.

265
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:58,856
So do I.

266
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:22,279
Grundy: Bird nose?

267
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,635
I'm here.

268
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,186
Ahh...

269
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,757
Grundy thinks he is going away now.

270
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:35,576
No. Just hang on.

271
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:50,074
Do you think Grundy’s soul is waiting for him?

272
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,876
Grundy, I don't believe--

273
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:02,019
Yes, it's waiting for you.

274
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:07,875
Then Grundy gets his reward.

275
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,380
[sobbing]

276
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:41,174
I tried to do this according to human customs.

277
00:21:41,242 --> 00:21:43,143
You honor his memory.

278
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,746
He was happy at the end.

279
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:48,782
I still don't understand why.

280
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,518
It's faith, Hawkgirl.

281
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:54,020
You're not supposed to understand it.

282
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:55,589
You just have it.
