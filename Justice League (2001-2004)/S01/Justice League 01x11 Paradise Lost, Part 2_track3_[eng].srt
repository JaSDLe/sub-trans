00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,074
<i>Wonder Woman: Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,675
Home at last.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,710
What?

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,748
Mother! No.

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,517
I should have been here to protect you.

6
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:18,985
Who are you?

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,619
Felix Faust.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,456
I came here in pursuit of ultimate knowledge.

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,059
To gain this, I must find the fragments

10
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,060
Of an ancient sacred relic.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,795
I'll restore your sisters

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,232
If you help me get the other fragments.

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,334
I say we go back and kick that would-be sorcerer's butt.

14
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,805
No. Men are forbidden from ever setting foot on Themyscira.

15
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:41,774
Unh!

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,679
Superman: Diana?

17
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,550
Where's Superman?

18
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,451
[gasps]

19
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,788
What kind of horror have we unleashed?

20
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,790
The relics will soon be here.

21
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,960
And then, lord Hades, the world will be ours.

22
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,126
Powerful forces are at work here.

23
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,262
Tell me something I don't know.

24
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,332
I hope I didn't hurt you.

25
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,432
Let's just say

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,434
I'm glad we're usually on the same team.

27
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,276
I wonder how the others are doing.

28
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,680
Batman, on earphone: Diana, I've dug up something on your friend Faust.

29
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,281
Diana, on earphone: What is it?

30
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,683
I think you'd better see for yourself.

31
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,922
J'onn: Fascinating.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,026
Faust clearly has a great passion for learning.

33
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,529
Where did he get this stuff?

34
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,431
Warlocks 'r' us?

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't touch that.

36
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,838
Oops.

37
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,306
Don't touch anything!

38
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,242
We don't know what kind of powers we're dealing with.

39
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,182
So, who is this Faust?

40
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:06,652
Felix Faust was once a respected professor of archaeology.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,788
But when he became fascinated with the mystic arts,

42
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,025
He was kicked out of the university for his heretical ideas.

43
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,795
He swore revenge on those who mocked him,

44
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,830
And several later disappeared

45
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,199
Under mysterious circumstances.

46
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,737
I have a pretty good idea what happened to them.

47
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,438
Eew!

48
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,673
He's mad.

49
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,342
It gets worse. I found his journal.

50
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,779
The last entries make reference to Tartarus.

51
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,349
The pit of lost souls.

52
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,450
Isn't that just a myth?

53
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,720
If only it were...

54
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,390
Long ago, in ancient times,

55
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,025
My mother Hippolyta fell in love with a god,

56
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,395
Lord Hades.

57
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,231
When war broke out between the Olympian gods

58
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,533
And their ancient foes, the Titans,

59
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,203
Hades struck a treasonous bargain with the enemy.

60
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,172
He would deliver Mount Olympus into the Titans' hands.

61
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,509
In return, he would be given dominion over all humanity.

62
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,078
Hades tricked my mother into opening the gates of Olympus

63
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,747
To the invading Titans.

64
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:11,083
There was a battle of which the muses still sing.

65
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,921
The gods fought back and eventually prevailed.

66
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,889
As punishment for his treachery,

67
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,392
Zeus cast Hades into the pit of Tartarus,

68
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,594
Where he would rule over the dead for all eternity.

69
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,398
And for her unwitting role in Hades' plot,

70
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,868
My mother was charged with guarding the gateway to the underworld.

71
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,103
To make sure the gate could never be unlocked,

72
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,604
Its only key was broken up

73
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,440
And scattered across the globe.

74
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,476
Mother told me she kept one of the pieces in the temple

75
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,412
As a daily reminder of her eternal shame.

76
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,317
Then these relics we've been gathering are parts of the key?

77
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,986
But why would Faust want it?

78
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,488
Only one reason.

79
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,696
He intends to use it.

80
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,665
Where is this gateway to the underworld?

81
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,200
Beneath Themyscira.

82
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,502
Diana, you can't give Faust the key.

83
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,470
If I don't, my mother and sisters

84
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,072
Will remain petrified forever.

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,807
And if you do,

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,443
It could mean the end of the world.

87
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,214
What are you going to do?

88
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,990
Faust: I should thank you

89
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,658
For raising such a devoted daughter.

90
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,627
She was so eager to cooperate.

91
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,129
Faust!

92
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,032
Back already?

93
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
And with hours to spare.

94
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,502
I'm impressed.

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,270
Have you got the relics?

96
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,710
First, free my mother.

97
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,246
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

98
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,649
<i>Raedis vitae.</i>

99
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,919
Ohh..

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,824
Mother.

101
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,726
Faust: After 3,000 years,

102
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,628
The key is finally complete.

103
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,630
Diana, you didn't.

104
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,132
Thank you for your assistance,

105
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,234
But now that your usefulness is over...

106
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,703
<i>Petro fatis!</i>

107
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,870
What?

108
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,538
You're not the only one

109
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,374
With an ace up your sleeve, pal.

110
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,809
What is this?

111
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,178
Unh!

112
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,516
You brought men here to Themyscira?

113
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,050
Did you really think

114
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,885
She'd trust a scum like you?

115
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,555
It's over, Faust. Come along quietly.

116
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,156
Never!

117
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,596
Now you see me,

118
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,364
Now you don't.

119
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,637
Ha!

120
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,904
Whoa!

121
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,173
Unh!

122
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,651
Aah!

123
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,721
Unh!

124
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,697
Aah!

125
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,842
Aah! Aah!

126
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,717
Halt.

127
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,324
<i>Ampaloy!</i>

[grunting]

130
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,650
Come, your highness.

131
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,053
We don't want to be late for the grand opening.

133
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,593
Aah!

[grunting]

137
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,478
Too late. She's gone.

138
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,314
And so is the key.

139
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,015
No.

140
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,364
There's only one place they could have gone.

141
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,899
Follow me.

142
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,888
Whoa. What's that smell?

143
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,157
Don't ask.

I beg you, stop this.

You don't know what you're doing.

147
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,183
I know exactly what I'm doing.

148
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,353
I've dreamt of this moment my whole life.

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,156
Now, let's not keep our new lord waiting.

150

[rumbling]

151
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,362
No!

152
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,978
Hera, help us.

153
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,294
Free at last.

154
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,763
Welcome, lord Hades.

155
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,432
To honor you, I've brought an offering.

156
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,267
Do my eyes deceive me?

157
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,103
Can it be my dearest Hippolyta

158
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,472
Here to greet her lord and master

159
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,008
On his triumphant return from...

160
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,743
Ah, but you know what I mean.

161
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,278
Not a day has passed

162
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,713
That I haven't been reminded of your treachery.

163
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,116
Not a day has passed that I haven't longed

164
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:55,320
To feel the sweet touch of living flesh again.

165

Oh!

My lord,

167
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,724
I've upheld my end of the bargain.

168
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,460
I delivered your freedom and the Amazon queen.

169
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,930
Now I demand what you promised me.

170
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,132
Ah, yes.

171
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,933
Ultimate knowledge.

172
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,268
