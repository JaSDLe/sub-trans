I don't believe it. Rex Mason? - Hey, John.

3
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,563
Meet my fiancée sapphire Stagg.

4
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,899
You're dating the boss' daughter?

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:17,534
I've accepted a job offer in Chicago.

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,818
And I'm going with him.

7
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,036
But you can't!

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,322
Daddy, I'm not your little girl anymore.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,707
I made you,

10
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,476
And I can just as easily unmake you.

11

[screaming]

12
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,317
No. No!

13
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:38,087
Please, you're his friend. You have to help us.

14
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,190
I'll find him, I promise.

15
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,291
Thank you, John.

16
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,294
It was no accident, Simon,

17
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,380
And I want to know who's responsible!

18
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,970
Aah!

19
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:58,308
I want them to see what my creation can really do.

20
00:00:58,376 --> 00:00:59,426
I knew you were jealous,

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,995
But I never thought you'd go this far.

22
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,421
Mase, stop. I never--

23
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,572
I don't want to hear it!

24
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,992
Aah!

26
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,755
Relax, I've got him.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,710
Come along quietly, or I'll--

28
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,345
Aah!

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,514
Mase, don't! You're killing him!

30
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,518
What's happening to me?

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,852
Hawkgirl: Let him go!

32
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,363
Haa!

33
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,648
Uhh!

34
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,521
He's more powerful than I ever imagined.

35
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,474
Huh?

36
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:18,247
Stay back, all of you!

Aaah!

Aah!

43
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,672
That's not going to hold him for long.

How could you?

48
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:51,757
Rex?

49
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,809
You heard me.

50
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,577
How could you dump me like that?

51
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:55,945
What are you talking about?

52
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,665
My so-called buddy Green Lantern.

53
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,367
But who wouldn't rather be with a superhero

54
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,634
Instead of a freak like me?

55
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,641
How could you even think that?

56
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,044
Don't bother denying it. I know what happened.

57
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,281
Shut up and get this through that thick head of yours!

58
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,783
I love you, you big dope,

59
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,284
And I always will, no matter what.

60
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,238
But the pictures-- I saw you and John together and--

61
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,309
Whatever you saw was a lie.

62
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,610
Who showed them to you?

63
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:30,846
It was...

64
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,797
Good lord.

65
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,950
How could I have been so blind?!

66
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,505
Rex, wait. Come back!

67
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,244
Haa!

68
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,429
Uhh!

69
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:53,169
Simon: Well, is Metamorpho everything I promised?

70
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,304
Everything and more, Simon. We want him.

71
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,440
I thought you would.

72
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:59,809
Let's set up a meeting for next week,

73
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,360
And bring your checkbook.

74
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,163
A toast, Java,

75
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,516
To unbridled capitalism.

76
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,284
I don't get it, boss.

77
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:10,119
How are you going to get Mason to work for him?

78
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:13,773
Mason? He was just a prototype.

79
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,808
Now that I've perfected the process,

80
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,476
I don't need him anymore.

81
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,948
So, I'm just a guinea pig, huh?

82
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,582
[growling]

83
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,850
Keep away from-- uhh!

84
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:28,538
Why me, Simon?

85
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:31,907
Was it because I asked too many questions about your pet project

86
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,309
Or because I took your daughter?

87
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:35,628
You leave her out of this.

88
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,564
I'll never let you touch her-- never!

89
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,499
Aah! Uhh!

90
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,336
Fun science fact:

91
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,923
All chemical reactions stop at sub-zero temperatures,

92
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,391
Even yours.

93
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,892
Good work, Java.

94
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,780
What do you want me to do with him?

95
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,831
Dump him.

96
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,987
And then he just turned into smoke and disappeared.

97
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:20,456
Can you think where he might have gone?

98
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,442
No. He wasn't rational.

99
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,961
There's no telling what he might do.

100
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,663
Don't worry. We'll find him.

101
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,750
I see why he always looked up to you.

102
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,153
To me? He was the one who had it made.

103
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,889
No. I've seen him watching you on the news.

104
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,991
The way you're always helping people--

105
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,244
I think he'd trade places with you in a second.

106
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:45,147
Hmm. Guess the grass always looks greener.

107
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,583
I'll bring him back safe, I promise.

108
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,082
So I told my broker,

109
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,950
"industrial waste management--

110
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,419
That's a growth business."

111
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,587
Am I wrong here?

112
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,922
Like they say, garbage in, garbage out.

113
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,957
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

115
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,960
What was that? Aah!

00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,862
Mind if I take the wheel?

117
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,190
What is that thing?!

118
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,224
It's toast!

119
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,632
Think we got him?

120
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,581
Hey, is that the stuff?

121
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,649
Luckily, I was able

122
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,584
To get another shipment of the mutagen...

123
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,020
No thanks to you.

124
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,739
Now we can shift into full-scale production.

Not if I can help it.

Stop him!

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,398
Not this time, Flintstone.

00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,633
Haa! Huh?

00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,545
You did this to me, Simon,

131
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,347
But you won't do it to anyone else.

132
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,548
Ever!

133
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,755
Mason, don't!

00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,372
Looks like we're too late.

00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,093
Maybe not.

Thank heavens you're here.

Let me go.

Haven't you done enough damage?

144
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:56,955
It wasn't me.

145
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,924
Stagg made some kind of synthetic monster.

146
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,275
You've got to believe me.

147
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:03,128
After you tried to deep-fry me? I don't think so.

148
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,363
Look, I'm sorry I went off like that.

149
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,531
I was wrong,

150
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,082
But we can hash that out later.

151
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,036
Right now, there's another monster loose out there.

152
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,240
Did you feel that?

153
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,059
What was it? Felt like an Earthquake.

See? I'm telling the truth.

Let me help.

166
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,275
So, what do you know about this monster?

167
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,876
Stagg was working with a mutagen

168
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,578
When I smashed the controls.

169
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,213
The chemicals came to life.

170
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,532
I think it's the same compound he used on me.

171
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,873
Ok, we'll take it from here.

172
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,525
Wait.

173
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,726
You can't beat it by yourself.

174
00:12:57,794 --> 00:12:59,911
Let me go with you.

175
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:00,996
I don't know.

176
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,831
Batman: He's right.

177
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,833
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

178
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:05,933
You two go.

179
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,669
I'll stay here and test this residue.

180
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,137
Maybe I can find a weakness.

181
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,407
All right, but I'm keeping my eye on you.

182
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,774
That didn't work.

183
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:48,977
Aah!

184
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,858
[coughing]

185
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,691
Are you hurt?

186
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,658
Only my pride.

187
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,949
Uh-oh, more trouble.

188
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,634
No, he's here to help.

189
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,854
I see you've met Stagg’s synthoid.

190
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,905
Learn anything?

191
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:36,207
Yeah-- don't hit it with an energy mace.

192
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,126
Maybe we can talk to it-- reason with it.

193
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,495
Not a chance. It's totally mindless.

194
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,298
J'onn: No, I sensed a mind within the creature--

195
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,033
Incomplete, irrational,

196
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,101
And driven only by base desire.

197
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,036
Maybe the feedback from the accident

198
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,038
Transferred part of Stagg’s mind into it.

199
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,073
So, what's it after?

200
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,476
Oh, no.

201
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:55,394
Newscaster: A gigantic creature

202
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,312
Has defeated the Justice League.

203
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,247
Now it's continuing its rampage

204
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,982
And heading relentlessly uptown.

205
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,117
Residents are advised to evacuate.

206
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,520
Oh, Rex, what's happened to you?

207
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,655
[growling]

208
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:10,158
Sapphire.

209
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:11,592
Rexie?

210
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:12,811
Aah!

211
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,587
Look out!

212
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,174
He's got sapphire!

213
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,796
I'm coming for you, honey!

214
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,320
Let's see how it likes an acid bath.

215
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,898
Green Lantern: No good. He's neutralized it.

216
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,708
Hawkgirl: Look out!

217
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,975
Uhh!

218
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,076
Haa!

219
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,818
I'm ok. Keep going.

220
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:33,841
[coughing]

221
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,918
Aah!

222
00:16:59,001 --> 00:16:59,818
Aah!

223
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,746
Thanks, but this is getting us nowhere.

224
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,616
Batman: Lantern, I've got something.

225
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,801
The creature's composed of artificial protein.

226
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,103
We can destroy it with a complex polypeptide.

227
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,955
Green Lantern: Like a designer amino acid?

228
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,657
How soon can you whip up a batch?

229
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:23,708
That's the problem.

230
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,577
It'll take days to synthesize.

231
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,044
We don't have that long.

232
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,296
Wait.

233
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:30,165
Tell me what's in the stuff. I'll do the rest.

234
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,000
Change into the polypeptide?

235
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,101
Not a chance.

236
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,602
If you come into contact with that thing,

237
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,939
The chemical reaction will destroy you both.

238
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,075
Yeah, you're probably right.

239
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,243
But I don't have time to argue.

240
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,180
Sorry, pal,

241
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:47,682
But sapphire needs me.

242
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,853
Batman: Lantern, are you still there?!

243
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,155
He's resting. What's the formula?

244
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,941
Rex, please, you don't know what you're doing!

245
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,238
What I wouldn't give for a couple of biplanes right about now.

246
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:20,215
Stagg!

247
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,551
Rex?

248
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,421
Mason!

249
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:28,890
Daddy?

250
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,393
It's over, old man. Let her go!

251
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,863
Never!

252
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,400
Ohh!

253
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,211
Daddy, don't!

254
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,201
I love you, Saph.

255
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,606
Rex!

256
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,134
Mase!

257
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,889
[screaming]

258
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,516
The crazy fool!

259
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,089
Aah!

260
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,828
[crying]

261
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,509
I'm so sorry.

262
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:15,246
He was a good man and a real hero.

263
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,582
It would have meant a lot to him to hear you say that.

264
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,409
Sapphire.

265
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,376
[gasps]

266
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,001
Here we go.

267
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,888
Heads up, people!

268
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,612
I wouldn't want to do that again.

269
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,462
Rex?!

270
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,880
You're alive!

271
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,883
You can't get rid of me that easily.

272
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,051
Come here, you big ape.

273
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,308
Still dreaming about the road not taken?

274
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:03,077
What do you think?
