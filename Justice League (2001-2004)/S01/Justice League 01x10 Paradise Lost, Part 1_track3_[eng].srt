What's wrong?

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,375
My mother used to say the planets revolved around me.

She called me her little sun and stars.

You know, I left Themyscira against her wishes.

Maybe you should go back and set things right.

Why did you attack my sisters?

00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:12,907
They left me no choice. I had to defend myself.

84
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,275
By turning them to stone?

85
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:17,611
I came here in pursuit of ultimate knowledge.

To gain this,

87
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:21,615
I must find the fragments of an ancient sacred relic.

And where will I find these relics?

The relics are protected by powerful forces.

Why should I risk my neck when someone else can get them for me?

This is not your concern.

It becomes my concern.

I've already alerted the others.

When they get here,

Of course I don't trust this Faust,

No. Men are forbidden from ever setting foot on Themyscira.

Somebody should have told him that.

Besides, I gave my word

That I would find the other relics.

I fail to see the attraction.

174
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,298
Man, you really are from mars.

175
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,567
Perhaps we should concentrate on finding the relic.

176
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:54,668
No problem.

177
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:59,205
See? That was easy.

178
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,150
Or not.

179
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,865
There must be some mistake.

180
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,902
No. According to the gem, it's in there.

181
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,645
It's like some kind of temple.

182
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:41,181
Yes, for those who worship their credit cards.

183
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,722
How could any female wear such ridiculous garments?

184
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,156
You got me.

185
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,329
Superman: There it is.

186
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,608
Why would it be buried here?

187
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,044
I don't know. I'd say it's been here a very long time.

188
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,746
Someone went to a lot of trouble

189
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,714
To make sure these pieces were never disturbed.

190
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,517
Aah! Aah!

191
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,754
Superman?

192
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,356
[snarling]

193
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,926
Diana... What?

194
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:31,398
What have you done with Superman?

195
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:32,432
Answer me!

196
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,133
[roars]

197
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,904
[screeching]

198
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,081
Ohh! J'onn!

199
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,723
You're toast!

200
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:12,972
You ok?

201
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,275
You get the relic. I'll take care of the rest.

202
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:30,123
Remind me to never get on your bad side.

203
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,424
Unh!

204
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:48,608
Man: Professor Erlich?

205
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,011
No conferences without an appointment.

206
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:53,647
See my secretary if-- aah!

207
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:54,981
Ohh...

208
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:59,786
Tell me about Faust.

209
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,936
Foul demon!

210
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,114
Unh!

211
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,536
Raah!

212
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:54,107
[screaming]

213
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,087
Diana?

214
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,322
Diana, it's me!

215
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,124
Unh!

216
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,130
Diana, stop. It's an illusion!

217
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,364
[roaring]

218
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,102
[grunting]

219
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,974
[grunting]

220
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:51,064
I won't ask again!

221
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,298
[groaning]

222
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:54,234
Where's Superman?

223
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,474
[gasps]

224
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,210
I tried to tell you.

225
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:05,312
[groaning]

226
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:08,981
Superman, I'm so sorry.

227
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,419
What kind of horror have we unleashed?

228
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:19,926
Deep voice: Where is she, Faust?

229
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,095
Where is the Amazon princess?

230
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:24,564
Try to have patience, my lord.

231
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,099
Patience?!

232
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,502
I have been patient for over 3,000 years!

233
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,737
Forgive me.

234
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,707
I simply meant that the relics will soon be here.

235
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,442
I feel it in my bones.

236
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,911
And then, lord Hades, the world will be ours.

237
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:43,349
Indeed it will be.

238
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,519
Indeed it will.
