In our global deep-space monitoring network.

And no one's claimed responsibility?

No. There's more to this than meets the eye.

No. General wells does not speak for our government.

But, senator Carter, only a fool would--

89
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,958
General, when I was an astronaut on Mars,

90
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,360
I survived an experience

91
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,127
Which profoundly changed my life.

92
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:39,196
Looking at Earth from that distance,

93
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:41,048
I saw, for the first time,

94
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,450
How small and fragile our planet is.

95
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,302
Its fate is in our hands.

96
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,638
Ladies and gentlemen, that is a responsibility

97
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:49,640
We must not take lightly.

98
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,259
Therefore, today I propose

99
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,128
A bold new solution for peace,

100
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:55,763

Than any before,

We can't entrust the security

Of the entire world to one man.

108

I understand your feelings, general,

And when senator Carter first approached me,

I was reluctant to get involved.

But after meeting with him and his advisors,

112
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,250
I became convinced that I could make a difference.

It's been 6 months

Since senator J. Allen Carter's

Dramatic disarmament plan was ratified.

126
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,396
While Superman has been working around the clock

127
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,349
To disarm hundreds of deadly warheads,

128

Aah! Aah! Look out!

175
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:12,222
Come on, guys. Are you getting this?

176
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:22,415
We better get out of here before...

177
00:15:57,318 --> 00:15:59,369
[grunting]

178
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:05,158
[grunting]

179
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,913
Aah!

180
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,493
[grunting]

181
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,581
[rumbling]

182
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,170
Whatever that thing is,

183
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:34,671
I've got to stop it.

184
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:35,973
Look!

185
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:52,105
It's not safe here. Get out.

186
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,741
Aah!

187
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,343
Aah!

188
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,827
Are you ok?

189
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:02,699
Freaky.

190
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,467
Superman?

191
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:07,921
Where's he going?

192
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:16,196
Confirmed. We have visual contact.

193
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:17,531
On my mark, fire!

194
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,343
Man: Tactical 7.

195
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,543
Full frontal assault!

196
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,241
After hours of intense battle,

197
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:47,277
The heart of the city lies in ruins.

198
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:49,145
As the devastation continues,

199
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:53,617
The question on everyone's lips is: Where is Superman?

200
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,251
Meanwhile, we're getting reports

201
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,120
That similar objects have landed all around the world--

202
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:58,755
In Paris...

203
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:00,507
Cairo...

204
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,459
Malaysia.

205
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:04,761
And more are arriving by the hour.

206
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,769
[neighs]

207
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:14,521
Easy, girl. Easy.

208
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,773
These omens don't bode well, mother.

209
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,442
Mankind may be facing its darkest hour.

210
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,561
Then mankind will have to face it alone.

211
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,280
How can you say that?

212
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,282
Whatever happens beyond these shores

213
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:26,999
Is not our concern.

214
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:32,054
Here the gods will protect us.

215
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:33,389
I hope you're right.

216
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,480
[gasps]

217
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,401
[banging]

[grunting]

219
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:06,589
Batman: Hold it, Superman!

220
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,909
Destroying government property isn't your style.

221
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,310
What's going on?

222
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,211
See for yourself.

223
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,164
[grunting]

224
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,667
What is it?

225
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:36,569
Mankind's only hope.

226
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,898
He's been trying to reach out to me telepathically,

227
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:50,533
But that stasis field interfered.

228
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,236
When his message finally broke through, I came to rescue him.

229
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:55,638
What's he doing here?

230
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:56,873
[deep voice] the invasion.

231
00:19:58,308 --> 00:19:59,542
I came to warn you,

232
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,411
But I was captured and imprisoned here.

233
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:02,913
They wouldn't listen.

234
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,681
Big surprise.

235
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:07,066
I sense you do not trust me.

236
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,701
Perhaps this will help.

237
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:15,558
I am J'onn J'onzz.

238
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,429
Don't take it personally, J’onn.

239
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,098
He doesn't trust anyone.

240
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,266
A wise policy.

241
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,519
We'll need to contact the joint chiefs right away.

242
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,236
Man: Stop right there, Superman.

243
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:29,356
You're trespassing in a restricted area.

244
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:31,525
Our orders are to keep that freak here.

245
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:34,111
Wait. I'll vouch for him. You must let us go.

246
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:35,545
I don't think so.

247
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,897
But the world's security may be at stake.

248
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:40,884
That's why he'll never leave here alive.
