When do I get my kingdom, mother?

00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,616
Soon, my son.

5
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:38,985
Very soon.

6
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:52,499
The king needs you on the south tower.

7
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:53,716
But the gates?

8
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:54,984
I'll stay and guard them.

Morgaine, my love,

13
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,276
Your beauty has possessed me.

14
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:37,993
How I've longed to hold you,

To feel you in my arms again.

For love, of course.

The love of my son,

Camelot's new ruler.

By base treachery,

00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,355
Camelot will fall this day.

29
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:25,425
You could never understand, Merlin.

30
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,260
You, who are not a man

31
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:28,144
And have never known

32
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:30,529
The sweetness of a woman's kiss.

A viper's kiss, Jason blood.

34
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:37,386
The kiss of a demon in human form.

35
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,622
All my great dreams are undone

36
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,158
In the name of thy tainted love.

37
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:44,777
I've paid for my crime with my life.

Is that not enough?

Nay!

40
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:50,767
Such swift mercy is not for the likes of thee.

41
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,769
Thou art cursed, Jason blood,

42
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:55,871
Until the day this monstrous deed is atoned.

43
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,743
To mark thy eternal shame,

44
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:03,046
I hereby bind thy soul

00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:04,714
To a creature of the pit.

00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,900
Look thee now and see the face

47
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,869
Spawned of thy lust,

48
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:11,671
The face of thy perdition,

49
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,675
The face of thy inner demon.

50
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:28,731
Man: Castle Branek.

00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,482
That's where it is.

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,801
The stone...

53
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:34,403
What? Power...

54
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:37,139
So vast...

55
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:38,491
Poor old codger.

00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,826
Must be delirious.

00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,957
The philosopher's stone.

Man: According to legend,

59
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,593
It was a gem from the hilt of Excalibur

60
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,829
And the true source of the sword's fabled power.

61
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,331
Hello, Jason.

62
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,166
I assume you're not here to browse.

63
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,034
I'm a friend of the owner.

64
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,352
You mean that old man?

65
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,188
He's 32 years old.

66
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:29,208
He's also an expert in Arthurian lore.

67
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,643
What's this all about?

68
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,311
Morgaine le Fey.

69
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:33,513
When Camelot fell,

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,680
Merlin was able to hide

71
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,516
The philosopher's stone from her.

72
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,551
Now she's returned to track it down again.

73
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:39,785
Impossible.

74
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,805
You of all people should know better.

75
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,924
Why does she want the gem?

76
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,843
With it she can resurrect Camelot

77
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,045
And place her son Mordred on the throne.

78
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:49,879
Ok...

79
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:51,297
How close is she

80
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,399
To finding this philosopher's stone?

81
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:54,917
Too close.

82
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,518
Boy: Take that, foul denizen!

83
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,836
What?

84
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,075
Taste cold steel.

85
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,646
Young man, what are you doing here?

86
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:26,916
Morgaine: What boys do, of course.

87
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,337
Here, now!

88
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:32,571
This castle's closed.

89
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,573
And he's just damaged a priceless artifact.

90
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,811
Everything has a price

91
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,013
If you're willing to pay.

[gasps]

93
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:03,703
Now...

00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,404
To the matter at hand.

95
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:14,530
Morgaine: At last, Merlin’s ark,

96
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:17,333
The repository of the philosopher's stone.

97

[gasps]

98
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,377
Gone?

99
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,279
Curse your soul, Merlin.

100
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:31,463
Even in death you taunt me.

101
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,249
Mother, look!

102
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,520
Jason blood.

103
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,054
Doesn't he ever give up?

104
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:41,223
Such an ardent suitor.

105
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:44,059
We must prepare a special welcome for him.

106
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,986
She's been here,

107
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:12,821
But she doesn't have the stone yet.

108
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,223
How can you be sure?

109
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,096
Get down!

110
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,617
Jason, the door!

111
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:32,691
It's sealed shut.

112
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,740
There are too many of them.

113
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:11,547
Oof!

00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:14,584
Jason: Gone, gone, the form of man,

115
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:17,069
Rise the demon Etrigan.

116
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:27,362
Inferno!

117
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:43,763
Etrigan,

118
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,830
You could have warned me.

119
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,150
That witch will pay for this.

120
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:50,419
I'll feast on her cold heart.

121
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:53,422
If the stone's as powerful as you say...

122
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,191
We're going to need help.

123
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:59,761
Wonder Woman: You say you've been trailing le Fey for centuries?

124
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,464
In an unending game of cat and mouse.

125
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,134
For the past generation she has hidden from me.

126
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:08,104
But I'll never rest until her soul burns

127
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,538
In the eternal pit.

128
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:12,274
And I thought bats was creepy.

129
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,510
Grrr!

130
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,629
How has she eluded you for so long?

131
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,131
The witch has an amulet

132
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,400
Which can sense when I'm drawing near.

133
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,635
With that stench, who needs an amulet.

134
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:25,888
What?!

135
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,289
Nothing.

136
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:30,643
J'onn: Perhaps you should consider another approach.

[groans]

138
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:33,328
And what do you suggest?

139
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,164
I could try to locate her--

140
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:36,883
Telepathically.

141
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:48,611
Morgaine: Where?

142
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,145
Where could Merlin have hidden

143
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,849
That infernal stone?

144
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,199
Maybe he didn't.

145
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,319
What if the archeologists who found that castle

146
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:57,720
Helped themselves to it?

147
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,021
I know I would have.

148
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,172
Of course.

149
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,325
Why didn't I-- [gasps]

150
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,993
Mother?! Someone is reaching out to my mind,

Is it...

Him?

154
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,266
No.

155
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,433
A mere amateur.

156
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:14,504
He has no idea who he's dealing with.

Welcome home, my love.

I've missed you, my husband.

164
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,483
And so have the children.

They're alive, too?

Come,

See for yourself.

While you were away

00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,860
I changed the tactile scheme.

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,687
Yes!

176
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:13,938
I am truly home.

Etrigan: You fool!

178
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:22,513
Only a weak-minded simpleton

179
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,149
Would fall for this illusion.

180
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:28,802
How dare you violate the sanctity of my home.

181
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,855
Leave this place!

182
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,222
Not without you.

No!

We thought we lost you, buddy.

186
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,508
Then it was all an illusion.

Perceptive, isn't he?

188
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:17,034
Lay off, gruesome.

Are you all right?

191
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:22,907
Yes, of course.

192
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:24,108
I'll be fine.

00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:25,643
Did you locate le Fey?

No.

195
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:28,863
But I did sense

196
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,231
She hasn't found the stone yet.

197
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,598
Thank Hera for that.

Before she lashed out at me

199
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,468
I heard the words

"archeologists" and "castle."

201
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,206
It's a start.

Don't trust the Martian.

He's been tainted by that witch.

Heed me.

She will tap into your deepest desires.

207
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:01,779
Then dangle them like a carrot

In front of your nose.

209
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,717
She will give you everything you dream of,

210

But only until she gets what she wants.

He'll pass on in a few years anyway.

He has no knowledge of the stone.
