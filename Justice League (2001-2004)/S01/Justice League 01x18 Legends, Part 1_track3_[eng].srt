00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:40,597
Who could be behind a monstrosity like that?

00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,858
Aah!

5
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:09,542
You're only getting one shot, Batman!

6
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,644

Did we win? I'm not sure.

12
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,201
Superman? Batman?

13
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,203
Where'd they go?

14
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,939
Perhaps I can contact them. Wait.

15
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:22,791
Aah!

16
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,181
Easy, big guy.

You all right?

18
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,868
Forgive me. I'm fine.

19
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:34,269
The others can't have gone far.

20
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:35,537
Let's fan out and find them.

21
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,454
Something's not right here.

22
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,306
Looking swell, sweetheart. Hee hee!

[ice cream truck music]

25
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,508
I haven't seen a truck like that since I was a kid.

26
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:16,745
Weird. Do you suppose we got blasted into the past?

27
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:20,315
Nope, the date's right-- but look.

Who was that guy?

48
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,108
Didn't recognize him.

49
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:37,509
Did you hear what he called me?

Yeah-- Green Guardsman?

Nothing at all, cold glass of milk won't cure.

I think I have some freshly baked cookies, too.

101
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,531
Let's let the men talk.

102
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,300
They can talk all they like.

103
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,134
Could you excuse us for a sec?

104
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:09,988
I will not be patronized.

105
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,389
We need answers here.

106
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,158
So maybe, just this once,

107
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,960
We can all play along.

108
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:21,200
So, you fight crime and bake cookies,

109
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,701
How do you do it?

110
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:25,221
This can't be real.

111
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,822
Ha ha! Tell me about it.

112
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,491
I almost busted a gut during that roll call routine.

113
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,527
It's not that. It's the Justice Guild.

114
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:33,662
They're comic book characters.

115
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,080
What? When I was a kid,

116
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:38,067
My uncle James had the biggest comic book collection I'd ever seen.

117
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,834
I'd go to his house every day after school,

118
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,770
And we'd read old comics all afternoon.

119
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,655
So? - So...

120
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:46,525
The Streak, Tom Turbine, Green Guardsman--

121
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,760
They were the stars of my favorite comic book--

122
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,529
The Justice Guild of America.

123
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,597
This is too weird.

124
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,599
I know it sounds corny, but...

125
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:57,202
Those comics taught me what it meant to be a hero.

126
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,603
Without them...

127
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,939
Well, maybe I wouldn't have this ring today.

128
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,340
Ok.

129
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:07,613
Hey, cookie.

130
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,383
One word, and you'll be the fastest man alive with a limp.

00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:17,255
Music Master: We face a new threat.

132
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:18,874
They wore different costumes,

133
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:21,360
But they had the same amazing powers

134
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,111
As our sworn enemies,

135
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,213
The Streak and Green Guardsman.

136
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:26,448
Fiddle sticks!

137
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,033
The Justice Guild foiled your crime,

138
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:29,902
And rather than admit you dropped the ball,

139
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,553
You blame these phantom heroes.

140
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:34,406
Cool it, sportsman!

141
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,675
You want a piece of me, Doctor Blizzard?

142
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,612
Huh?

143
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,314
Enough squabbling.

144
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:46,018
I propose a contest-- no, a wager.

145
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,936
A bet? I'm game.

146
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:51,289
Each of us will see who can pull off the most spectacular crime.

147
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:54,076
The winner will earn the honor of devising a plan

148
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,544
To destroy the Justice Guild...

149
00:10:56,612 --> 00:11:00,448
In addition to making these new heroes disappear...

150
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:03,869
Forever.

151
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:11,442
Tom Turbine: I have a theory on how you came to be here.

152
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,744
As an expert in nuclear physics,

153
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:15,846
I have long hypothesized that there are

154
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:17,781
An infinite number of parallel dimensions,

155
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,484
Each containing its own planet Earth.

156
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:22,987
Each Earth occupies the same location in space

157
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:24,688
But vibrates at a different speed.

158
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,391
Flash, the energy blast you absorbed

159
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,627
Caused you to match the vibration rate of our Earth.

160
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,029
So he created a tear

161
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:33,531
In the dimensional barriers,

162
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,032
Which brought us here.

163
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,151
Hey, it was an accident, ok?

164
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:39,937
But this still doesn't explain

165
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,689
The Justice Guild comics I read when I was a kid.

166
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:43,925
J'onn: Perhaps the creators of those comics

167
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,943
Had a subconscious link to this Earth.

168
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,045
What they thought was merely imagination

169
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:50,814
Was a psychic memory of the Justice Guild's real exploits.

170
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:53,317
I couldn't have put it better myself.

171
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,220
Fascinating. But how do we get back to our world?

172
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,729
I've been tinkering with a prototype trans-dimensional gateway.

173
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:08,533
Flash: Cool. How does it work?

174
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,901
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to harness

175
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,154
A suitable energy source to power it.

176
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,342
Hawkgirl: I guess you're going to be stuck with us for a while.

177
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,244
Don't worry, friends,

178
00:12:20,312 --> 00:12:22,146
I will toil night and day

179
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,264
Until I discover a way to get you home.

180
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:26,250
In the meantime, how about coffee and dessert?

181
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:27,318
Black Siren?

182
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:28,352
Right, chief.

183
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:31,405

184
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:34,308
<i>I am not getting dessert.</i>

186
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:37,361
Saved by the bell.

187
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:40,982
Sergeant O’Shaughnessy, to what do we owe this honor?

188
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:42,750
Sorry to drop by unannounced,

189
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,919
But we received this letter down at the precinct.

190
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:47,088
I rushed it over here as fast as I could.

191
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:49,090
Not as fast as yourself, of course.

192
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:51,258
Well, for someone without superhuman speed,

193
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:53,210
You did just fine, sergeant, thanks.

194
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,935
Jeepers, what does it say?

195
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,436
"to the Justice Guild,

196

Dastardly yours, the Injustice Guild."

201
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:17,284
What kind of criminals tip off the authorities?

202
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,669
Green Guardsman: The worst kind.

203
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:20,621
I doubt there's enough good between the 4 of them

204
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:22,456
To care for a wounded puppy.

205

Justice League, we need your help.

206
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,961
You can count on us.

207
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,145
Ray, the decoder rings.

208
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:37,355
We don't have time to induct you with a formal ceremony,

209
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:39,907
But consider yourselves honorary members of the Justice Guild.

210
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,077
I don't believe it.

211
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,162
You could order rings just like these

212
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,164
Off the back of the old comic books.

213
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,466
Nice plastic.

214
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,000
We should split into teams

215
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:53,404
If we're to have any hope of defeating the Injustice Guild.

216
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:55,473
Let's just go with the person on our left.

217
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,841
So I guess it's you and me, huh?

218
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,077
Can I come? Can I? Can I?

219
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:02,513
I would hesitate to put the boy in harm's way.

220
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:03,964
Sure thing, little buddy!

221
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,550
Oh, boy!

222
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,103
I'll remain here and work on

223
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:11,005
The trans-dimensional gateway.

224
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:13,007
Getting your home is of equal importance.

225
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,475
Thanks.

226

Ladies first.

Right.

Obviously, the clue fire can only mean one thing.

They plan to steal the fabled flame of Rasputin,

A precious ruby necklace on loan to the Seaboard City museum.

231
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:35,813
You know your stuff.

232
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:37,715
It's an honor to fight beside you.

233
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,200
The feeling's mutual.

234
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,368
You're a credit to your people, son.

235
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,387
Uh, thanks.

Abracadabra.

This time we've caught you red-handed.

00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:06,493
Indeed. But I've got one more trick up my sleeve.

240
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,665
Music Master: This calls for a little traveling music.

242

Yes! My hunch about the air crime was dead on.

243
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:24,611
Music Master was after that priceless antique flyer.

244
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,963
I'll stop him.

245
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:30,735
Huh?

00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:31,969
Haa!

247

Stop!

What are you doing?!

249
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,676
We can't destroy that plane!

250
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:41,612
It's an irreplaceable piece of our nation's aviation heritage!

251
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,598
Then how do you suggest we stop him?

252
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,333
By using our wits.

253

Citizens of Seaboard City...

I am proud to unveil this new fountain
