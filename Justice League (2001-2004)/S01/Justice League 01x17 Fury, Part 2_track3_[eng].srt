<i>Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,258
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:11,009
I'm investigating a crime.

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,779
We suspect one of your amazons may be involved.

5
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,998
Hippolyta: I feared as much.

6
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,901
You see, Aresia was not born an Amazon.

7
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:21,220
She comes from man's world.

8
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,572
Her homeland became the battlefield

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,224
For a bloody and senseless war.

10
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,825
Aresia survived,

11
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,244
Clinging to a piece of floating wreckage.

12
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:32,915
Miraculously, she washed ashore here on Themyscira.

13
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,734
Then we amazons adopted her

14
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,720
And magically endowed her with Amazon strength.

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,188
Aresia? Diana.

16
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,759
I'd love to stay and chat,

17
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:45,444
But you might want to look after your friend.

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,746
Superman.

19
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,486
Uhh.

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,771
What is all this?

21
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:58,390
I think we have a right to know.

22
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,227
[coughing]

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,065
Ohh.

24
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,217
Hawkgirl: It's like some kind of plague,

25
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,953
And half the city's got it.

26
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,538
Batman: Yes... The male half.

27
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:21,006
[Sirens]

28
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,885
Emergency response units,

29
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,853
We need backup at 5th and Horton.

30
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,187
Oh...

31
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,806
Woman: Got another one.

32
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,624
Eyes glassy and nonresponsive.

33
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,047
So the poison only affects men?

34
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:48,483
Exactly. That's why it didn't hurt you two.

35
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,851
But why?

36
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,586
What do you have to gain from all of this?

37
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,404
What do I have to gain?

38
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,040
Look around you.

39
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,309
Man's world is filled with greed, deception, and cruelty.

40
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,695
But I'm going to change all that.

41
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,464
Today, we women take control.

42
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,584
You can't be serious.

43
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,052
Can't I?

44
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,617
Lucky I found this one,

45
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:24,435
But he's not doing well.

46
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,788
I'll get him to a hospital.

47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,348
Wonder Woman: Batman!

48
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,685
You were right. It was a renegade Amazon.

49
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,936
I know.

50
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,087
I just couldn't believe

51
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,690
That one of my sisters could actually--

52
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:08,713
Uhh!

53
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,543
Woman: Look out!

54
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,393
[groaning]

55
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,577
Batman!

56
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,207
Wonder Woman: How is he, J’onn?

57
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,942
Just like the others.

58
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,693
Whatever they have,

59
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,111
It appears to be an allergen,

60
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,030
Not a virus.

61
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,817
But I can't seem to isolate it.

62
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,820
Still, every puzzle must have a solution.

63
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,588
So where do we start?

64
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,423
That's easy. We find Aresia.

65
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,196
Even when she was a child,

66
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,031
I sensed a bitterness within her.

67
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,533
She was never really one of us.

68
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:20,168
I think she fits in pretty well.

69
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,503
How can you say that?

70
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,703
Aresia's just taking

71
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:24,005
Your precious Amazon code

72
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,340
To its logical extension.

73
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,741
We don't teach hatred.

74
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,076
Except when it comes to men.

75
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,001
Aargh!

76
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,929
Woman: You there! Halt!

77
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,407
Well done.

78
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:39,998
It's perfect-- absolutely perfect.

79
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,633
For what?

80
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,585
More betrayal, more destruction?

81
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,388
Your highness.

82
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:50,075
You of all people should understand why I'm doing this.

83
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,844
No. You have violated sacred Amazonian law.

84
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:56,998
I'm sorry you see it that way.

85
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,299
Hippolyta: Oh!

86
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,474
But I've come too far to turn back now.

87
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,376
[Sirens]

88
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,782
Do you need help here?

89
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,117
Thanks, but we finally got this one contained.

90
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,656
Any remaining victims?

91
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,825
Just sent the last one to Gotham general.

92
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,927
Good work, ladies. Let's wrap this up.

93
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,167
They seem to be on top of things.

94
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,501
Impressive.

95
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,170
Almost reminds me of home.

96
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,472
Yes, but who wants to live in a world without men?

97
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,124
They can't possibly be that essential to your life.

98
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:44,228
Don't knock it till you've tried it, princess.

99
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,696
Let's find Aresia.

100
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,114
This is Medivac 9 requesting clearance, over.

101
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:12,974
Look out!

102
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,194
Aah! Aah!

103
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,271
I've got you, sisters.

104
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,108
Aah!

105
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,044
Great. Hurry!

106
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:06,811
Star Sapphire: Need a hand?

107
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,749
Relax. I'm not here to fight.

108
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,417
In fact, I came to warn you.

109
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,568
About Aresia?

110
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,803
She's crazy.

111
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,472
She wants to wipe out all the men in the world.

112
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,324
We noticed. Where is she?

113
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,493
She and Tsukuri are at the air base,

114
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,728
But it may already be too late.

115
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,518
That's the last one. All the chemicals are on board.

116
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,989
Good. Then there's just one unfinished matter to attend to.

117
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,791
Woman: And it will remain unfinished.

118
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,846
Oh! Uhh!

119
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,264
Haaa!

120
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,748
Uhh!

121
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,734
[groaning]

122
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,888
What took you?

123
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,945
Forgive our little deception.

124
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,151
Diana, I had Star Sapphire bring you here

125
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,819
So I could offer you one last chance

126
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,388
To join our noble cause.

127
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,340
Man's world may not be perfect,

128
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,442
But destroying it isn't the answer.

129
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:30,161
You would stand against us, your sisters?

130
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,046
Yes. A pity.

131
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,288
Aah!

132
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,891
Aah!

133
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,688
Aah!

134
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,465
Uhh!

135
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:34,209
A valiant effort, Diana, but you won't stop us.

136
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,144
I guarantee it.

137
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,923
Let her go!

138
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,059
You're in no position to give orders here.

139
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:55,963
Don't move! I'm warning you.

140
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,114
I don't want to hurt her, but I will.

141
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,368
Aah!

142
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,237
Aah!

143
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,610
Well done, Sapphire.

144
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:12,212
Tsukuri, get us out of here.

145
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:32,749
Mother!

146
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:41,007
Diana, I found this inside.

147
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,892
The allergen? Has to be.

148
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,578
It might be the key to an antidote.

149
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,114
You take it to J’onn. I'll stop Aresia.

150
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,749
Think you can catch that thing?

151
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,651
It's fast, but so am I.

152
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:02,312
Almost done.

153
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,314
Good. We'll be at the launch site in less than an hour.

154
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:05,265
And then?

155
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:06,850
I shoot these cruise missiles

156
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,251
Into the upper atmosphere.

157
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,752
After they explode,

158
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:13,489
The winds will scatter my poison all over the world.

159
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:16,360
And I can say good-bye to some very unpleasant men

160
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,261
I've known over the years.

161
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:20,663
You can say good-bye to all of them.

162
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,501
[grunting]

163
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:32,142
J'onn, I've got a sample of-- oh, no.

164
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,928
The allergen-- it must have been on Superman's costume,

165
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,131
And when I touched it...

166
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,568
J'onn!

167
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:53,629
What happened?

168
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,398
I've lost the hydraulics.

169
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:01,821
[grunting]

170
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,329
How long can you keep us in the air?

171
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,598
I don't know. We're still losing altitude.

172
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,833
Then we'll have to launch from here.

173
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,067
I'll recompute the coordinates.

174
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,419
[crash]

175
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,638
Go see what that was!

176
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:29,549
Uh-oh. Better hurry with those launch codes.

177
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:56,927
What?!

178
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:07,470
We've got company!

179
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,889
You know what to do.

180
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:00,207
Aah!

181
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,627
You fools, don't you see?

182
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,495
We're not your enemy. It's the men.

183
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:24,114
They must be destroyed.

184
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,749
Hippolyta: You're wrong, Aresia.

185
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,701
Without men,

186
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:30,270
You wouldn't still be here.

187
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,959
After your ship sank,

188
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,127
You must have lost consciousness

189
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,647
As you drifted on your makeshift raft.

190
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:46,435
You would surely have drowned

191
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:50,172
Had the ship's captain not found you and pulled you to safety.

192
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:56,096
Valiantly he struggled to keep you alive...

193
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:01,101
Until he brought you to the shores of Themyscira.

194
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:11,427
[neighs]

195
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:27,443
But the effort was too much for his heart.

196
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:38,371
His final resting place is a simple unmarked grave.

197
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,975
He's the only man ever buried on Themyscira.

198
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,045
So, you see,

199
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,881
For all your hatred of men,

200
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,484
It turns out you owe your life to one.

201
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,803
Why didn't you ever tell me about this?

202
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,273
I didn't think it was important.

203
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,142
<i>I didn't think he was important.</i>

204
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,377
Maybe it's time to reconsider that.

205
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,216
So everything you ever preached was a lie.

206
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,600
Not everything.

207
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:10,053
Still, the acts of one man

208
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,388
Cannot redeem the sins of his kind.

209
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:14,073
They all must pay.

210
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,425
No! Aah!

211
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,474
Haaa!

212
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,266
Haaa!

213
00:18:57,334 --> 00:18:59,602
Bay 2 won't open!

214
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,287
Try number 3!

215
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:07,894
Uhh! Ugh!

216
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:09,929
Ugh! Humpf!

217
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:19,722
Haaa!

218
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,527
Shut the missile off!

219
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,378
It's too late!

220
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:28,114
Wait! You can't leave!

221
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,500
I like you, but not that much.

222
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,375
Poor Aresia.

223
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,944
May the gods grant her peace at last.

224
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,137
How are you feeling?

225
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:27,723
Better. It's a good thing you were able to recover

226
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,392
Aresia's notes from her hideout.

227
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,728
Yes. Without them, we might never have found the antidote.

228
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:33,930
Hawkgirl: Superman and Green Lantern

229
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,464
Have almost finished distributing it.

230
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:43,206
If only Aresia could have learned to see

231
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,208
The noble qualities in you men.

232
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,460
Flash: I definitely could have taught that bad babe

233
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,212
A thing or two about guys.

234
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,897
Too bad we never met.

235
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,367
[burps]

236
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:59,773
Maybe it's just as well.
