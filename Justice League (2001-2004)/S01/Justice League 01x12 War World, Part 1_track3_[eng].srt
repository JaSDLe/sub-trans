Superman: Are you getting this, Hawkgirl?

4
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:33,657
Hawkgirl on radio: As if you were in the next room.

5
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,409
I'm sending your data through backup analysis

6
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,011
Even as we speak.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,847
3 1/2 miles across.

8
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,882
Can you imagine what would happen if it hit the Earth?

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,751
That's not going to happen.

10
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,519
Superman: Ready for the fireworks?

11
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:02,754
J'onn: Ready.

Oh, no.

15
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,534
Superman, the computer says there are

16
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,335
Hydrogen pockets inside that asteroid.

17
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,287
Get away from there before it--

00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,308
[both grunting]

19
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,636
J'onn, Superman?

20
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,537
Come in!

21
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:57,935
Life functions still active.

22
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,037
Incredible. Bring them aboard.

23
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,565
Green Lantern: How could this happen?

24
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,984
You were supposed to be monitoring the situation.

25
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:15,036
Listen, I followed the protocols.

26
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:16,721
And now two of our men are out there,

27
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,289
Injured, maybe worse.

28
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,692
Do you want to stand here pointing fingers,

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,461
Or do you want to do something about it?

30
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:26,964
Let's go.

[screams]

35
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,830
Alien: Your instincts were right about this one, sir.

36
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,582
My tests say he's a kryptonian.

37
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:45,883
Second alien: A kryptonian?

38
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,968
I thought they were extinct.

39
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,487
Apparently not.

40
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,272
A rare specimen,

41
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,191
And quite strong, too.

42
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,327
He should do well on War World.

[crowd chanting]

00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:14,162
Save your cheers.

45
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,948
That's not what Draaga fights for.

46
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,833
Draaga fights for honor.

The great Mongul.

50
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,934
Well said, Draaga.

51
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,602
But I wonder what your opponent thinks.

52
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,271
Don't you?

[cheering]

54
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:48,346
He hails from parts unknown,

At a weight of 720 mass units.

56
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,601
Meet Krodar the terrible!

[crowd gasping]

58
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:04,211
Mongul: He prefers to let his weapons do the talking,

59
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,113
And that's exactly what they'll do

60
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,182
On War World!

Once again,

The winner is mighty Draaga!

00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,893
Shall I spare him, my lord?

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,396

I want you to hear something.

They're expressing their disappointment

80
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,440
At the last specimen you brought.

81
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,593
Great Mongul, please.

82
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,311
A dozen creatures you've found,

83
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,647
And not one of them has been able to

84
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:39,382
Last more than two minutes with Draaga.

85
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,685
I promise, the next one will be different.

86
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:45,122
He's a powerful kryptonian,

87
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,958
Guaranteed to give Draaga the fight of his life.

88
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,477
He'd better.

89
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,057
There it is.

90
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,434
No sign of them.

91
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:21,542
An ion trail.

92
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,043
Looks like a ship's been by here.

93
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,344
A big one.

94
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,174
Unh!

95
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,293
Pathetic.

96
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,111
The whole lot of you.

97
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,481
Not a real warrior in the bunch.

98
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,517
And you, the kryptonian,

99
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:50,187
You're the biggest disappointment of all.

100
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,245
Unh!

101
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:00,714
Why didn't you do that when Draaga was here?

102
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:02,550
It's called turning the other cheek.

103
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,118
I have to find a friend of mine.

104
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:09,089
Guard: Those are the breaks.

105
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:10,791
One minute you're a champion.

106
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,677
The next, you're croc chow.

107
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:15,496
Got to give him credit-- he never begged for mercy.

108
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,095

J'onn? Where are we?

I'm not sure, but we're getting out of here.

112
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,109
Can you stand?

113
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,461
Still weak.

114
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,163
Something in the atmosphere

115
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,781
Is sapping my strength.

116
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,215
Don't strain yourself, I'll--

117
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,251
[roars] aah!

00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,525
This place is starting to get on my nerves. Come on!

122
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,813
Which way now?

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,250
Not that way.

124
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,394
Get back!

Oof!

[grunts]

129
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,670
It's some kind of force field.

130
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,390
Go! I won't leave without you.

131
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,691
You've got a better chance

132
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,327
Of helping me out there, now go!

133
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,113
[groans]

134
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,444
What's wrong?

135
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,413
I'm losing the trail.

136
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:50,733
There are too many others covering.

137
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,084
Think that might be why?

138
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,271
Looks like a refueling port.

139
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,939
If you say so, Sherlock.

140
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,441
What are you waiting for?

141
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,609
Let's check it out.

142
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,878
Who's driving here, anyway?

143
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:10,687
Man: Our nation's food ration is being cut another 15 percent.

144
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,556
And then there are the medical shortages, the power blackouts...

145
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,459
Why do you persist in bothering me

146
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,027
With these petty details?

147
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,597
Petty? But sire, if this continues,

148
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,098
Think of the consequences.

149
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,701
Why, people are already starting to talk about--

150
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,353
Rebellion?

151
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,905
There's not going to be any rebellion.

152
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,975
Not if I can keep giving them fights,

153
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,361
Good ones.

154
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:37,447
Enough to take their minds off their troubles.

155
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:42,819
What's this?

156
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,003
The kryptonian.

157
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,772
He tried to escape.

158
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,658
A pity.

159
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,159
I was hoping to build him up

160
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,994
With some preliminary matches,

161
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,714
But now I'll have to make an example of him.

162
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:57,967
Give him to Draaga!

163
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,297
Unh!

164
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,964
I keep telling you, I don't know nothing.

165
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,817
I mind my own business, and you should, too.

166
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:16,185
Unh!

167
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,338
My friends are missing.

168
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,872
That is my business.

169
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,841
Hey, don't bust my mandibles.

170
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,011
Around here, it's best not to ask too many questions.

171
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,480
Why? There's a lot of stuff going on,

172
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,848
Smuggling, bootlegging,

173
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:30,049

00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,586
Unh!

176
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,963
Oof!

Let me guess,

181
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:02,782
It was something you said.

182
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,119
I could have handled them.

183
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:09,222
I've got more important things to do than saving your butt.

184
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,457
Those 3 knew something, I'm sure of it.

185
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:12,758
And you're letting them get away!

186
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,093
Wanna bet?

187
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,379

[grunting]

189
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,533
Relax,

190
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:22,051
All we want is information

191
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,736
About our friends.

192
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,071
You can talk to me,

193
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:27,774
Or you can talk to her.

194
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,394
I heard something about a kryptonian.

195
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:33,163
He was being taken to War World.

196
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,563
War World?

197
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,865
Nasty place.

198
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,917
Heavy into carnage for the masses.

199
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,569
Take us to this War World.

201
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:50,029
Let them all come and fight me!

00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,683

Move it! You don't want to miss the fight.

00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,668
So many spectators.

207
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,971
Don't they have families or jobs to tend to?

208
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,089
Are you kidding? There's no jobs.

209
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:18,591
I haven't worked in years!

210
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:19,758
That's dreadful!

211
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:21,160
You wanna talk dreadful,

212
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:23,112
You should have seen the last games.

213
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,414
But I hear this kryptonian is a real killer!

214
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,853
Mongul: Today, Draaga meets his greatest foe--

215
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,155
The man from krypton.

216
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,575
Are you ready, kryptonian?

217
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:55,861
I won't fight for your amusement, Mongul.

[crowd gasps]

Mongul: A bold move.

But let's see how long his idealism lasts on...

Draaga,

226
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,792
We don't have to do this!

227
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,743
You don't have a choice.

228
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:45,962
Neither of us does.

Huh?

Enough!

Yes!

A stunning development.

It's unanimous, then.

The people have spoken.

Finish him.

I refuse.

You can't refuse.

Don't make me beg you.

This is your last chance.

No.

276
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,194
Then destroy him!

No!
