00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,045
870 feet.

2
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,046
We drill much deeper,

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,213
And we'll hit New Zealand.

4
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,215
All this for a few stinkin' barrels of oil.

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,135
[rumbling]

6
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,454
Just hope this old mine shaft holds up.

00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,828
[shrieking metal]

8
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,830
[beeping]

9
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,182
Methane gas!

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,500
Shut it down before--

11
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,435
Uhh!

12
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,476
[rumbling]

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,094
[rumbling stops]

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,940
[man screams]

15
00:00:59,008 --> 00:00:59,792
Uhh!

16
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,284
Somebody give me a hand here.

17
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:10,619
Come on! Let's go!

18
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:11,953
Go! Go! Go!

19
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:12,804
Go!

20
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,664
Gentlemen, you have a problem.

21
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:24,499
It was an accident.

22
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,934
There were no fatalities.

23
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,520
You got lucky this time, Mr. Braddock.

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,856
But because of unsafe conditions like this,

25
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:33,124
The unions are demanding higher wages,

26
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:36,845
And the insurance companies won't cover your risk.

27
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,113
Luckily, I've got a solution.

28
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,967
Please enlighten us, Mr. Stagg.

29
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,170
I call it Metamorpho:

30
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:47,506
A chemically altered worker

31
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,790
Who will not merely survive

32
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,442
In most hazardous environments...

33
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,081
But will thrive in them.

34
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:57,916
Stagg, we need a practical solution,

35
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,802
Not some half-baked, computer-simulated fantasy.

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,288
I assure you it's no fantasy.

37
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:05,590
Stagg industries has sunk a fortune

38
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,658
Into developing this.

39
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,543
Hogwash.

40
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,461
I'll believe it when I see it,

41
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:10,495
But not until then.

42
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,137
They want proof?

43
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,973
I'll give them proof.

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,908
All I need is a volunteer.

45
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,628
Man: Yeah, boss.

46
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,129
I got 'em right here.

47
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:35,397
Stagg: Listen carefully, Java.

48
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,465
It's important.

49
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,817
I need those mutagen samples.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,552
Don't let them out of your sight.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,220
Understand?

52
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,206
No problem, Mr. Stagg.

53
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,156
Ow!

54
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,275
Hey!

55
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,562
[grunting]

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,496
Huh.

57
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:54,599
[sighs]

58
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:57,469
All aboard!

59
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,332
Sir, you'll have to check that.

60
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,117
Hey! But my boss said--

61
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,785
I'm sorry. It's regulations.

62
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,505
Oh, boy.

63
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,532
More champagne, Mr. Mason?

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,966
Only if you'll join me.

65
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,301
Maybe when I'm off duty.

66
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:34,455
Now that's service.

67
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:56,577
[crash]

68
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:57,328
Uhh!

69
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,381
Watch your step.

70
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,249
[beeping]

71
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:02,433
We're picking up speed.

72
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,035
Hydraulic systems not responding.

73
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,074
Central, clear the tracks.

74
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,910
We have a runaway. Do you copy?

75
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,344
Fasten your seat belt.

76
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,029
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

77
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:19,984
[bells ringing]

78
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,271
[engine stalling]

[train horn blows]

80
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,212
I can't stop it.

81
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,248
Aah!

82
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:39,037
[screaming]

83
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:39,904
Ooh! Ow!

84
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:40,955
Uhh!

85
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:42,824
Huh? What?

86
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,249
[grunting]

87
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,269
[people screaming]

88
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,310

[grunts]

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,379
Man: Lord knows,

91
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:41,049
If you hadn't slowed it down,

92
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,551
This would have been a whole lot worse.

93
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,519
Man: That's my pal,

94
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:45,887
Always saving the day.

95
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,389
I don't believe it.

96
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,390
Rex Mason?

97
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:49,391
Hey, John.

98
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,725
Still in uniform, I see--

99
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:53,495
Though it's not exactly standard marine corps issue.

100
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:55,246
I signed up with a new unit.

101
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,247
So I heard.

102
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,248
Congratulations.

103
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,916
And what about you, Mase?

104
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,917
Looks like you're not mucking

105
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,918
In the trenches anymore.

106
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,020
Life's been good.

107
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,188
We should catch up,

108
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,655
If you're not too busy for an old pal.

109
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,496
Nice place.

110
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:12,964
Sure beats the old barracks.

111
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,182
Big penthouse,

112
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,684
Traveling first class...

113
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,018
You've done all right for yourself.

114
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:19,353
Working for an outfit like Stagg Enterprises

115
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,488
Does have its perks.

116
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,690
No kidding.

117
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,775
But so must wearing that ring.

118
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,028
A big hero like you makes a fortune on the side, right?

119
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,864
It doesn't work like that.

120
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,598
I've hardly got more than the clothes on my back.

121
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,599
Woman: Well then,

122
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,268
We simply must take you shopping.

123
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,128
John Stewart, meet my fiancée Sapphire Stagg.

124
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:46,982
Man: We can no longer support...

125
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,200
Second man: Can we get a statement, sir?

126
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,201
Third man: Any idea what caused this?

127
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,402
Fourth man: Terrorists?

128
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,569
Woman: Mechanical failure?

129
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:52,737
No statement until we've completed our investigation.

130
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:53,905
Was there a bomb on board?

131
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,906
Is the railroad liable?

132
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,242
[all talking at once]

133
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,943
You're dating the boss' daughter?

134
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,196
I told you this job had great perks.

135
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,797
Only thing is, daddy doesn't know yet.

136
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:23,567
You always did like living dangerously.

137
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,370
I like a little danger, too.

138
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,804
Don't you, Mr. Stewart?

139
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,025
I take it the old man wouldn't approve.

140
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,260
Nobody's good enough for Simon Stagg’s little girl.

141
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,881
He'd blow a gasket if he found out.

142
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,016
I'm gonna dry off,

143
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,335
But don't go away, 'kay?

144
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,507
Remember, I saw her first.

145
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,241
[earphone rings]

146
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,326
Excuse me.

147
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,498
Batman: I checked out that train you saved.

148
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,216
Green Lantern: And?

149
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,067
The crash was caused by a chemical.

150
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,137
Someone was illegally carrying a mutagen compound.

151
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,355
I see.

152
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:01,389
Thanks.

153
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,040
Something you want to tell me?

154
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:04,075
What do you mean?

155
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,994
That train lost control today

156
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,028
Because of unstable chemicals

157
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:07,995
In the baggage car.

158
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:09,664
It was a mutagen.

159
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,333
Only someone working for a company like Stagg Enterprises

160
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:13,968
Could get their hands on that stuff.

161
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:14,769
You're crazy.

162
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:16,587
Why would I take that kind of risk?

163
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,806
You always said you'd do anything to get ahead.

164
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,359
Do I detect a hint of jealousy?

165
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,361
Of you?

166
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,462
I've got nothing more to say.

167
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,369
I see.

168
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,171
Call if you change your mind.

169
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,364
What happened to your friend?

170
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:44,632
Something came up.

171
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,369
Stagg: You idiot!

172
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:51,339
I told you not to let that case out of your sight.

173
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,557
Sorry, boss.

174
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,725

He was running an errand for me, that's all.

Was his errand picking up a load of illegal mutagens?

00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:42,863
Wealthy, successful...

349
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,998
Engaged to a beautiful woman.

350
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:45,999
[earphone rings]

351
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,084
It's Mase.

352
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:48,219
Are you all right?

353
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,371
John, we have to talk.

354
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,388
I'll be right there.

355
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,007
Stay here until the police arrive.

356
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,209
Wait!

357
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,136
Mase, where are you?

358
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,738
Mason: Right here.

359
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,156
Aah!

360
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:10,174
Unh!

361
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,997
I knew you were jealous,

362
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,216
But I never thought you'd go this far.

363
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:23,103
I don't know what you're talking about.

364
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:23,904
No?

365
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:26,223
See if this jogs your memory.

366
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:29,827
[shouting]

367
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:30,677
Uhh!

368
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,633
Stagg: Are you getting this, Java?

369
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,770
I want them to see what my creation can really do.

370
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,271
[explosion] whoa!

371
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,091
It might even have military applications.

372
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:46,359
Hah!

373
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,000
I won't let you take her from me.

374
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:55,319
Mase, you're making a big mistake.

375
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,087
No, you did.

376
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:07,964
And it will be your last, old friend.
