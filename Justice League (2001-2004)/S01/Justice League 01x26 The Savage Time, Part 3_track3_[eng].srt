00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,558
Vandal savage is the undisputed dictator

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:12,526
Of this unholy regime

4
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:13,660
Since World War II.

5
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,779
But we won that war, didn't we?

6
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:16,997
Batman: No. They did.

7
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:19,917
J'onn: We only have 48 hours before it collapses.

8
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:22,703
Superman: Those troops are getting decimated.

9
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,439
You help them. I'll fly to Berlin.

10
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,640
Flash: Where's G.L.?

11
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,808
Hawkgirl: His ring went out.

12
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:29,226
He's stranded back there.

13
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:31,061
You're a strange one, Steve Trevor.

14
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:34,331
You have no special powers, yet you're willing to risk your life here.

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,517
Some things are worth dying for, angel.

16
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:37,701
There's an enemy airfield

17
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:38,869
Around here somewhere,

18
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,672
And our job is to turn it into Swiss cheese.

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,407
Welcome to E.Z. Company, soldier.

20
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,593
Hawkgirl: Some kind of factory complex.

21
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,012
It's defended by antiaircraft batteries.

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,098
If you can take those out, we can cripple the factory.

23
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,051
We just learned that one of our coded communicators is missing.

24
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:55,285
Imbecile!

25
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:56,887
Get it back or destroy it!

26
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,438
If we can break the code,

27
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,407
We can listen in on the Axis high command

28
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:02,175
And find out when the invasion is.

29
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,695
Steve: It's a trap!

30
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,755
I tried to warn you.

31
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,791
They know you've got the communicator,

32
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,092
And they want it back.

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,193
Give it to me.

34
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,765
What are you doing?

35
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,300
Trust me.

36
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,528
Brace yourselves!

37
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:15,009
Unh.

You were lucky, Hoffman.

43

The stolen communicator has been destroyed.

44
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,455

45

Begin operation endgame.

46

It's safe now.

47

I understand.

52
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,376
Ok. Now that they think this thing is kaput,

53
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:59,012
Let's see if you can figure out how it works.

54
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,005
We should be nearing the target.

That's the last cannon. We're clear to make our run.

Let's make it count.

Good work, Flash.

You saved all those workers.

We've cased the whole area.

Maybe G.H.Q. Got some bad info.

80

Yeah. Wouldn't be the first time.

81
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,092
Or maybe the map's no good.

82
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,827
You're right. This hill isn't even on it.

83
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,362
I wonder.

84
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,202
You're so smart, why don't you go find the runway

85

With your magic ring?

Enough of that, dozer.

What do we need you for anyway?

00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:44,945
You're a big man when your ring's working,

90
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,297
But without it, you're just-- ah!

What in blazes...

92
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,067
I thought so. The hill's a phony.

Yes. I've got it.

Oh, no.

The invasion. It's starting.

103
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,740
Does it say where they're going to land?

104
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,241
Dover, Brighton?

105
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:49,843
Britain is not their target.

106
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,931
They're invading America.

107
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,491
I'm not sure the signal is strong enough.

108
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:07,860
We've got to alert the Allies. Keep trying.

109
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:12,231
It's not too late. I can still stop the invasion.

110
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,933
Wait.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,835
What if I never see you again?

No time to call for backup.

Maybe we could string some mines across the tarmac.

Too late for that. Look.

171
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,250
[loud banging]

172
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:18,971
What now?

173
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:33,319
What are you waiting for? Shoot them out of the sky!

174
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:38,874
Unh!

175
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:58,277
Behind you!

176
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,515
This isn't going to be easy.

177
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,284
Wonder Woman: When is it ever?

178
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:18,580
Hunh!

179
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,778
Let's go get 'em.

180
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,155
[beeping]

181
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:02,158
<i>The wiring is repaired, mein fuehrer.</i>

182
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:03,625
All systems operational.

183
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:06,428
Then signal the others. Fire the afterburners.

184
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,198
Unh!

185
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,717
Aah!

186
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,283
They're getting away!

187
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,500
Maybe not.

188
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:35,858
What?

189
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,537
What did I tell you? Right on schedule.

190
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,297
Take evasive action!

191
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,771
You're not going anywhere.

192
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,457
You think you can kill me?

193
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,092
You're welcome to try.

194
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:16,648
Aah! Aah!

195
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,052
Aah!

196
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:31,080
Lantern.

197
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:32,264
Aah!

198
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,849
J'onn!

199
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,722
Green Lantern.

200
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,592
I'm sorry. We didn't have time to tell you. We lost--

201
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,394
No. He's here, onboard that plane.

202
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,013
What?

203
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,168
Say your prayers, savage.

204
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:54,820
Unh!

205
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,006
A god doesn't grovel.

206
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,041
Unh!

207
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,609
Hah!

208
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:02,794
Hawkgirl?

209
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:03,979
Come on! Let's go!

210
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:13,022
[gasps]

211
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:15,541
Aah!

212
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,429
What took you?

213
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:23,599
I had to fix my hair.

214
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:38,547
They're turning back! We did it!

215
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:39,815
[cheering]

216
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:44,402
Shouldn't we go after them?

217
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,287
I don't think we'll need to.

218
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,331
Hawkers!

219
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:21,556
Hoffman: Savage's plan has failed.

220
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:25,210
His ridiculous air force has been utterly destroyed.

221
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,996
But despite these setbacks, we must fight on.

222
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:30,632
But who will lead us, Herr general?

223
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,005
Who, indeed?

224
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,624
Home sweet home...

225
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:13,892
I hope.

226
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,894
Batman: I should have known you'd be here.

227
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:19,797
The instruments in the Watchtower

228
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,234
Picked up this anomaly a few hours ago.

229
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:26,405
Batman! It's really you!

230
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,974
Am I missing something?

231
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,376
Ahem.

232
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:32,077
Uh, sorry. It's just that...

233
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,083
Well, it's a long story.

234
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,085
Hawkgirl: You're not going to believe what we've been through.

235
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,353
Try me.

236
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,895
Please keep your visit short.

237
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,730
He tires easily.

238
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:10,299
Thank you.

239
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:21,744
Wonder Woman: Steve?

240
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,617
Angel.
