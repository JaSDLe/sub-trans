Green Lantern: The Streak, Tom Turbine, Green Guardsman--

Consider yourselves honorary members of the Justice Guild.

8

Tom Turbine: I have long hypothesized

9
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:28,610
That there are an infinite number

10

Of parallel dimensions,

11
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:32,313
Each containing its own planet Earth.

Don't worry, friends.

13
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,116
I will toil night and day

14

Until I discover a way to get you home.

Aaaaah!

16
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:44,258
A sudden dizziness-- so strange.

17
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:46,077
I propose a contest.

18
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,829
Each of us will see who can pull off

19
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:49,530
The most spectacular crime.

20
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:51,332
The winner will earn the honor

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,435
Of devising a plan to destroy the Justice Guild.

No.

It's true. I saw the grave.

26
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,598
But it doesn't make any sense.

27
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,317
Hawkgirl: Look, I don't know who that is,

28
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,336
But the real Green Guardsman is gone,

29

And so are the rest of them.

30

No. I don't believe it!

31

He seemed to take this quite personally.

32

I'll bring him back. Wait here for Flash.

Gentlemen, that's why I lead the league in steals.

Don't be so fast to toot your own horn, sportsman.

Then it appears we have a hat trick.

That leaves Dr. Blizzard out in the cold.

I'd say this entitles me

Oh, no.

Much bigger plans.

Now they're escaping by blimp.

Only they would commit such a heinous act, and on a Sunday!

00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:38,383
Where's G.L.?

348
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,160
Are you ok?

349
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,029
It's stupid, really.

350
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,464
Why should I feel like this?

351
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,699
I mean, they weren't even real.

352
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,202
They gave their lives for us.

353
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,237
That's real enough for me.
