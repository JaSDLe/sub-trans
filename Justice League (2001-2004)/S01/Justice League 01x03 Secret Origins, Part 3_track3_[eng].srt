Unh! What happened?

3
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,748
Help has arrived.

4
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,702
You came from Mars to warn us?

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,170
We first encountered them

6
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:21,005
A thousand of your Earth years ago.

7
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:23,941
They were determined to make our planet their own.

8
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:28,830
I was the only survivor.

9
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,633
The invaders had nothing left to feed upon,

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:34,052
So they turned their sights to Earth.

11
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,405
They want to blot out the sun

12
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:40,075
So they can live in perpetual darkness.

13
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:42,410
We'll have to take out those factories.

14
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,913
Lady, this is no job for amateurs.

[coughing]

16
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:52,019
It's the central core-- the ion matrix crystal.

17
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,822
If we can remove that, we'll shut down the whole plant.

Unh! Done. I thought we'd never

22
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,773
get this dish back on-line.

23
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,541
Man: Are you sure you hooked it up right?

24
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,859
Yeah. Why?

25
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,994
My readings are off the chart.

26
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,613
Something's coming this way--

27
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,532
Something really big.

28
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,942
Government sources have confirmed the approach

29
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,711
Of another object from space.

30
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,013
They predict it will be roughly 5 times the size

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,347
Of the first landers.

32
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,766
Senator J. Allen Carter had this to say--

33
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,936
In the face of this new development,

34
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,638
We are calling on the public to remain calm.

35
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,390
I always wanted one of these.

36
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:53,891
But what if we get caught?

37
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,393
What difference does it make?

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,894
The world's coming to an end anyway.

Perhaps mother was right about mankind.

They're nothing but untamed savages.

45
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:12,292
Do not judge them too harshly.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,829
They act out of fear.

Thanks, man.

52
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:37,534
Sorry we're late. Had to stop and help some civilians.

What'd you call us back for?

54

Superman's been captured.

He's trapped somewhere inside there with Hawkgirl.

Whoa.

57
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,080
And what about Batman?

58
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,898
He acted heroically...

To the very end.

60
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:54,368
The bat's gone?

61
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,705
He was a true warrior.

This is not good. Definitely not good.

I can't believe we're doing this again.

Yes. Your friends are alive, but we must act quickly.

The who?

72
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,702
The supreme intelligence

73
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,172
That controls these invaders.

We have met before.

00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,891
The crystal-- destroy it!

176
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,683
It's shielded!

177
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,828
[gasps]

178
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,780
[aliens shouting]

179
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:47,016
Aah!

180
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:53,372
[grunting]

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,540
No!

182
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,477
You live underground and shun the light. Why?

183
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,829
Does it burn your pale, putrid skin?

184
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,548
[screaming]

185
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,735
Ooh, that's one nasty sunburn.

186
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,621
Ultraviolet rays.

187
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,306
Coming from the depths of space,

188
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:11,524
The invaders have no resistance

189
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,925
To our sun's radiation.

190
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:20,099
So you did find their weakness after all.

191
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,901
Aah! Aah!

192
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,069
Destroy them!

193
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,292
Unh!

194
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,710
[grunting]

195
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,173
Unh!

196
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,278
Hah!

197
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,105
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

198
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,940
Hah! Hah!

199
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,210
Unh!

200
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,615
Aah! Aah! Aah!

201
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:19,792
Aah! Aah!

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,650
[grunting]

203
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,754
Aah! Aah!

204
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,135
Imperium!

205
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,853
Unhand me, worm!

206
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:48,771
Unh! Oof!

207
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,174
[gasps]

208
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,443
No!

209
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,042
Unh!

210
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,286
Aah!

211
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,351
Hah!

212
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,818
Hah!

213
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,269
Hah! Hah!

214
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,826
Hah!

215
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,229
Aah!

216
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,558
We'd hate to lose you again.

217
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,744
Maybe we'd better get out of here.

218
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,146
Not without them.

219
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:29,471
Unh!

220
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:33,342
Aah!

221
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,193
Unh!

222
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,677
Flash, give me a hand.

223
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,947
Ew, gross.

224
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,081
Now!

225
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,486
The whole place is going to blow!

226
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,323
Everybody, stay close.

227
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,661
This is Snapper Carr. In the aftermath

228
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,063
Of the metropolis meltdown,

229
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,715
Most of the invaders have retreated from Earth.

230
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:49,168
Superman and a team of other heroes

231
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,854
Have driven out the remaining pockets of resistance,

232
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:55,240
Helping to restore order around the world.

233
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,645
Despite this stunning victory,

234
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,214
Some are warning that we must remain vigilant.

235
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,016
We got lucky this time.

236
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,219
What will we do if the invaders ever return?

237
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,346
Superman: Incredible.

238
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,583
Do your stockholders know about this, Bruce?

239
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,802
A line item hidden in the aerospace R&D budget.

240
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,538
This Watchtower will act as an early-warning system

241
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,258
For detecting other threats of invasion from space.

242
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,143
And it also has a fully stocked kitchen.

243
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,045
Iced mocha? No, thanks.

244
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,563
[slurping]

245
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,933
Mmm. They don't have these on Themyscira.

246
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,669
Stick around, princess. I'll show you the ropes.

247
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,005
Perhaps I will.

248
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,406
John: An impressive installation.

249
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,544
Most impressive.

250
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,229
But what's it got to do with us?

251
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,535
I once thought I could protect the world by myself,

252
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:14,603
But I was wrong.

253
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:17,306
Working together, we saved the planet,

254
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:20,242
And I believe that if we stayed together as a team,

255
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,261
We would be a force that could truly work

256
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,231
For the ideals of peace and justice.

257
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,967
What, like a bunch of super friends?

258
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,952
More like a Justice League.

259
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:34,406
Do you have any idea how corny that sounds?

260
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,725
But maybe the big guy's got a point.

261
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,961
With all of us behind it, it just might work.

262
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,195
Count me in.

263
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,530
Me, too.

264
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,303
Hawkgirl: And me.

265
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,121
My mother may not approve,

266
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,189
But I find man's world to be intriguing.

267
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,191
I'll gladly join.

268
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,844
What about you, Batman?

269
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:58,397
I'm not really a people person,

270
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,133
But when you need help-- and you will--

271
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,235
Call me.

272
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,770
Understood. Then we're all agreed.

273
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,472
Wait. J'onn's not here.

274
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,573
Yeah. Where is he?

275
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,934
J'onn, are you all right?

276
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:21,870
My family and loved ones are long gone.

277
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,507
I am the last of my kind.

278
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,041
I know the feeling.

279
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,493
Now Mars is dead,

280
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,429
And I am alone in the universe.

281
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,267
J'onn, we can never replace the family you've lost,

282
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,802
But we'd be honored

283
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,271
If you could learn to call Earth your home.

284
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,044
Come on.
