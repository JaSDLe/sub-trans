00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:09,362
When I was an astronaut on Mars,

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,064
I survived an experience

4
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,383
Which profoundly changed my life.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,952
I propose a bold new solution for peace.

00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,354
Carr: With more missiles being dismantled every day,

7
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:19,273
Most of us will sleep better

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,475
Knowing that Superman is watching over us.

9
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,326
Batman: Over the past few months,

10
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:25,412
I've detected several security breaches

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,448
In our global deep-space monitoring network.

12
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:30,317
There's more to this than meets the eye.

Unh! Aah!

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,685
Carr: We're getting reports that similar objects

17
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,870
Have landed all around the world.

18
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:54,407
I am J’onn J’onzz.

19
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:56,843
Our orders are to keep that freak here.

20
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,962
But the world's security may be at stake.

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,932
That's why he'll never leave here alive.

22
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,374
Mother, forgive me.

23
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,618
It's them.

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Unh!

25
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,059
Unh...

26
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,278
Stay down.

00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,935

00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,955
Unh!

00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:24,874
Unh!

30
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:26,209
J'onn, are you--

[groans]

32
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,362
Hang on!

33
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,947
Get him to safety. I'll cover you.

Unh!

36
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,107
That was close.

37
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,208
We're not safe yet. Look.

38
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,017
Aah!

[straining]

40
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:52,862
What happened?

41
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,648
Help has arrived.

42
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:10,330
Unh! Unh!

43
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:13,216
Hawkgirl? What's she doing here?

44
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,607
Sorry I'm late. There was an uprising near Rigel IX.

Aah!

00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:09,873
Unh!

49
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,148
Allow me.

50
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,128
Who's the rookie in the tiara?

51
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:33,629
I'm not sure.

52
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:34,964
Unh!

53
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,734
Thanks.

Flash: Hey, bats!

55
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,743
I think you dropped this.

56
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,382
Whoa. Where have you been all my life?

57
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,550
Themyscira.

58
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,267
Huh?

59
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,852
Hawkgirl: The home of the amazons.

60
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,938
I always thought it was merely a legend.

61
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:01,358
I assure you, it's as real as the ground on which we stand.

62
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:04,027
I am Diana, princess of the amazons.

63
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,462
Pinch me. I must be dreaming.

64
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,863
Ow!

65
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,099
Themyscira is protected by the gods,

66
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,369
But I could not idly stand by while the rest of the world was in danger.

67
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,871
It was lucky you showed up when you did.

68
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:17,857
No, not luck. I telepathically summoned them.

69
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,709
Look, I'm usually pretty quick on the uptake,

70
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:23,362
But would someone please tell me what the heck is going on here?

71
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,105
Diana: So, J’onn J’onzz, you came from Mars to warn us?

72
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:34,940
This is just too weird.

73
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,659
I've seen stranger things.

74
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:37,877
We first encountered them

75
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:40,380
A thousand of your Earth years ago.

76
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:45,618
It was a golden age.

77
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:48,288
Our Martian civilization was at the height

78
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,623
Of its peace and prosperity.

79
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,458
And then...

80
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,744
They arrived.

81
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:59,449
Where they came from, no one knew,

82
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:03,169
But they were determined to make our planet their own.

83
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,137
We Martians were peaceful people,

84
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:24,007
And the taking of any life was abhorrent to us.

85
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:33,650
But we quickly learned the ways of war.

86
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,753
For centuries, the battles raged on.

87
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:39,355
Every trace of our once-great civilization

88
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,757
Was obliterated.

89
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:44,193
We fought valiantly,

90
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:48,314
But the invaders were parasites who fed on our psychic energy.

91
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:55,588
As we grew weaker, they grew stronger.

92
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:59,058
They even absorbed our shape-changing abilities.

93
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:02,028
Finally, a small group of Martian survivors

94
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:05,098
Planned one final desperate attack.

95
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,158
Unh! Unh!

96
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:24,750
Aah!

97
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:29,272
[beeping]

98
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,240
Inside their underground stronghold,

99
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:35,045
We unleashed a powerful nerve gas which paralyzed them.

100
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,696
[shrieking]

101
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,494
The attack was successful,

102
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:11,113
But the cost was dear.

103
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,549
I was the only survivor,

104
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:16,219
The last of my kind.

105
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:17,920
I sealed up their citadel

106
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:21,791
To keep them in a constant state of suspended animation.

107
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,893
For over 500 years,

108
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:25,344
I stood guard over them,

109
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:28,347
But then, while I was in a hibernation cycle,

110
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,850
Astronauts from Earth unsealed the stronghold

111
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,352
And accidentally revived the invaders.

112
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,521
Flash: Wait. Those astronauts

113
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,857
Never said anything about finding life on Mars.

114
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:39,692
Hmm. Some pencil pusher in Washington

115
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,194
Probably decided it should be

116
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,862
Classified information.

117
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,763
With all the Martians gone,

118
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:47,316
The invaders had nothing left to feed upon,

119
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:49,886
So they turned their sights to Earth.

120
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:53,639
I narrowly escaped and came here to warn of the coming danger.

121
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:56,209
While I was being held against my will,

122
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:59,212
The invaders sent advance agents to disable Earth's defenses.

123
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,381
That's why they sabotaged the deep-space monitoring network--

124
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,984
So we couldn't detect their activities.

125
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,320
We've got to stop them before it's too late.

126
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:10,089
It may already be too late.

127
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,141
Carr: This is Snapper Carr reporting live

128
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,876
From ground zero in metropolis,

129
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:17,647
Where the alien walkers continue to clear the area around the impact site.

130
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:18,948
General wells,

131
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:21,484
Our military seems unable to stop them. Why?

132
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,653
All our big missiles have been disarmed,

133
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,656
And our self-proclaimed protector Superman has abandoned us.

134
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:28,124
Earlier,

135
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:30,827
Senator J. Allen Carter had this to say.

136
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:32,795
When I first proposed my peace initiative,

137
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:34,713
No one ever imagined we would face

138
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,282
An invasion like this.

139
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:39,151
Now we must stand together and resist this aggression.

140
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:42,388
Uh, wait. We have a breaking development.

141
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:45,175
Something's moving inside the crater.

142
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,069
Oh, my lord.

143
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:37,560
[thunder]

144
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:39,594
What was that?

145
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:41,664
It's begun.

146
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,426
[thunder]

147
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:56,462
What are they doing?

148
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,029
The invaders are nocturnal.

149
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:02,468
They want to blot out the sun so they can live in perpetual darkness.

150
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:03,902
Friends of yours?

151
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,587
It's no joke.

152
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,288
What's the big problem?

153
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,791
Can't you just whip up another batch of that nerve gas?

154
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,259
Unfortunately, no.

155
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,279
The gas can only be made from a rare Martian plant.

156
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:18,416
I brought a sample with me, but it was destroyed when I was captured.

157
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,785
Uh, what's plan "b"?

158
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,071
We'll have to take out those factories.

159
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:25,574
Lady, this is no job for amateurs.

160
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,576
We amazons are warriors born.

161
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,745
Want to test me?

162
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,113
Let's not fight among ourselves.

163
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:35,134
J'onn, we're going to need all the help we can get.

164
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,419
Fine. Sorry... Your highness.

165
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,387
Tactically, we'll have multiple objectives,

166
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,973
So we'll need to split into teams.

167
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,758
Dibs on the Amazon.

168
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:49,314
You are no fun.

169
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:51,316
This isn't supposed to be fun.

170
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,734
We've got a job to do,

171
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:55,153
And we will do it better without distractions. Understood?

172
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,289
Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

173
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,168
That's our target. Now, listen up. Here's the plan.

174
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,520
What plan? We kick their butts, right?

175
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:14,572
Let's get this over with.

176
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:16,875
[sigh]

177
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:20,645
[whistles]

178
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:22,664
Hey! Over here!

179
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:27,336
Hah! Missed me!

180
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:36,444
Aah!

181
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:39,714
Oh!

182
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:45,887
[grunting]

183
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,121
Fool.

184
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:53,628
Green Lantern: Hang tight, hotshot.

185
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,672
Huh. I'm sort of stuck here.

186
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,024
I hope the others are having better luck than we are.

187
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:21,373
Hiding like cowards is not the Amazon way.

188
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,991
They must have a weakness.

189
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,993
When we find it, we'll strike.

190
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,883
I have scouted the outer walls. There are no openings.

191
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,919
Then we'll make our own.

192
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:36,605
Wait. Let's see what she can do.

193
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,389
Hera, give me strength.

194
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,824
Unh!

195
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,838
There's your opening.

196
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,576
Not bad.

197
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,908
They run like cowards. What are you waiting for?

198
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,703
Hah!

199
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,037
Unh!

200
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:49,944
[grunting]

201
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,214
Hawkgirl, follow me!

202
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,406
Keep a sharp eye out.

203
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,607
I always do.

204
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,048
Stay back! I'll--

205
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:12,717
Hah!

206
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:13,685
Unh! Unh!

207
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,806
Whoa.

208
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:21,258
What? There's a time for words and a time for action.

209
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,798
J'onn: Of all the idiotic, boneheaded,

210
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:27,999
Glory-grabbing moves!

211
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,068
Haven't you ever heard of teamwork?

212
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:33,604
Uh, maybe we'd better save the motivational speeches till later.

213
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:35,940
Unh!

214
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:42,563
[coughing]

215
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,855
G.L.!

216
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,976
Uh-oh. Got to run.

217
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,744
They're close by. I can almost smell them.

218
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,112
Are you always so eager to fight?

219
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,449
My home Thanagar is a warlike world.

220
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:20,551
There, one must strike first or die.

221
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,077
[coughing]

222
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:34,565
Hang on, Hawkgirl! I'll--

223
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,267
Aah!

224
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,321
Unh!

225
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:49,097
They've blocked us off again.

226
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,764
It's almost as if they know what we're thinking.

227
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,021
Any ideas, J’onn?

228
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,190
J'onn!

229
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:02,593
Superman and Hawkgirl are down.

230
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,562
They have failed.

231
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,731
What? Are you sure?

232
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,617
I can sense it. This way. Hurry.

233
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,573
We lost them.

234
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,008
For the moment.

235
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,178
J'onn: Look.

236
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,550
It's the central core.

237
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,406
How can we shut it down?

238
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,342
The ion matrix crystal.

239
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:54,095
If we can remove that, we'll shut down the whole plant.

240
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:55,263
I'll need a diversion.

241
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:56,914
You've got it.

242
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,170
Unh!

243
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,654
Aah!

244
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:28,496
Unh!

245
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,234
J'onn!

246
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,273
Batman: Get him out, now!

247
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:40,391
Unh!

248
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,643
Unh! Unh!

249
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,065
Batman!

250
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,639
[gunfire]

251
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,725
No!

252
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,177
Wait. There's nothing more we can do for him.

253
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:17,411
You don't mean he's--

254
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,630
Gone.

255
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,383
Hera, help us.
