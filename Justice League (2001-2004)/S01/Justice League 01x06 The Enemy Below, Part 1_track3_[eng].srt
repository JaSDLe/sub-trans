[beeping]

2
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:27,541
Sir, unidentified craft approaching.

3
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,076
Bearing 010.

4
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:30,544
At this depth?

5
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:33,247
Establish radio contact.

6
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:38,452
I've tried all frequencies. No response.

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,321
Whatever it is, it's big and closing fast.

8
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,773
Evasive maneuvers.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,910
Planes down 20 degrees.

10
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,919
Still closing, sir. It's going to...

11
00:00:55,987 --> 00:00:57,921
[crashing]

12
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,241
Unh!

13
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,127
Damage report.

14
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,745
Starboard rudder's out.

15
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:07,047
Captain, the hostile craft is turning!

16
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:08,332
It's making another run!

17
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,302
Prepare torpedo tubes!

18
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,920
There's no time!

19
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,807
[all screaming]

20
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:18,309
<i>This is U.S.S. Defiant.</i>

21
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,811
We are under attack and have sustained heavy damage.

22
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:23,463
We are going down. Repeat, we are going down.

23
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,543
The surface dwellers' ship has been disabled.

24
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:37,861
Good.

25
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,797
Let it sink.

26
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:57,808
<i>U.S.S. Defiant,</i>

27
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,710
This is the Justice League responding.

28
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:00,878
Help is on the way.

29
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:10,520
I've locked onto their distress beacon. We're getting close.

30
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,339
We're not the only ones.

31
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,524
We've got company.

32
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:17,894
Not for long.

33
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,780
Lost 'em.

34
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,449
You were saying?

35
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,937
Those sailors won't have a prayer

36
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:45,639
If we keep playing cat and mouse. Come on.

37
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,190
Push!

38
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:39,126
Man: Halt!

39
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,447
You've violated the sovereign borders of Atlantis.

40
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,949
Leave at once, or you will be destroyed.

41
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,701
We apologize for the intrusion.

42
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:49,336
We were responding to a call for help.

43
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,740
They should have stayed on the surface where they belong.

44
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:56,393
Please. The men on board-- they'll drown.

45
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:00,780
Take the crew. But the vessel stays.

46
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:03,067
No way. That's a nuclear sub.

47
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,719
If you think we're just going to walk away and leave it--

48
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,921
What makes you think you have a choice?

49
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,176
Superman: He's right. Time's running out.

50
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:23,454
That's the last one.

51
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,359
Escort them to the surface.

52
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,222
You know, all this could have been avoided.

53
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,607
How?

54
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,194
Come and air your grievances at the world assembly.

55
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,662
Negotiate for peace.

56
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,381
You'd have me crawl to them like some beggar?

57
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,917
No. Stand before them like a king.

58
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,016
Man: I say the surface dwellers are barbarians.

59
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,552
They sail their weapons across our seas

60
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,854
And pollute our oceans with their garbage.

61
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,757
There's only one way to ensure Atlantis' safety,

62
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,059
And my troops are prepared to take action.

63
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,410
What sort of action?

64
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:38,529
We have the technology

65
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,731
To wipe them off the face of the Earth.

66
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,299
Just give the order.

67
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,734
General Brak,

68
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,536
I decide policy here, not you.

69
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:46,737
But how much longer

70
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,405
Must we endure these affronts?

71
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:50,991
Surely you realize that now is the perfect time--

72
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,177
Hold your tongue, Brak. Your king has spoken.

73
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,980
Forgive me, lord Orm.

74
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,489
General Brak, I will consider your counsel,

75
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,591
But this is a most serious matter.

76
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,527
I must give it more thought.

77
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,120
He has quite a grip.

78
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:21,888
Takes after his father.

79
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,600
Look at him.

80
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:36,302
So peaceful, so innocent.

81
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,304
Mera, what kind of future

82
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,707
Am I making for our son?

83
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:44,127
Whatever you decide,

84
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,964
I'm sure it will be the right choice.

85
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:48,732
Will it?

86
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,984
Your hands are strong and noble.

87
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:52,919
I would gladly place my fate in them.

88
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,418
I understand your concerns, admiral,

89
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,836
But lives were at stake.

90
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,271
There was nothing else we could do.

91
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,840
Green Lantern: The admiral's right.

92
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,507
We never should have left the sub down there.

93
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,310
Now it's in the hands of that madman.

94
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:17,845
Aquaman's no madman.

95
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:19,213
He's a king.

96
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,049
He only wants to preserve and protect his own kind.

97
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:24,617
So, who's going to protect us from him?

98
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,253
Whoa.

99
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,007
Hey, where'd that dude come from?

100
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:38,024
Oof! Hey, watch it!

101
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,363
Out of the way, meathead!

102
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,367
Aah!

103
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,825
Not so fast, buddy.

104
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,694
Where do you think you're going?

105
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,562
Unh! Aah!

106
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,465
Where is the world assembly?

107
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,401
Green Lantern: I knew we couldn't trust that fishman.

108
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:06,904
The sub's been stripped, and the plutonium is gone.

109
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,939
And you think Aquaman's responsible?

110
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,607
Who else, princess?

111
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,243
We've got to go back to Atlantis and get some straight answers.

112
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,712
If it's Aquaman you want,

113
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,080
He's not in Atlantis.

114
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,781
According to eyewitness accounts,

115
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,616
Aquaman then forced his way past the guards

116
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:21,885
And into a closed session of the world assembly.

117
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,304
But as to why he's here or what he wants,

118
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,506
We'll have to wait for further developments.

119
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,241
[all talking angrily]

120
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:33,347
Man: Order! Order, please!

121
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,148
First you sink a nuclear submarine,

122
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:37,351
And then you threaten us to make peace.

123
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:38,751
Who gave you the right?

124
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:41,521
I am the born ruler of Atlantis.

125
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:44,608
A country we do not even recognize.

126
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,426
These are my final terms.

127
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,428
Refuse them at your own risk.

128
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,497
But your demands are outrageous.

129
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,500
They would compromise our entire world defense and economy.

130
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,668
Your problem, not mine.

131
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,671
[all talking angrily]

132
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,859
Aquaman!

133
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,329
I offered them a chance for peace,

134
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,331
And this is their answer.

135
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,333
Please, these things take time.

136
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,136
I've wasted too much time already.

137
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,336
Wait!

138
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:17,190
Oof!

139
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:19,192
Green Lantern: A real prince charming.

140
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,461
Here he comes.

141
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:22,862
Aquaman-- what happened in there?

142
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,364
Where's the submarine?

143
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,133
Will there be further-- move aside.

144
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,112
Oh, no!

145
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,914
Watch out! Watch out!

146
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,582
No!

147
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:45,986
[groaning]

148
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,195
Reporter: And following the explosion,

149
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:57,197
Members of the Justice League rushed Aquaman

150
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:58,915
To metropolis medical center.

151
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,651
There are still no official reports on his condition,

152
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,037
But his injuries appear to be critical,

153
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,039
Possibly fatal.

154
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,408
We cannot allow this treacherous attack

155
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,959
To go unpunished.

156
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:13,146
With all due respect, lord Orm,

157
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:16,082
You're in no position to give that order. The king--

158
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,717
The king may be dead,

159
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:19,752
And the prince is still an infant.

160
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,538
But even so, the law of succession must be respected.

161
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,374
The prince will take control

162
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,708
When he comes of age,

163
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,377
But in the meantime,

164
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:29,345
This outrage must be avenged.

165
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:30,981
Mera: Orm, did you hear?

166
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,734
Oh, my poor Mera,

167
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,237
All of Atlantis mourns your loss.

168
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,539
You speak as if he'll never come back.

169
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,174
I pray he will.

170
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:43,960
But who knows what the surface dwellers may do to him?

171
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,884
Have we got a line in yet? I need it stat.

172
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:54,437
Negative. His skin's tougher than a rhino's.

173
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:00,710
His vitals are falling.

174
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:02,495
This is hopeless.

175
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,187
How bad is it?

176
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,570
Hard to tell.

177
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:13,773
His physiology is not like ours.

178
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,275
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.

179
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:16,743
But can you help him?

180
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,278
I don't know.

181
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:19,678
Then maybe I can.

182
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,234
[beeping]

183
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,304
His vitals--

184
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,022
They're stabilizing.

185
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:50,644
Maintain saline at 3.5%.

186
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,146
But how could you possibly guess that?

187
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,482
He's a fish out of water, doctor--

188
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,916
Salt water.

189
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:06,459
Superman: He's coming around.

190
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:13,315
Good. Now maybe we can get some answers.

191
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:16,085
What did you do with the plutonium?

192
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,272
Plutonium?

193
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,992
From the submarine. You stole it.

194
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,660
My orders were to leave that vessel where it lay.

195
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,763
And you expect us to believe that?

196
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,848
Believe what you want.

197
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,918
Someone tried to kill me, and I need to find out who.

198
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,790
Wait. I can help.

199
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:39,292
But you're going to have to trust me.

200
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:43,413
Reporter: Here at metropolis medical center,

201
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,149
We've just gotten word that Aquaman is about to be moved.

202
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,368
Hospital sources say he's going to an unnamed

203
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:50,870
Marine research facility for further treatment.

204
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,877
Wonder Woman: I hope this plan of yours works, Batman.

205
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:59,278
Just keep your eyes open.

206
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,246
Here he comes.

207
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,499
Doctor, can we get a statement?

208
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,034
What's the prognosis?

209
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,502
What's the condition of the patient?

210
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,285
Doctor, is he going to be ok, sir?

211
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:23,903
Please, just go on record...

212
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,940
There!

213
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,559
I see him.

214
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:34,280
[all screaming]

215
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:49,429
Aah! Ahh!

216
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,030
Unh!

217
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,021
Are you ok?

218
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,838
Perfectly.

219
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,227
Diana, he's heading towards you.

220
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:45,235
End of the road.

221
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,903
I'll take a detour.

222
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,501
What's taking so long?

223
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,002
I must return to Atlantis.

224
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,670
Sit tight, your highness.

225
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:06,305
We'll tell you when it's safe to go.

226
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,093
Unh!

227
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,278
You presume too much.

228
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,913
[grunting]

229
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:36,135
Don't move.

230
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,473
[Batman coughing]

231
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:28,788
[groans]

232
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:33,275
Ok, ok, I give up.

233
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,761
You tried to kill Aquaman. Why?

234
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,597
[sarcastically] gee. Why would a hired gun

235
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:40,599
Try to shoot somebody?

236
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,718
Could it be that someone paid me to?

237
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:44,036
Wonder Woman: Who?

238
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:50,059
Oh, come on, babe. You know I can't tell you that.

239
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:52,361
Professional ethics.

240
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,697
But then again... Heh heh!

241
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:56,583
If you make it worth my while...

242
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,384
I'll take it from here.

243
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:05,842
You can't scare me, Batman.

244
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,779
Let me give you one word of advice.

245
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,698
[Batman talking indistinctly]

246
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:16,668
Ok. I'll tell, I'll tell.

247
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:17,787
What did he say?

248
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,221
You don't want to know.

249
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:28,480
Who hired you?

250
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,067
I don't know. I don't ask questions.

251
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,485
Not good enough.

252
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:34,320
How were you paid?

253
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:36,155
In gold. See?

254
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:43,129
Spanish doubloons.

255
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:45,331
Where would they get coins like this?

256
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,633
Atlantis.

257
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,868
We've got to warn Aquaman.

258
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:51,937
Too late. That royal pain in the neck's already gone.

259
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,490
And I couldn't stop him.

260
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:55,574
Hera help him.

261
00:19:57,194 --> 00:20:00,162
[pounding]

262
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,933
My friends, now is the time for action.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,168
Now is the time for mighty Atlantis

264
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:08,004
To rise up and strike terror

265
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:09,772
Into the hearts of its enemies.

266
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,140
Are you with me?

267
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,643
[all cheering]

268
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,863
Orm!

269
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,063
What treason is this?

270
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,967
No treason, brother. I thought you were--

271
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,436
Dead?

272
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:26,138
That's no reason to plunge Atlantis into a foolhardy war.

273
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,790
I left specific orders.

274
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,177
I'm only doing what you never had the courage to do.

275
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:34,079
Enough! I'll hear no more.

276
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:35,598
Arrest the traitor.

277
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:41,920
You heard him.

278
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,991
What?!

279
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:47,827
You are the traitor.

280
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:50,212
You abandoned your people,

281
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,715
Sold them out to the surface dwellers.

282
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:54,717
Look around you, brother.

283
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,635
I'm in charge now.
