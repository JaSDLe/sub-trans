He's down.

00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,818
Well done, Copperhead.

00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:41,919
Sss.

00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:44,055
Grundy, be a dear and get the door.

00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:45,006
Ok.

Shade, cover us.

00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:37,090
We've got 3 minutes before the police respond

21
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:38,675
To the silent alarms.

22
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:39,944
Plenty of time.

23
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:59,130
At last, here it is.

24
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:01,482
Uh, what are we stealing?

25
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,684
Who cares?

26
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,085
As long as we get paid.

27
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:05,186
Let's go.

00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:17,415

Who are you?

45
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,579
I answer to no man.

46
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:23,580
Ugh!

00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:25,216

I'm leaning towards the cranberry.

00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,912
That is so definitely your color.

Don't you agree, miss?

54
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:24,268
Why would anyone want to cover up her natural beauty?

55
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,687
Easy for you to say, Ms. Cheekbones.

56
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:28,823
What about the autumn sunset?

Aah! It's the latest scent!

60

You wear this,

61
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:45,522
And you'll have to beat the men off with a stick.

62
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,525
Believe me, I don't need a stick.

Keep your shirt on, lady. I'm on a break.

Thanks.

Batman: Wonder Woman...

71
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,347
We need to talk.

72
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:33,203
Wonder Woman: An Amazon? That's ridiculous.

73
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,021
I don't think so.

74
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,839
I managed to take this off her.

75
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,727
It's an Amazon design, isn't it?

76
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,830
Yes, but it could be a forgery.

77
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:44,965
Besides, amazons don't steal.

78
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,183
It's against our code.

79
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,919
And we never leave the island.

80
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,204
Never?

81
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,782
I know it seems complex,

82
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,701
But if everyone does their job,

83
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,953
We'll crack this place wide open.

84
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,138
You still haven't said what we're stealing.

85
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,540
More chemicals?

86
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:12,293
No. Our target's the gem depository.

87
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:16,197
It holds almost $25 million in precious stones.

88
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:18,899
Gems? Count me in.

89
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,167
I like her style.

00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,586
A definite improvement over Luthor.

91
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,221
So, we're all on board?

92
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,373
Grundy don't know.

We need everybody, big man.

94
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,748
Would a little advance persuade you?

95
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,824
What about the Justice League?

00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,827
Grundy not want to fight them again.

Don't worry your pretty little head, Solomon.

See what you can turn up, and be careful.

This is a waste of time.

106
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,862
Whoever did this wouldn't dare remain on the island.

107

You may be right, but we have our orders.

My friends are robbing the gem depository.

To try and stop us.

138

00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,133
Superman!

178
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,585
[groaning]

179
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:08,631
Hey, what's wrong with the big guy?

180
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:09,765
I'm not sure.

181
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,333
I found him like this after meeting Aresia.

182
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,852
Who? One of my Amazon sisters.

183
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,455
I thought they never let them off the island?

184
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:17,022
Where is this Aresia?

185
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,690
She got away.

186
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,493
You track her down

187
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:23,095
While I take Superman back to the Watchtower.

188
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,131
An Amazon, huh?

189
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,634
So, what now? We look for clues.

190
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,570
What? Like fingerprints, matchbooks,

191
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,271
Self-addressed stamped envelopes?

192
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,906
No. Like this.

193
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:48,053
We've captured the thief, my queen.

194
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,544
I'm not a thief.

195
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,280
Then you deny that you took the gold?

196
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,949
I'm a friend of your daughter Diana.

197
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,900
What are you doing here?

198
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:03,403
I'm investigating a crime.

199
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,971
We suspect one of your Amazons may be involved.

200
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,709
This is a serious accusation.

201
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:12,394
What proof have you?

202
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:14,563
Recognize this?

203
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:22,371
Have my horse made ready immediately.

204
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:34,016
That necklace belongs to Aresia.

205
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,318
She's supposed to be here

206
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:36,719
In solitary meditation.

207
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,801
Looks like she got tired

208
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,836
Of contemplating her navel.

209
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,187
Nobody's been here in weeks.

210
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:56,589
I've feared as much.

211
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,424
So, why was she in here?

212
00:14:58,492 --> 00:14:59,641
Did she do something wrong?

213
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,394
No. It was the final step of her rebirth.

214
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:05,264
You see, Aresia was not born an Amazon.

215
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,733
She comes from man's world.

216
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,301
When she was but a child,

217
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:11,069
Her homeland became the battlefield

218
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:13,573
For a bloody and senseless war.

219
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,909
The victors were cruel

220
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:18,744
And denied even the basic humanity

221
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,312
Of their defeated foes.

222
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,322
Soon, neighbors, friends, and schoolmates were all gone.

223
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,090
[jet approaches]

224
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,985
Her family had no choice but to flee.

225
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:50,375
They eventually made their way to a refugee ship...

226
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:56,048
But even here, fate was not kind.

227
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,634
[cannon shots]

228
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:05,408
Pirates raided the ship

229
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:07,993
And stole their few meager possessions.

230
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,979
[screaming]

231
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,787
Aresia survived...

232
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:38,257
Clinging to a piece of floating wreckage.

233
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,321
Miraculously, she washed ashore here,

234
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:53,639
On Themyscira.

235
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:59,044
I found her and nursed her back to health.

236
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:05,117
Then we amazons adopted her,

237
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:07,486
Trained her...

238
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:12,574
And magically endowed her with Amazon strength.

239
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,966
I've often wondered if we did the right thing.

240
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:24,337
Still, how could we refuse?

241
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:27,456
You couldn't.

242
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,275
And now she's deserted us.

243
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,466
Maybe we'll find some answers in here.

244
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,034
[grunting]

245
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:40,619
Ah!

246
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,071
What is it?

247
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,206
Books, maps, city guides.

248
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:47,008
These things are forbidden here. Why?

249
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:49,262
We believe contact with the outside world

250
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,030
Could corrupt us.

251
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:53,382
It's sure starting to look that way.

252
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,755
J'onn: His condition continues to deteriorate.

253
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:01,390
Wonder Woman: He's practically invulnerable.

254
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,958
What could do this to him?

255
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:04,627
Unfortunately, there isn't much data

256
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:06,228
In kryptonian physiology,

257
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:08,113
But I'll do my best to help him.

258
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,614
I know you will, J’onn.

259
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,283
[beeping]

260
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:14,136
It's Green Lantern.

261
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:15,904
Maybe he and Flash have found something.

262
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,545
Diana, I need a hand.

263
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,364
What happened?

264
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,098
I don't know.

265
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,618
Flash collapsed, so, I brought him here to--

266
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:34,990
Actually, I'm not feeling all that good myself.

267
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:35,991
Ugh!

268
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,092
Lantern!

269
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,797
Not bad.

270
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:44,567
Be a dear and hand me those, would you?

271
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,257
Hey!

272
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,335
Why'd you do that?

273
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,404
Grundy not understand.

274
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:06,689
Solomon, for once,

275
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:08,524
You and I are in perfect agreement.

276
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:10,158
I want some answers.

277
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,344
We all do.

278
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,845
What is all this?

279
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:14,630
I think we have a right to know.

280
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:20,369
You're right.

281
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:23,722
It's time I showed you exactly what my plan is.

282
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,775
[gasping]

283
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,644
[coughing]

284
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:52,901
Batman: So, this Aresia is not really an Amazon.

285
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:54,669
She's an orphan.

286
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:55,904
It's hard to imagine

287
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:58,807
What that kind of trauma could do to a child.

288
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,192
Woman on radio: Emergency situation.

289
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,527
Repeat. This is air-traffic control.

290
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:05,363
All runways are full, and we've got 30 planes stacked up in the air.

291
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,082
Second woman: What's the nearest secondary airstrip?

292
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,617
I'm low on fuel.

293
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,369
Third woman: I've got sick people on board.

294
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:14,256
Please clear this channel unless absolutely necessary.

295
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,155
Woman: Unit 32 requesting backup.

296
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:35,277
Pulse is erratic. He's going into shock.

297
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:40,115
Knock down those flames

298
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:42,451
Before they hit the main line!

299
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,652
Aah!

300
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,775
It's like some kind of plague,

301
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:51,643
And half the city's got it.

302
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,862
Yes...

303
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,801
The male half.
