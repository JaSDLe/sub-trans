When Camelot fell,

Merlin was able to hide

00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,482
The philosopher stone from her.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,717
With it, she can resurrect Camelot

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,586
And place her son Mordred on the throne.

Etrigan: You fool!

Only a weak-minded simpleton

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,921
Would fall for this illusion.

17
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,856
Don't trust the Martian.

18
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,758
He's been tainted by that witch.

19
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:45,527
Le Fey: One of them must have the stone.

Blood: You let her get away, didn't you?

25
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,043
Admit it, Martian.

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,579
It's all your fault.

27
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,966
Ahh...

J'onn: Lie still.

You have a concussion and two cracked ribs.

I am truly sorry. Why?

I hesitated in battle, and it nearly cost you your life.

Perhaps Etrigan is right.

34
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,816
Perhaps I have been tainted by that sorceress.

35
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,485
I know what I experienced was a mere illusion,

36
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,320
But it felt so real.

37
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,623
The urge to embrace it was almost more than I could bear.

38
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,859
Sometimes I believe I would do anything

39
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,928
To see my loved ones again.

40

Excuse me?

48
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,322
This statue is a roman copy.

49
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,591
How do you know that?

50
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:13,725
Trust her on this one.

51
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,610
I'm guessing she posed for the original.

52
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:16,929
Oh. A model, eh?

53
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,397
I thought so.

But I'm guessing you already knew that.

58
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,991
And what's the source of your power?

59
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,159
Some kind of crystal?

00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,394
Or stone?

Let me understand this...

You possess the most powerful object in the world,

And yet all you wished for is money and women?

No!

You have the stone. Run!

I never run from a battle.

Get the stone as far away from le Fey as you can.

108
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,300
I'll handle the witch.

00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,301
Hornhead's right. Go!

110
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,635
All right,

111
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,103
But you get these people away from here.

112
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,354
Got it.

113

As far as I'm concerned, this mission's over.

So go find some other house to haunt.

148
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,505
I can sense it.

149
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:21,025
He just needs a little more coaxing.

150
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,637
Flash is right.

151
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:35,073
There's something unsettling about your friend.

152
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,293
When he stares, it's like he's looking into my very soul.

153

True. But I'd rather have him with us than against us.

00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,991
Freeze!

176
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,235
Faster!

177
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,756
Faster!

178
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:22,857
You got it.

179
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,974
Ah, uh!

180
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,942
That was a real pain in the butt.

181
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,046
Is everyone ok?

182
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,365
We're fine, but has anyone seen J’onn?

183
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,167
Spread out and search every deck.

184
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:50,334
Etrigan: Don't bother.

185
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,103
The Martian’s gone,

186
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,122
And so is the stone.

187
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:07,497
You stupid, ignorant, pathetic excuses for heroes.

188
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,299
It can't be.

189
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,618
Oh, really, your highness?

190
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:11,952
Take another look.

191
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,287
I've pursued that witch for centuries.

192
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:16,289
Yet you blindly ignored my warnings

193
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:17,758
And doomed the world.

194
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:19,026
Enough!

195
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,778
The truth hurts, doesn't it, princess?

196
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:22,813
Why don't you go straight to--

197
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,982
<i>More bad news-- the Javelin's gone.</i>

198
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,951
And J'onn's access code is still punched into the hangar controls.

199
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,653
Anymore questions?

200
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,490
<i>Wonder Woman: Watchtower to Javelin 7.</i>

201
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:34,458
<i>Come in, Javelin 7.</i>

202
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,328
J'onn, if you're there, answer.

203
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:39,480
Please, J’onn--

204
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:40,898
He's turned off the comlink.

205
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,085
He belongs to le Fey now.

206
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:45,886
We'll stop him. I promise.

207
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:48,372
Like you promised to protect the stone?

208
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,307
We'll do whatever it takes, Etrigan.

209
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,558
Are you saying you're prepared

210
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:53,060
To take out one of your own?

211
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,812
I repeat, whatever it takes.

212
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,715
Listen, isn't this kind of academic?

213
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,850
We're stranded here, remember?

214
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:01,018
Maybe not.

215
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,353
<i>Get a lock on the Javelin.</i>

216
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,712
You asked when you would receive your kingdom, my son.

217
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,825
Before the clock strikes 12,

218
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,594
Before this all-hallowed eve ends,

219
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:30,814
The world will be yours.

220
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:33,250
A castle, mother?

221
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:34,985
I must have my own castle.

222
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:36,120
And so you will.

223
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:09,035
Le Fey: Behold, here is your palace.

224
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,309
[giggling]

225
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,547
With the stone's infinite power,

226
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,966
I can make this last forever.

227
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,735
[aircraft approaching]

228
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:30,424
And now the final piece arrives.

229
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,646
Come forth, my noble knight.

230
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,304
Ding, fifth floor,

231
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:46,707
Sporting goods, hardware, evil sorceresses.

232
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:58,686
Ah!

233
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:08,228
Get out of my castle!

234
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:12,933
Whoa, the kid's got chops, too.

235
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,453
The rotten apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

236
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,458
Imbecile, that harpy has you charmed.

237
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,292
She'll never give you what you want.

238
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,995
Stand aside, demon!

239
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:39,793
She has promised to use

240
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:41,795
The stone's power to restore mars.

241
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,780
All honey and lies.

242
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:47,317
Your reward will be an eternal purgatory for you in this world.

243
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,752
I don't care.

244
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,538
This is my last chance for happiness,

245
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,908
My last chance to embrace my family.

246
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,293
You'll embrace them again...

247
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:59,947
After the worms devour your bones!

248
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:00,747
Aah!

249
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:10,207
Ohh!

250
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:12,025
I'll not be denied.

251
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,770
Yield... Or suffer my unending wrath.

252
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:26,723
Aah!

253
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:04,110
Play time's over.

254
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:05,913
Mother!

255
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,764
Unhand him!

256
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,950
Aah! Ohh!

257
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:14,788
What?

258
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,458
Aah!

259
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,045
Aah!

260
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,038
Stand and fight, blast you!

261
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:43,617
Nothing will keep me from my loved ones!

262
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,385
Especially not you!

263
00:18:57,766 --> 00:18:58,682
Aah!

264
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,780
Le Fey: The stone.

265
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:14,915
Give it to me.

266
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,375
My'ria'h: J'onn, my love, we're waiting.

267
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,232
No!

268
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,752
What have you done?

269
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,020
[gasping]

270
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,374
You could have had anything you dreamed of--

271
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,392
Your family, your whole world

272
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,578
Could have been yours again.

273
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:46,630
The price was too high.

274
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:48,798
I see that now.

275
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,767
You can no longer tempt me.

276
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:53,954
Have we lost, mother?

277
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,958
Only this battle, my son.

278
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,693
But not the war.

279
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:08,418
[moaning]

280
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,072
What'd I miss?

281
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:32,509
It's over.

282
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:34,878
My friends, I have failed you.

283
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:37,180
In my yearning for my old family,

284
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:40,017
I almost lost my new one.

285
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:43,853
Please, accept my humble apology

286
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:46,823
And my resignation from the Justice League.

287
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:49,926
Resignation?

288
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:52,195
Wait.

289
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:54,681
The demon was wrong about you Martian.

290
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:57,383
You redeemed yourself here today. Did I?

291
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,635
Yeah, who knew?

292
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:02,939
Under that goofy green skin, I guess you're human after all.

293
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,959
I only wish I had had your strength centuries ago,

294
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:07,628
But I'm still cursed

295
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,846
And must walk alone throughout eternity.

296
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:14,718
Poor man,

297
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:17,888
May he someday find the peace he seeks.
