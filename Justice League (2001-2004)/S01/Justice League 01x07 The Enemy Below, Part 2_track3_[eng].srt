We are under attack and have sustained heavy damage.

00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,495
We are going down.

00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,765
Let it sink.

00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,805
All this could have been avoided.

7
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:25,391
Come and air your grievances at the world assembly.

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,609
Negotiate for peace.

00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:29,895
Mera, what kind of future am I making for our son?

Man: First you sink a nuclear submarine,

11
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,632
And then you threaten us to make peace.

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,101
Who gave you the right?

13
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,553
I knew we couldn't trust that fishman.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,639
The sub's been stripped, and the plutonium is gone.

15
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:45,161
You tried to kill Aquaman. Why?

16
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:47,330
Spanish doubloons.

17
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,031
Where would they get coins like this?

19
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,468
Now is the time for mighty Atlantis

To rise up and strike terror

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,422

I'm only doing

24
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:02,228
What you never had the courage to do.

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,330
I'm in charge now.

For years, I've stood in your shadow

27

And watched while you led Atlantis to the brink of ruin.

28
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,517
I'll stand no more,

This is a battle we should have fought years ago,

31

Orm, they said my husband has returned.

Is it true?

I wish it were,

But it's only an unfounded rumor.

I've tried to be strong,

Don't worry, Mera.

Of placing him under my protection.

His own hand.

176
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,081
I can't believe it.

177
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,016
I told you he was a madman.

178
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,701
Is it madness to sacrifice all

179
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,086
For someone you love?

180
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,623
Can't you work any faster?

181
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,808
This is a delicate operation, my lord.

182
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,643
It can't be rushed.

183
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:44,895

185
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:50,567
Batman: Superman, a situation has developed up at the north pole.

186
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,420
Thermal readings show temperatures increasing rapidly.

187
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:54,838
If that continues,

188
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,173
The ecological effects could be catastrophic.

189
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,775
Then let's check it out.

190
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:00,661
But what about the crisis here?

191
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,129
There may be a connection.

192
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,479
What do you mean?

193
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:06,016
It's the doomsday thermal reactor.

194
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,719
We designed it to create a polar meltdown.

195
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:10,053
What?

196
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,639
I had it built as a weapon of last resort--

197
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:16,226
To protect Atlantis should the surface world ever attack.

198
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,861
But I never armed it.

199
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,529
Then Orm must have,

200
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,848
Using the plutonium from the submarine.

201
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,350
If the polar cap melts,

202
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,285
The world will sink beneath the waves.

203
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:26,820
Everything will be destroyed.

204
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,238
Orm must be stopped.

205
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:29,890
Aquaman: And he will be.

206
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,397
I'll see to it personally.

207

[barking]

208
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,385
Superman: Aquaman! Wait!

209
00:13:58,453 --> 00:13:59,920
Why do you follow?

210
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:02,940
We want to help.

211
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,357
This is my battle.

212
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,142
No one asked you to fight it.

213
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:10,447
Like it or not, we have a stake in the outcome.

214
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:11,732
We're not leaving.

215
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,416
Just stay out of my way.

216
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:34,437
Soldiers of Atlantis, attack!

217
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:47,968
Here we go again.

218
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:54,090
Superman, the glaciers are already starting to melt.

219
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,744
I know, but we've got our hands full here.

220
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,268
Aah!

221
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:10,524
Unh!

222
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:14,494
Aah!

223
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:18,114
Aah!

224
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,103
Huh?

225
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,137
Aah!

226
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,273
Unh!

227
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:54,985
For Atlantis!

228
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:13,670
I saw it,

229
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:15,539
But I still don't believe it.

230
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,208
Stay with him. We'll handle things here.

Aah!

00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:02,736
Ohh.

235
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,771
Apparently, I underestimated you, brother--

236
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,090
A mistake I won't make again.

237
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,241
Raah!

238
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:23,190
There's not much time.

239
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:24,424
If we can't shut that down,

240
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:26,259
The entire world is doomed.

241
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:29,029
Green Lantern: I suppose this is a bad time to say I told you so.

242
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:30,613
[both grunting]

243
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:36,619
It's over.

244
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,038
You're right, and you've lost.

245
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,229
Unh!

246
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:50,049
The tide is against you.

247
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:52,235
The reactor can't be shut down.

248
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,130
We're too late.

249
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:05,432
Not yet.

No good.

253
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:30,123
I'll have to go inside and manually shut it down.

254
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,041
Inside?

255
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:33,526
Your ring-- can it protect me?

256
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:35,712
We'll find out.

257
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:52,629
No! Get away from that.

258
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,800
Orm! Stop!

259
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,636
Still you defend them.

[both grunting]

Whoa!

Please, brother!

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,375
Help me!

267
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:45,281
I believe this is mine.

Hurry, Batman.

It's shutting down. You did it.

No...

Brak: And surely you must know, my lord,

Our loyalty belongs to you and you alone.

276
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:28,708
We never believed in Orm's plan, but your brother forced us.

277
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:31,927
The truth is we were only following orders.

278
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,097
Get them out of my sight.

[sighs]

280
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:38,868
I can only blame myself.

281
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:41,137
My fear of the surface dwellers blinded me

282
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,306
To those I should have feared most,

283
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,974
And it cost me dearly.

284
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:46,543
Don't be too hard on yourself.

285
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,345
Maybe we've all misjudged.

286
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,480
Perhaps.

287
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,483
All I want... All I've ever wanted...

288
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:56,018
Is peace and security for Atlantis.

289
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,324
After what's happened, it won't be easy.

290
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:04,644
I know, but some sacrifices are worth it.
