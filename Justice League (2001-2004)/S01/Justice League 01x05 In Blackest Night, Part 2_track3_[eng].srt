00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,159
Green Lantern: Stop!

3
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:14,979
You are the Green Lantern known as John Stewart?

4
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,747
I am. Your ring.

5
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:26,040
Manhunter: Welcome to Ajuris 5, John Stewart.

6
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,276
There.

7
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:30,695
That's where he is.

8
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,300
What is this, some kind of trial?

9
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:39,286
I was on my way to sell weapons on Ajuris 4.

10
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:42,790
I figured he was gonna try to stop me, but his aim was off,

11
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,358
Way off.

12
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:52,033
3 billion.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,568
That's how many were on that planet.

14
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,387
Hawkgirl: That scum's an obvious liar.

15
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:58,222
Nobody's lying.

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,540
I did it.

17
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,643
I'm guilty.

18
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:08,759
3 billion gone.

19
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,377
I can't believe it.

20
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:11,846
Neither can I.

21
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,233
I want to take a closer look at what happened.

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,451
Why? John admits he's guilty.

23
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,169
No one's disputing the facts.

24
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:21,856
Maybe I am. J'onn, I need you to come with me.

25
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:24,708
Flash, Hawkgirl, can you buy us some time in court?

26
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,612
You're asking the world's fastest man to slow things down?

27
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,913
Won't be easy.

28
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:37,921
J'onn: So what do you expect to find on this moon?

29
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,125
I don't know. There's something bothering me.

30
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:42,627
Just call it...

31
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,011
An intuition?

32
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,596
Exactly.

33
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:56,189
John Stewart, you may now question your accuser.

34
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:57,341
No questions.

35
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,259
[crowd murmuring]

36
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:02,596
None? Don't you intend to defend yourself?

37
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,865
No, I don't.

38
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,734
[murmuring continues]

39
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:12,106
Flash: I object. You call this a trial?

40
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:13,791
I say it's a joke.

41
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,844
Are you out of your mind? What do you think you're doing?

42
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:17,978
Prepare to be dazzled.

43
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,196
Remove him.

44
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,018
Listen to me.

45
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,221
With something this important, you got to hear both sides.

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,125
Flash, I told you not to get involved.

47
00:03:31,192 --> 00:03:33,360
They're railroading you, pal.

48
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,178
Hey!

49
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,263
Female judge: Wait.

50
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,265
This being may have a point.

51
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,200
We don't want any lingering doubts

52
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:42,069
About our final judgment, do we?

53
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:45,222
Of course not. But who would speak for John Stewart?

54
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,607
Don't you have any lawyers here?

55
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,877
We solved our lawyer problem a long time ago.

56
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,513
However, you could speak for him, if you wish.

57
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,048
But be aware, if you lose,

58
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:57,851
You'll share the same penalty as the accused.

59
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,554
The same penalty?

60
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,088
You mean...

61
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,707
That's crazy.

62
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,593
No, that's how we solved our lawyer problem.

63
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,877
What's your answer?

64
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:07,945
Don't do it.

65
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,480
What, you think I'm gonna sit back and watch

66
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:10,647
While you play martyr?

67
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:11,999
I'll defend him.

68
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,817
Very well. Proceed.

69
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,386
Ahem.

70
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:17,054
Right, sure.

71
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:23,994
But first I'd like to say a few words about...

72
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,229
About habeas corpus.

73
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:27,898
Yeah, habeas corpus.

74
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,901
And ipso facto and...

75
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,836
Phi beta kappa.

[crowd murmuring]

00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:43,414
Waiter. Another round.

78
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,685
Why aren't you at the trial?

79
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,955
Heh. We couldn't stand it anymore.

80
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:53,356
John Stewart’s made us all look bad.

81
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:55,926
So much for the vaunted loyalty of the Lantern Corps.

82
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:58,779
Oh, don't get so high and mighty, lady.

83
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,765
If you're smart, you'll stay away from him, too.

84
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,335
Otherwise, you'll wind up reeking of his stench yourself.

85
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,420
Cowards!

86
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,078
My friends, please!

87
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,012
No weapons! No weapons!

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,382
You think I need this mace to take you down?

Aah!

100
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:18,809
No more.

101
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,243
Hawkgirl's right.

102
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:23,079
John Stewart’s one of us.

103
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,749
And I'm going to help him.

104
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,863
Flash: Have you asked yourself,

105
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,998
Why this rush to judgment?

106
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,635
If the ring wasn't lit,

107
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:47,154
You must acquit. And furthermore--

108
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,456
Enough! You're just wasting time.

109
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:50,590
Who? Me?

110
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:52,977
Kilowog: Out of my way.

[crowd murmuring]

112
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,499
Now what?

113
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,835
Looks like we've got a surprise witness.

114
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,571
Surprise witness? He was nowhere near the crime.

115
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,657
What kind of witness can he be?

116
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,642
A big scary one.

117
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,365
See anything wrong with this picture?

118
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,900
Where do I start?

119
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,837
The loss of life, the echoes of our own pasts.

120
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:22,740
No, not up there. Down here.

121
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,140
It can't be.

122
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,576
But it is.

123
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,278
This moon is still orbiting a planet which doesn't exist.

124
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:30,014
It should have flown off into space

125
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,515
The moment the planet was destroyed.

126
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,867
But it didn't, did it?

127
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:36,504
Kilowog: And the Nethorians would have gotten me for sure

128
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,255
If it hadn't been for John Stewart.

129
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:41,041
He saved my life, and risked his own to do it.

130
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:43,810
That's the kind of guy he is.

131
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,779
Flash: Thank you, Kilowog.

132
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:47,731
John couldn't have asked for a better character witness.

133
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,015
Your turn.

134
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,935
Kilowog, can you tell me

135
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,336
Exactly what a Green Lantern does?

136
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:56,039
Oh, that's easy. We catch bad guys.

137
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:57,291
Commendable.

138
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,576
But how do you know who the bad guys are?

139
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:02,880
How? Uh, I just know.

140
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:04,164
Oh, so, you're saying

141
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,533
You use your obviously superior intellect

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,136
To routinely sort out matters of life and death?

143
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,088
I didn't say-- I mean...

144
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,823
Well, yeah. Kind of.

145
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,625
And then you and the other Green Lanterns

146
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:18,712
...enforce these decisions with those incredibly deadly rings.

147
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,465
I guess you could put it that way.

148
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:23,634
Who said you could do this?

149
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,469
Who gave you the right?

150
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:27,137
Man: We did.

[crowd murmuring]

152
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,651
J'onn, I hope you're doing better than I am.

153
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,319
All I see are craters.

154
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:45,005
Well, I have found something, but I'm not sure what.

155
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,016
Superman: Any idea what this thing does?

156
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,501
When I was a child on Mars,

157
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,670
We had small toys called Illusitrons.

158
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,672
They could project crude images

159
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,774
Over objects and even empty space.

160
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,459
And you think this is a larger version.

161
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,995
The engineering principles appear to be the same.

162
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:09,596
So, it's an illusion.

163
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,699
It would explain why this moon's orbit

164
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,366
Has remained intact.

165
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,118
But who-- aah!

166
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:30,150
The secret will stay buried with them.

167
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,485
Aah!

[beeping]

172
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:27,023
I followed him here from Ajuris 5.

173
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,093
I had to, uh, borrow

174
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,361
One of the defense forces' fighters.

175
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,246
So, he's behind all this?

176
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,648
Not exactly.

177
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,000
Manhunter: It is time, brothers,

178
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:40,103
Time to avenge 1,000 years of grievances.

179
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,338
Time to regain our power and dignity.

180
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,174
[all cheering]

181
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,613
Our plan has worked flawlessly so far.

182
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,248
We've sown dissension among the Lantern Corps

183
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:53,950
And stained their reputation forever.

184
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:56,252
But beyond that, we've succeeded

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,855
In luring the leaders of our most hated enemy

186
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:00,757
Away from their home planet of Oa.

187
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,959
Yes, they're here--

188
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,395
The Guardians.

189
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:05,980
All: Destroy them!

190
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:08,582
Destroy them all!

191
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,818
No, my brothers. Not here, not now.

192
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:14,187
Our destiny lies elsewhere.

193
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:17,841
But rest assured, the Guardians will burn,

194
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,843
For we are the Manhunters!

195
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,430
All: No man escapes the Manhunters!

196
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,037
It's true that we Guardians control

197
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:33,306
the Lantern Corps' power source.

198
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,241
But the individual Lanterns

199
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,809
have complete autonomy.

200
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:38,911
So, if one of them does something wrong,

201
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,313
It's not your fault.

202
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,315
You misunderstand.

203
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:43,950
We give them autonomy

204
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:46,185
Because we trust their experience and--

205
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,671
No other questions!

206
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,506
How much more must we hear?

207
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,742
We demand an immediate judgment!

208
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,543
I object!

209
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,261
Judges: Overruled.

210
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:57,980
Chief judge: Having heard all the facts,

211
00:11:58,048 --> 00:11:59,215
We will now consider.

212
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,818
[crowd murmuring]

213
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,623
I did everything I could.

214
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,891
I wish you hadn't.

215
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,832
That was fast.

216
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,601
Chief judge: The facts are clear.

217
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,187
John Stewart is guilty.

218
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,139
Female judge: Do you wish to make a statement

219
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,007
Before we pass sentence?

220
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,193
No.

221
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:28,494
Very well.

222
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:31,164
The sentence is termination

223
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:33,432
For you and your advocate.

224
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,631
Whoa. Time out!

225
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:51,284
I want an appeal.

226
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:54,187
Will you show some dignity for once in your life?

227
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:56,189
This isn't right. We can't just sit here.

228
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:59,009
We have to. Think of the others like us.

229
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,844
We all need to be held accountable.

230
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:03,129
We have too much power not to be.

231
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,469
Uhh! Unh!

232
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,952
Superman: Stop!

233
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,814
How dare you!

234
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,465
John's innocent!

235
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,702
That's your cue, Hawkgirl. Hope you can hear me.

236
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,937
Loud and clear.

237
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,323
[growls]

238
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,921
[crowd murmuring]

239
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:25,361
Superman: Ajuris 4 was never destroyed.

240
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,096
It's right where it always was.

241
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,698
It was all an illusion,

242
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,100
A frame-up, as they say on my planet.

243
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,201
You!

244
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:33,436
Aah!

245
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,339
Why did you do this to me? Why?!

246
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,257
For... For money.

247
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,542
Whose money?

248
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,609
The Manhunters'.

249
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,198
Come on!

250
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:47,850
G.L.!

251
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:07,820
We're too late.

252
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:09,488
We have to go back immediately.

253
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:15,578
Not so fast.

254
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:19,915
What's going on?

255
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,584
We don't have time for this.

256
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:25,288
Where are the Manhunters?

257
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:26,639
Headed back to Oa.

258
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,024
<i>Back to Oa? They've been there before?</i>

259
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,494
Yes. We created them there.

260
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:32,861
Say what?

261
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:35,665
It was before the Lantern Corps.

262
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,668
We thought robots would make good peacekeepers,

263
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:40,236
But they were flawed.

264
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:42,922
They couldn't understand the subtle gradations

265
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,557
Between good and evil.

266
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:45,975
Why didn't you decommission them?

267
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,561
We reprogrammed them for lesser duties--

268
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,362
Tracking, hunting, guarding.

269
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,197
They didn't seem to object.

270
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,367
Not out loud, anyway.

271
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,712
Don't let up, brothers! They're weakening!

272
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:48,120
They can't hide in there forever. Rip it open!

273
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,177
Rip them to--

274
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,866
They can't stop us, brothers.

275
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:01,000
No one can!

276
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:12,578
Got your back.

277
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:15,247
Look out!

278
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,275
Use the gun! The gun!

279
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:14,123
You three take the north tower.

280
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:16,075
Kilowog and I will take the south.

281
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:26,552
[roaring]

282
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,359
Aah!

283
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:58,684
Manhunter, stop!

284
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:01,587
Not till we've regained what is rightfully ours.

285
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:02,972
Yours?

286
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,158
The power that the Guardians stole from us.

287
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,364
It was never yours.

288
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,683
It was always the Guardians'.

289
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,151
And they betrayed us,

290
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:18,004
Just as they betrayed you.

291
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,157
Aah!

292
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,225
This power's our destiny.

293
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:29,047
No!

294
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,168
Aah!

295
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:36,221
Aah!

296
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:48,667
<i>Now I am the power!</i>

297
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,968
All is lost.

298
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,072
Not while I'm standing.

299
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:16,278
In brightest day, in blackest night,

300
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:19,698
No evil shall escape my sight.

[howling]

302
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:30,092
Let those who worship evil's might...

303
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,481
Beware my power--

304
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:36,966
Green Lantern's light!

305
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:42,254
No!

306
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:53,632
We chose wisely when we offered you the ring.

307
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,968
Thank you, John Stewart.

308
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:06,495
You're some fighter, lady.

309
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,281
But we already knew that, didn't we?

310
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,616
[laughter]

311
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:18,174
John, good work.

312
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:21,294
I guess we were wrong about you, John.

313
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:23,578
We should have known better.

314
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,832
Yeah, you should have.

315
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:38,009
Are you all right, John?

316
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:39,211
You believed in me,

317
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,913
Even when I didn't believe in myself.

318
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:42,832
Hey, what are friends for?

319
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:49,955
Green Lantern: Let's go home.
