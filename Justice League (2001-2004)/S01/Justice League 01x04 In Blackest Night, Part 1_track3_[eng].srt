[crowd shouting]

2
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:13,562
Order! Order!

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,197
We will have order!

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,038
Man: Silence!

5
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,310
This high tribunal is now convened.

6
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,713
Never before have so many put aside their differences

7
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,017
And come together in pursuit of a single goal.

8
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:36,552
Woman: But never before has there been

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,554
A crime so heinous, so vast,

10
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,722
That it had power to unite us

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,442
In grief and revulsion.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,278
Second man: We are gathered here today to seek justice.

13
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,456
Where is the accused?

14
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,892
Unfortunately, he's still at large.

15
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,695
Manhunters, step forward.

16
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:11,403
This is no ordinary criminal.

17
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,971
Finding him and bringing him back

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,741
Will almost certainly involve great peril.

19
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,559
Are you prepared for that?

20
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,429
No man escapes the Manhunters.

21
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:22,965
All: No man escapes the Manhunters.

22
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,868
Show us an image of the accused.

23
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:29,137
He's a native of the planet Earth.

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,559
The Green Lantern,

25
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,111
Known as John Stewart.

26
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,099
Man on TV: Johnson kicks out to Berry

27
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,435
At the top of the key. He shoots!

28
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,771
And the marauders score again!

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,939
[all cheering]

30
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,871
Come on, come on!

31
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,304
Unh!

32
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,173
[tires squeal]

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,675
Man.

34
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,426
[groaning]

35
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,484
Aah!

36
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,540
[groaning]

37
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,008
Aah!

38
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,987
Yo, a little help?

39
00:03:59,055 --> 00:03:59,771
Over here!

40
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,632
Man: Time was, you could have made that shot

41
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,000
With your eyes closed.

42
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,137
Mr. McGee?

43
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,738
You're not in my history class anymore, John.

44
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:17,939
Call me Al.

45
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,607
Guess my game's a little rusty.

46
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,477
Well, Chris can give you some pointers.

47
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:22,978
He's my grandson.

48
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,313
Grandson?

49
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,983
You've been away a long time, John.

50
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,918
Maybe too long.

51
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,782
Back on Thanagar, you were a cop, huh?

52
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,133
Detective.

53
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,818
What's it like there?

54
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,753
The same as anywhere, I suppose.

55
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,805
There are criminals, and we catch them.

56
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,640
And what about when you're not catching criminals,

57
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,658
When you're not at work?

58
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,093
What about it?

59
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,712
Well, is there a... Hawkboy?

60
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,785
I'll be doing maintenance.

61
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,026
What? Don't you ever get lonely?

62
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,061
More than you could imagine.

63
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,147
Sorry, I didn't mean to--

64
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,865
[alarm sounding]

65
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,250
It's an incursion.

66
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,511
More like an invasion.

67
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,880
I'll notify the others.

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,171
Wonder Woman is on another case.

69
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,688
Superman's dealing with an Earthquake,

70
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,690
And Batman would only say that he's busy.

71
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,759
Typical. What about G.L.?

72
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:45,961
I couldn't reach him.

73
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,892
And real short,

74
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,729
Practically shaved here, but more on top, like his.

75
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,064
The usual.

76
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,132
Aw.

77
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,634
Looks like you got your hands full.

78
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,071
He's smart, impatient, headstrong.

79
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,240
Sort of reminds me of you.

80
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,508
I hope not.

81
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,760
John, you still got friends here, man,

82
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:19,861
Real friends.

83
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,746
What's bothering you?

84
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,018
Huh?

85
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,408
What in the world?

86
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,126
What's going on?

87
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,928
Get out of the way!

88
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,697
J'onn J’onzz: Stop!

89
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,369
What do you want here?

90
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,705
John Stewart, the Green Lantern.

91
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,223
What for?

92
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,992
That's not your concern.

93
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,061
Want to bet?

94
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,097
Hah!

95
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,099
Aah!

96
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,421
Aren't you gonna thank me?

97
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,906
Down, boy.

98
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,095
Aah!

99
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,449
Grrr.

00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,990
Aah!

102
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,384
Hiya!

103
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,938
Hah!

104
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,490

Grrr.

107
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:56,190
Unh! Unh!

108
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,497
Ohh...

109
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,549
Why do I feel like a hockey puck?

110
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,558
Hawkgirl: Hah!

111
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,376
Aah!

112
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,561
Superman: Back off!

113
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,702
Aah!

114
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:31,075
[grunting]

115
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,913
We thought you were busy with an earthquake.

116
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,198
It was just a 4.0. You mind telling me what's going on here?

117
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,817
I wish I--

118
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:58,036
Aah! Aah!

119
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,947
Flash: J'onn!

120
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,457
Whoa!

121
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,725
What's with that?

122
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,026
Stay here.

123
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:26,848
Whoa! Whoa!

124
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,986
Awesome!

125
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,688
Could he do that in high school?

126
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,929
Green Lantern: Stop!

127
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,541
Better late than never.

128
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,216
You are the Green Lantern known as John Stewart?

129
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:03,918
I am.

130
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,553
Your ring.

131
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,749
John. What are you doing?

132
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,317
Stay out of this.

133
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,352
You will come with us.

134
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,147
[crowd shouting]

135
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,076
Welcome to Ajuris 5, John Stewart.

136
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,848
Don't expect your stay to be a pleasant one.

137
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:19,476
What now?

138
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:21,229
With any luck, this matter

139
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,963
Won't require our attention.

140
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,265
And if it does?

141
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,883
I don't need to tell you how much

142
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,053
We've gained because of the Corps' diversity,

143
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,672
But sometimes, it forces us

144
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,790
To make sacrifices.

145
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,763
He was the best of us.

146
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,232
That's for sure, but now...

147
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:03,571
Galius.

148
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,340
Arkkis, Kilowog,

149
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,142
Good to see you.

150
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,711
I wish I could say the same, Stewart.

151
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,713
You're a disgrace to the Corps.

152
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:15,883
Get me out of here.

153
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,037
Hey!

154
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,256
Stupid robot.

155
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,692
No. Not yet.

156
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:46,413
What's next?

157
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,549
Your trial begins soon.

158
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,501
If I'd been programmed with emotions,

159
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:53,104
I'd almost feel sorry for you.

160
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,662
I sense turmoil,

161
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:18,963
A heavy heart.

162
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,265
I could have told you that.

163
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,766
He's looking at stars.

164
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,651
But which stars?

165
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,913
There.

166
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,449
That's where he is.

167
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,696
Why would he give them his ring?

168
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,531
It still doesn't make any sense.

169
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,333
John's a strange one. That's for sure.

170
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:59,536
I'm beginning to think all you humans are.

171
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:00,538
Sorry.

172
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:01,705
It's all right.

173
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,106
I take it as a compliment.

174
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:04,608
Initiate landing procedure.

175
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,409
Oh!

176
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,921
They're not responding to our signal.

177
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,241
It's clear what they want.

178
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,010
I say we give it to them.

179
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,411
No. We're not here to start a war.

180
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,865
Flash, take the controls.

181
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,493
Huh?

182
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,843
Hah!

183
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,814
Superman: Hawkgirl!

184
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:18,983
What?

185
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,986
Oh, that.

186
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:25,655
[all grunt]

187
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,228
[screaming]

188
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,793
"Flash, take the controls."

189
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,495
Does anyone ask if I know how?

190
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:49,413
[beeping]

191
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:57,354
[gasps]

192
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,596
Well, they say any landing you walk away from is a--

193
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,454
Come on! Starter! Starter!

194
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:15,939
Which one's the starter?

195
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,481
Yah!

196
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:24,515
Yah!

197
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,135
Unh!

198
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,608
Hah! Hah!

199
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,680
Ugh!

200
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:40,698
Unh!

201
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,821
Aah!

202
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,056
Ohh.

203
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:58,498
I had everything under control, honest.

204
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:01,501
Uhh...

205
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,403
Green Lantern is close by.

206
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,838
That way.

207
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,416
There is no excuse for this horror,

208
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,818
And there can be no escape from punishment.

209
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:20,203
An example must be made.

210
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,338
[crowd exclaiming]

211
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,765
Oh, no.

212
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,933
Man: Order!

213
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,568
We will have order!

214
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:36,387
What is this, some kind of trial?

215
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,721
Apparently.

216
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:40,273
Judge: Remove the intruders immediately.

217
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,312
Aah! Aah!

218
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,197
Ugh! Oh!

219
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,934
Wait!

220
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,936
We apologize for disrupting these proceedings,

221
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:54,804
But John Stewart is our friend.

222
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,225
This is a public trial.

223
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,127
Very well.

224
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,596
You may take seats in the gallery.

225
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:04,932
But this tribunal will not tolerate

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,834
Any further outbursts.

227
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,051
Thank you, your honor.

228
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,879
Judge: Are you ready to call your first witness?

229
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:20,481
I am, my lord.

230
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,115
I call Kanjar-Ro.

231
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:24,451
[crowd murmuring]

232
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,986
Kanjar-Ro,

233
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,771
Do you agree to let us probe and display

234
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,723
Any and all memories you have?

235
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,308
I got nothing to hide.

236
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,732
State your name and profession.

237
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,035
Kanjar-Ro. I'm... A pirate.

238
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,320
A criminal?

239
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,589
Yet you come here to bear witness to another crime.

240
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:46,756
Why?

241
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,491
I may steal things,

242
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,077
But it's nothing compared to what he did.

243
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:54,231
[crowd murmuring]

244
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:07,461
Tell us about your encounter with John Stewart.

245
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,347
It all started with these blasters I...

246
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,765
Found.

247
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,016
I was on my way to sell them

248
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,302
To some rebels on Ajuris 4.

249
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,653
That's when he showed up.

250
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,692
I figured he was gonna try to stop me,

251
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,843
So... I shot first.

252
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,767
His ring tore out my engine.

253
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:40,210
Ha! But he still wasn't done with me.

254
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,379
He wanted to know if I was working with anyone.

255
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,614
I told him to turn around, see for himself.

256
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:51,905
He tried to shoot my friends,

257
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:55,008
But his beam bounced off their deflector shield

258
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,676
And shot toward Ajuris 4.

259
00:19:56,744 --> 00:19:59,479
There, it hit a volcanic fault line,

260
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,782
Starting a devastating chain reaction.

261
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:12,575
3 billion--

262
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:15,012
That's how many were on that planet.

263
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:23,169
I have no more questions.

264
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,289
This account is most disturbing.

265
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,375
We will recess 20 petacycles.

266
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,616
Now I get it.

267
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,018
You wanted to clear your name.

268
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,320
That's why you didn't put up a fight back on Earth.

269
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:42,005
I told you to stay out of this.

270
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:43,857
That scum's an obvious liar.

271
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:45,626
Give me 5 minutes alone with him.

272
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:46,944
I'll get the truth.

273
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,896
Green Lantern: Hawkgirl, Flash, all of you--

274
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,380
Listen to me.

275
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,966
Nobody's lying.

276
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,601
Do you see that?

277
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,304
I did it.

278
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,639
I'm guilty.
