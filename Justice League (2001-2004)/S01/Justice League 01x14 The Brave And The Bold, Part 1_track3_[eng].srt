What's the saying?

Mad dogs and Englishmen?

5
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:21,736
All for a good cause, my dear.

6
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,624
What's this?

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,401
Let me see.

8
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:38,736
<i>It appears to be older than the Proconsul africanus.</i>

9
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,872
This could be the greatest discovery

10
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,773
In the history of mankind.

11
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:49,664
Aah!

12
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,483
Humans!

13
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:02,777
What was that?

00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,212
Flash: So there I was, cornered.

15
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,066
Solomon Grundy thought he had the drop on me,

16
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,267
But he didn't, and you know why?

00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,395
Did I?

22
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:30,230
Anyway, so when Grundy tries to grab me, I--

Are you ok, man?

28
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,251
He's a madman!

29
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,552
Ran me right off the road!

30
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,586
Someone's got to stop him.

31
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:53,587
Right.

32
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:54,989
Later, ladies.

33
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,677
And you didn't want to give him our phone number.

34
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,817
Oops.

35
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,119
Sorry.

36
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:13,984

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,161
Uh-oh.

43
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:11,885
Lose something?

44
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,136
I was handling it.

45
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:16,557
So I see.

46
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,892
What are you doing here?

47
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,409
Responding to a police call.

48
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:23,030
Someone hijacked a load of radioactive isotopes.

49
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,848
No wonder these guys were in such a hurry.

50
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:28,852
Ohh.

51
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,754
Where am I?

52
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:33,006
You hijacked a truck and drove it off a bridge.

53
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,158
Any of this ringing a bell? What?

54
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,495
Let's see some I.D.

55
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:43,701
Professor Arthur Chin and Dr. Mark Stevens.

56
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,336
Both work at the River Bluffs research center

57
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,071
Where the isotopes were stolen.

58
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,741
And I feel guilty when I take paper clips from the Watchtower.

59
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:52,793
Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this.

Woman: I'm sorry. I can't explain their behavior.

61
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:01,168
They're both highly respected experts in their fields.

62
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,637
They certainly don't fit the profile of armed robbers.

63
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,772
To be fair, they've been under enormous pressure

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,391
To finish their current project.

65
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,010
It's possible they simply snapped under the strain.

66
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:11,978
I wish I could help you,

67
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,115
But frankly, the whole thing just seems so...

68
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:15,682
Preposterous.

69
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,817
What are they working on?

70
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,853
That's classified information.

71
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,405
Want one?

72
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,209
Hey!

73
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:31,131
If you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

74
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:36,620
Would you hurry up?

75
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,955
We're supposed to be conducting an investigation.

76
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,074
Can I help it if I have

77
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:41,575
A hyperaccelerated metabolism?

78
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,761
Besides, it's just a little snack.

Wait! I'll go-- with you.

87
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,009
Not without paying for that.

Stop him.

My insurance doesn't cover a second driver.

Now there's something you don't see every day.

There's nothing to go over. I'm innocent.

So that's not you on the tape?

152
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:38,304
No.

153
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:39,472
I mean, yes.

I mean, I don't remember.

155
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:43,576
Where did you stash the isotopes?

156
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,961
Just tell us your side.

157
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,646
I'm sure the D.A. Will understand.

158

After all, you're a hero.

159
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,733
Was a hero.

He's right.

Maybe some coffee will help you.

How do you take it?

169

Cream and 37 sugars.

00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,271
Really.

Green Lantern: Put it in a paper cup. He'll be taking it to go.

172
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,914
You actually posted bail for this lowlife?

If he were really guilty,

174
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,101
Do you think you could have held him here

175
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,303
with a pair of handcuffs?

176
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:40,450
Thanks for sticking up for me in there.

177
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:41,851
Ow!

178
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,286
What were you thinking?

179
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:44,987
I wasn't thinking anything.

180
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:45,972
Obviously.

181
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,406
Look, if I wanted the third degree,

182
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:48,608
I could have stayed in there.

183
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:50,460
Like I told 'em, I don't remember.

184
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:51,828
All right.

185
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,764
Then let's start with the last thing you do remember.

186
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,498
Let's see. After I caught the gorilla,

187
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,833
It told me that--

188
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,434
The gorilla talked to you?

189
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,053
Yeah. Right after I stopped his car.

190
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,938
I'm supposed to believe this?

191
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,458
Hey, we've both got a Martian’s phone number on our speed dial.

192
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:07,544
I think I deserve the benefit of the doubt, here.

193
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:09,746
Let's check it out.

194
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:11,064
Together this time.

195
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,410
Looks like he's still at large.

196
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:33,269
Wait. I've got something.

197
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:48,868
[roars]

198
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:56,392
Was that really necessary?

199
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,597
<i>Ok, so he can talk.</i>

200
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,315
Who are you?

201
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:03,967
My name is Solovar.

202
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,969
I'm chief of security for Gorilla City.

203
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:08,955
Gorilla City?

204
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,240
You've gotta be kidding.

205
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,009
I assure you this is no laughing matter.

206
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,176
Go on.

207
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:17,113
Safely hidden from humanity,

208
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:20,650
We apes have lived in peace for thousands of years...

209
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:30,827
Until the black day when a power-mad genius named Grodd

210
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,211
Tried to conquer our city

211
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,564
With advanced mind control technology.

212
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,138
We were able to thwart his evil plot...

213
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,994
But we couldn't prevent his escape.

214
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,763
It wasn't until later that we discovered

215
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,549
He had also stolen our city's security plans.

216
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,884
Grodd has sworn terrible revenge

217
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:14,120
On all who reside in Gorilla City.

218
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:15,538
So that's why you're here?

219
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:16,706
Yes.

220
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,559
To stop him from carrying out his threats.

221
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,795
If it's true he has a mind control device,

222
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:23,629
That could explain the isotope thefts

223
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:24,864
And your memory loss.

224
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,433
He needs those isotopes to power his devices.

225
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,517
So where is he?

226
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,509
My investigation showed

227
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:37,811
That Grodd had been carrying on

228
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,530
An e-mail correspondence with a local scientist,

229
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,365
Dr. Sarah Corwin.

230
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,117
I knew there was something weird about that lady.

231
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,118
We better call the others.

232
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,402
Why?

233
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,154
You think we can't handle one dumb old gorilla?

234
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:50,306
No offense. It'll be a piece of cake.

235
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:51,624
Wait. First you must--

236
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,476
He's very fast.

237
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,261
Yeah. What were you gonna say?

238
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,914
These headbands will protect us

239
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,015
From Grodd's ray.

240
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:02,402
We'd better catch the kid

241
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,837
Before he gets into anymore trouble.

242

How--

246
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,005
You blinked. Where's Grodd?

247
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,473
I don't know what you mean.

248
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,591
Don't play cute with me, doc.

249
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,327
Grodd, your little monkey pen pal.

250

Aah! Uhh!

That's for the banana.

I hate bananas.

253
00:17:58,943 --> 00:17:59,892
Foolish humans.

254
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,795
They're so easily deceived.

Aren't they, Doctor?

Don't move, Grodd.

Solovar, you're a fool to come here.

259

You can't control us while we're wearing these.

260

Actually, I wasn't thinking of controlling you.
