<i>J'onn J’onzz: Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,485
Where the heck are we?

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,570
J'onn: Something's obviously happened

4
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:14,521
To the time-space continuum.

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,840
You're telling us we lost World War II?

6
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:19,193
J'onn: They used it as a tunnel into the past--

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,280
And altered history to change the outcome of the war.

8
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,681
Uh! Oof! Oh!

9
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:28,902
Agh!

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,154
Wonder Woman: Why were they trying to shoot you down?

11
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,505
Word is,

12
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,623
They're planning an invasion of England.

13
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,808
And I have a way of finding out

14
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,009
When and where.

15
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,227
The name's Trevor--

16
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:38,595
Steve Trevor.

17
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:41,281
Yow!

18
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:44,184
J'onn: These new weapons the Axis has--

19
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,519
Where did they come from?

20
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,221
Trevor: Some genius named vandal savage.

21
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,440
The high command was so impressed,

22
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,124
They made him their new Führer.

23
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:54,011
Lantern!

24
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,645
I'll be ok!

25
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:56,797
Take off!

26
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:58,048
Go!

27
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,835
Dead.

00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:33,410
Soldiers: Unh!

32
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:51,695
Where's G.L.?

33
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,013
His ring went out.

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,031
He's stranded back there.

35
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:55,349
And you just left him?

36
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,550
I had no choice.

37
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,285
These men needed medical attention.

38
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:00,153
Don't you even care what happens to him?

39
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,504
Of course I do, but--

40
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,373
I'm going back.

41
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,058
Flash!

00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,631
Man: Heads up, we've got company!

43
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:18,372
Great.

44
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,483
Unh!

45
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,718
Oof!

46
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,342
Ugh!

47
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,849
Aargh!

48
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,425
Radio: Allied forces counterattacking in sector 5.

G.L.!

51
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,307
Where are you, buddy?

52
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,193
Come on, this isn't funny!

53
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:14,327
G.L.!

54

Come on, let's go!

57
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,951
Ok. This time, all bets are off.

58
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,706
Aargh!

59
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,649
Ugh!

60
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,858
Uh! Oof!

61
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,525
Friends of yours?

62
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:20,844
They are now.

63
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,856
Raaahh!

64
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:53,694
Oof!

65
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,164
Ugh!

66
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:58,982
Oof!

[cheering]

68
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,256
Thanks for the lift, angel.

69
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:13,423
I can take it from here.

70
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,159
If your mission's as important as you say,

71
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,593
I should stay and protect you.

72
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,428
What about your green friend?

73
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:19,930
J'onn has a way of blending in.

74
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,215
Yeah. Real inconspicuous.

75
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:24,200
Just like you.

76
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,204
Come on. Let's get inside.

77
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,615
Why are we here?

78
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:41,384
I'm supposed to rendezvous with a man named Ernst.

79
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,553
He's a code breaker. See this?

80
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:45,655
It's some kind of new communicator.

81
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:48,908
If we can break the code, we can listen in on the Axis high command

82
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,877
And find out when the invasion is.

83
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:52,645
So where is this code breaker?

84
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,180
He'll be here. In the meantime,

85
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's make ourselves at home.

86
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:02,155
[gunfire]

87
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,338
I couldn't find G.L. Anywhere.

88
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,489
I still can't believe

89
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,792
You left him behind.

90
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:22,842
Come with me.

91
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,149
Do you see that?

92
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:34,821
Yeah, so?

93
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,256
Look again.

94
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:38,191
The casualties would have been much worse

95
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,659
If we'd stopped to help J’onn.

96
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,162
We had to make a choice.

97
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,596
Some choice.

98
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,688
Thanks for helping us out up there.

99
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:10,089
Don't thank us.

100
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,025
We would have shot those planes down anyway.

101
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,960
I've never seen an insignia like that.

102
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,563
What country are you from?

103
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:17,964
We're not from any one country.

104
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,399
Andre's from France.

105
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:20,833
Hendricks is from Holland,

106
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:22,636
Olaf comes from Norway.

107
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,904
And I'm Blackhawk, from Poland.

108
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,124
All countries occupied by the Axis authorities.

109
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,876
We Blackhawks bow to no authority

110
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,011
Until our homelands are free again.

111
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:33,396
<i>Vive la liberté!</i>

112
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:35,832
Are these guys for real?

113
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,069
We would gladly lay down our lives for our cause.

114
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,737
But we can't win this war alone.

115
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,572
How can we help?

116
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:57,470
Oof!

117
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,111
Man: What have we here?

118
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,631
Whatever he is, he doesn't look German.

119
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:08,898
Don't let that fool you.

120
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,067
What if he's a spy?

121
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,135
Man: Back off, bulldozer.

122
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:13,303
He's no spy.

123
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,705
I saw him in action while I was out on recon.

124
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,308
You a partisan?

125
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,210
I guess you could call me that.

126
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:22,145
The name's John Stewart.

127
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,348
What's that fancy ring?

128
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,983
Some kind of secret weapon?

129
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,619
Not any more-- it's out of juice.

130
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,455
Too bad. Seeing as how we're stuck behind enemy lines,

131
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:33,856
We could have used some help.

132
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,325
I'll do whatever I can.

133
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:36,993
Forget it, Sarge.

134
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,395
He may be a hotshot flyboy,

135
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:39,996
But he ain't a real soldier.

136
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:42,749
Uh.

137
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,867
Ugh! Oh!

138
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,303
Ow! Ugh!

139
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,004
Uh! Oof...

140
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,023
Where'd you learn that move?

141
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,592
U.S. Marine corps.

142
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,461
Why, you lousy-- oof!

143
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,679
Sarge: Knock it off, bulldozer.

144
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,347
We've got a war to fight.

145
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:58,548
There's an enemy airfield

146
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,649
Around here somewhere,

147
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:00,817
And our job is to turn it

148
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:02,185
Into Swiss cheese.

149
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,053
Welcome to easy company, soldier.

150
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,596
Uh...

151
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
Who would have thought

152
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:18,768
<i>The ubermensch would be green.</i>

153
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:19,852
<i>Ubermensch?</i>

154
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:24,240
The superior man.

155
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,176
Those destined to lead the world.

156
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:27,910
<i>I thought that was your goal.</i>

157
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,213
My only desire is peace--

158
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,215
Progress, unity.

159
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,050
With you in charge, of course.

160
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:35,752
Why not?

161
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,287
Under my enlightened leadership,

162
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:38,988
I can build a new world order.

163
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,157
All this from one laptop computer?

164
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:45,779
I am from the future, the same as you.

165
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,898
I am not from the future.

166
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,366
But this is.

167
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:53,269
60 years from now, it will be a child's toy.

168
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,606
But today, it's the most powerful weapon on Earth.

169
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,824
Where did you get it?

170
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:00,327
A gift to myself.

171
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:04,914
Greetings from the future.

172
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,849
You age gracefully.

173
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,718
You have no idea.

174
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:09,986
I have finally found a way

175
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,872
To open a door into the past.

176
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,340
And through that door, I have sent you this.

177
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,743
Over the last few years I've come to realize

178
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:19,746
That World War II was the last, best opportunity

179
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,815
For me to assume full and permanent power.

180
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,683
The technology inside this device

181
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,719
Will give you a huge advantage in the war.

182
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,971
And I will also give you a second advantage--

183
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,438
Knowledge of the future.

184
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:31,357
First, the war cannot be won

185
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:33,927
If that raging lunatic continues to run things.

186
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,662
He must be pushed aside.

187
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,166
Second, the Allies will invade Normandy on June 6, 1944.

188
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:41,418
Be ready.

189
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,035
Third...

190
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,970
Well, you get the idea.

191
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,256
Knowing the future,

192
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,507
How can I not succeed?

193
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,427
I've seen your future. It doesn't work.

194
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,245
Indeed?

195
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,451
How many friends did you bring with you?

196
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,619
What are their powers?

197
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:01,020
I'll never betray them.

198
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,756
We'll see.

199
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,082
He's yours, Josef.

200
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,468
Perhaps your powers of persuasion

201
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,019
Will loosen his tongue.

202
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,122
<i>Has anyone ever held anything back from me, mein Führer?</i>

203
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:31,468
[electrical crackling]

204
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:33,386
[J’onn screaming]

205
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,028
Amazing what the nobility keeps in their cupboards.

206
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:43,196
Caviar?

207
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:45,665
How can you think of food at a time like this?

208
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,802
I hate to see expensive stuff go to waste.

209
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,620
You're a strange one, Steve Trevor.

210
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:52,922
You have no special powers,

211
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,691
Yet you're willing to risk your life here.

212
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:55,958
Aren't you afraid of dying?

213
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:58,561
Some things are worth dying for, angel.

214
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,830
Besides, if I hadn't taken this risk,

215
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:02,598
I wouldn't have met you.

216
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,850
But the war--

217
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,151
The war can wait.

218
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,937
Right now let's just enjoy the moment.

219
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:12,609
How can we?

220
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:17,530
I found this while I was making dinner--

221
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:18,698
A good year.

222
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,099
Unh!

223
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,970
It goes all the way back to the last war.

224
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,038
Huh. Ha ha.

225
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,474
Maybe you could, uh...

226
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,243
[gunshot] ugh! Get down!

227
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:51,447
You are completely surrounded.

228
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:52,515
There is no escape!

229
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,567
How did they find us?

230
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:56,852
They must have caught Ernst.

231
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,987
And he betrayed you?

232
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,488
Don't blame him, angel.

233
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:00,923
He's just a civilian.

234
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,243
This is what they want.

235
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,112
Make sure it doesn't fall into their hands.

236
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,281
What about you?

237
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:09,649
I'll create a distraction.

238
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:11,284
But--

239
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:13,936
Mmh.

240
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,740
Wish me luck.

241
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:19,191
Good luck.

242
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,448
There he is! Get him!

Ahh! Oof!

Holy Toledo.

Uh!

255
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:16,866
Where is Ernst?

[whimpering]

257
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:21,970
This one's tougher than he looks.

258
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,706
I'll need my special tools.

259
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:25,724
Make sure no one goes in until I return.

Ugh.

But I ask you-- how can you run an army this way?

267
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:56,122
The old Führer was a little crazy,

268
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:59,058
But at least he had more respect for his generals.

269
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:33,292
Welcome to Blackhawk island.

270
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:38,648
We were doing routine reconnaissance yesterday when we saw this.

271
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,152
Some kind of factory complex.

272
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,253
What are they building in there?

273
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,338
We don't know, but whatever it is,

274
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,574
They're determined to protect it at all costs.

275
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,709
It's defended by antiaircraft batteries--

276
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:52,711
Here, here, and here.

277
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,196
If you can take those out,

278
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,463
We can cripple the factory.

279
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,516
Consider it done.

280
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,125

How can this have happened?

302
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:40,418
Apparently, the prisoner overpowered

303
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:41,920
The guard and escaped.

304
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:46,291
He knows too much.

305
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,726
We'll have to move up the invasion.

306

Send out the signal immediately.

308
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,231
We can't.

309
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,566
Why not?

310
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:55,851
We just learned that

311
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,920
One of our coded communicators is missing.

312
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,889
We think the spy took it.

00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,675
Get it back, or destroy it.

Uh, yes, sir, we are already working on that.

Do you think he was telling the truth?

I can be very persuasive.

Hang on. I'll cut you loose.

You shouldn't have come here.

329

You can thank me later.

330

No, you don't understand.

331
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:14,713
Look.

332
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:26,141
It's a trap.
