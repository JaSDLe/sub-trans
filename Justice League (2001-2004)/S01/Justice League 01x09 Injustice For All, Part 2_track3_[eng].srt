This is the end of an era.

<i>The end of your era, maybe.</i>

Ack! Uhhh! Ohhh!

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,447
My tests indicate you have a rare form of blood poisoning.

6
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:24,566
It's terminal.

00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:27,819
Glad you could make it.

00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:30,555
And of course, you all know the Ultra-Humanite.

10
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:32,924
You will all be paid most handsomely

11

If you can do one simple job--

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,048

So, you're staying here.

You're the only one of us without special powers,

18

But you don't need to prove yourself.

00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,572
You're not going to leave him like this, are you?

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,773
Why?

00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,041
Hello?!

28

He's still alive.

29

And he's going to stay that way

30
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:34,913
Until I say we don't need him anymore.

31

[whispering] Don't wait. Do it now.

What?! Those restraints are pure titanium.

00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:57,469
He'll never get loose.

37
00:02:57,536 --> 00:02:58,470
And that stasis field

38
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:00,104
Will prevent the Martian from locating him.

39
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,442
Now, Batman, you must have some kind of pass key

40
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,045
Or access code I can use against your friends.

Where is it?

Bring that upstairs. I'll get it open.

Ohhh.

What's Luthor paying you for this?

Money-- lots of it.

Look at all you've had to put up with.

You should be getting more.

Just because you won't live to see old age

My research opened whole new worlds.

120

There was so much to do.

You didn't have enough for research subjects,

Ha ha ha! It's no joke!

178
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:54,002
There's a surprise hidden in your little clubhouse.

Ohhh!

00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,387
He's going to miss the show

00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,624
I'll take him to the medical bay.

And then we get paid, right?

Please, can't you let me savor this one moment?

It wasn't Batman.

It was someone saying there's a bomb up here.

Must be some kind of joke.

What's the point? It's over!

No. We can still win if we lure them here.

Grundy, and the Shade.

I saw them coming, and then everything went black.

How could they have gotten in?

250
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:25,929
Only one way--

00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,999
With Batman's transmitter.

[grunting]

347
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:57,895
Whoa!

348
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:59,846
Oof! Oh!

349
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:07,704
Enough!

350
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,972
Where's Luthor?

351
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,241
Right here!

352
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:11,325
Unh!

353
00:19:11,392 --> 00:19:14,745
And I'm going to enjoy every moment of this.

354
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:16,513
[groaning]

355
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,918
Why so surprised, Superman?

356
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,053
It's a basic rule of business--

357
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,539
Turn every weakness into a strength.

358
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,508
[Superman screaming]

359
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,112
Of course, that's a lesson

360
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,031
You may not live to appreciate.

361
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:35,983
Neither will you, Lex.

362
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,285
[screaming]

363
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:42,139
Ooh...

364
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:46,676
<i>Et tu, Humanite? Oof.</i>

365
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,362
Green Lantern: Don't move!

366
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,898
I surrender.

367
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,736
Whoopsie. Time to run!

368
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:58,956
But there's still one unfinished piece of business.

369
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,231
What?!

370
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,671
Unh!

371
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,540
Oof! Oh!

372
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:19,843
No fair!

373
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,278
How'd you get free?

374
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,763
I could have escaped anytime,

375
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:23,930
But I thought I'd stick around

376
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:25,983
To keep an eye on you clowns.

377
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:28,936
Oof! Oh...

378
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:31,488
You're despicable.

379
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,290
[sighs]

380
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,332
Wait!

381
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,000
You'll keep our bargain?

382
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,403
Yes. Double what Luthor was paying.

383
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:49,372
Flash: What was that all about?

384
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,899
[opera playing]

385
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,668
[groaning]

386
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,257
Humanite!

387
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:09,076
You'll pay for this, you turncoat!

388
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,812
Do you hear? You'll pay!

389
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:18,051
TV announcer: This program was made possible

390
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,986
By a grant from the Ultra-Humanite

391
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:22,489
And viewers like you.
