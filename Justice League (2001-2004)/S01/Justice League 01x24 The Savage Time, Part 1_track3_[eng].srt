Green Lantern: I should have enough juice to get us home,

3
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,190
But my ring's going to need some serious recharging

00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:18,492
After towing you clowns halfway across the galaxy.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,477
Hey, at least we won the battle.

Batman: Watchtower here.

8
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,803
Prepare the landing bay. We're coming in.

9
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:32,339
Just when I was starting to enjoy the peace and quiet.

10
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,892
Same old bats.

00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,941
What was that?

20
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,643
I don't know. But look!

21
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:14,699
Hey, where did the Watchtower go?

22
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,351
Batman, come in. Do you read me?

23
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:18,468
Batman!

24
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,004
J'onn J’onzz: He's gone.

25
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,723
And so is the Watchtower.

26
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,068
I don't get it.

27
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,236
There was no wreckage, no debris, Zippo.

28
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,006
How could the entire Watchtower disappear without a trace?

29
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:40,407
Perhaps we'll find an answer

30
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,127
When we locate the source of that mysterious pulse.

31
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,517
Where the heck are we?

32
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,918
Looks like we're home.

33
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,728
Wonder Woman: Metropolis.

34
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:26,680
But how?

35
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,131
Flash: Either the city fathers

36
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,634
Did some high-speed urban renewal while we were away, or--

37
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:31,635
Or what?

38
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,437
I don't know.

39
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,371
Wait.

40
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,677
This dude's picture is everywhere. Who is he?

41
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:41,962
Man: You, there!

42
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:45,449
Show me your papers.

43
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,699
What?

44
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:53,273
You heard me. Let's see your identity papers. Now!

45
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,675
Sorry, but my identity's a secret.

46
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,677
Chicks dig that whole "man of mystery" thing.

47
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,146
You think this is a joke?

48
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:00,497
You're under arrest.

49
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,332
On what charge?

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,334
Out of the way.

51
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,467
Argh!

52
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,669
Ungh! Unh! Ooh!

Ugh!

Hang on!

Whose hand is that?

70
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:31,638
Sorry.

71
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,797
This is too weird. Even for him.

72
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,184
Hey, wait up. I've got some questions.

73

[guns clocking]

74
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,328
No. I'll ask the questions.

75
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:13,830
Who are you?

76
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,465
Bats, you're starting to scare me.

77
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,767
I scare a lot of people.

78
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,103
The resistance might be able to use you,

79
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,038
But you're going to have to prove we can trust you.

80
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,423
Are you kidding?

81
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,791
You've known us for years.

82
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,679
You must have me confused with someone else.

83
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,298
I don't think he's kidding.

84
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,902
Listen, if we wanted to hurt you,

85
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,836
We would have.

86
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,381
Let's talk.

87
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,623
The storm troopers came to our house.

88
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,258
I was 8 years old.

89
00:06:58,326 --> 00:07:00,343
And they murdered your parents. Why?

90
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,545
For speaking out against the regime.

91
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,430
Incredible.

92
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:06,499
Not really. It happens every day.

93
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,168
That's why I started the resistance.

94
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:09,235
[crowd cheering, laughing]

95
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,572
We're all orphans and outsiders,

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,690
Fighting the good fight.

97
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,644
How long has this regime been in power?

98
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:18,878
Since World War II.

99
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:20,547
But we won that war, didn't we?

100
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:21,714
No.

101
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:24,550
They did.

102
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:30,590
You're telling us we lost World War II?

103
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,858
That's insane!

104
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,944
The Allies invaded Europe on D-day, and--

105
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:35,245
It was a disaster.

106
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:37,931
D-day was the beginning of the end for the Allies.

107
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,599
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

108
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,468
Something's obviously happened to the time/space continuum.

109
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,570
Probably caused by the disturbance we saw.

110
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,139
But why weren't we affected?

111
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,608
Perhaps the aura from Green Lantern's ring protected us.

112
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,876
Want to share?

113
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:51,345
Have you detected any large electrical

114
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:52,812
Or magnetic disturbances recently?

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,282
We experienced some interference on our com links.

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,216
Why?

117
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:01,455
Batman: According to my sources,

118
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,156
The pulse emanated from here--

119
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:05,241
Vandal savage's research center.

120
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:06,492
Who's vandal savage?

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,194
You're joking.

122
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,165
He's everything I've been fighting against--

123
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:15,035
The undisputed dictator of this repressive regime.

124
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:17,721
Let's see what's inside.

00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,919
How soon before it flatlines?

128
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,354
48 hours, give or take.

129
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:36,756
Just as savage predicted.

130
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:39,525
If only we could have controlled the wave fluctuations,

131
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,295
Practical time travel would be a reality.

What is that?

Heavy matter, like a black hole.

142
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,207
They used it as a tunnel into the past.

143
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,143
And altered history to change the outcome of the war.

144
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,478
Can we change it back?

145
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,712
It would be risky.

That appears to be the case.

No. If this doesn't work,

Someone's got to stay here and fight.

00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,658
Hey, colonel Klink!

175
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,713
Argh!

176
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,082
Ungh!

177
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:35,460
[rapid gunfire]

178
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,856
[grunting]

179
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,758
[struggling]

180
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,469
[straining]

181
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,117
Unh... Ungh!

182
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:19,337
Ungh!

183
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,876
[all straining]

184
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,983
[cheering]

185
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,157
I feel like road kill.

186
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:40,859
[wolf whistle]

187
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:41,794
Thanks, doll!

188
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,145
Ungh!

189
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,564
I pulled this from the control panel.

190
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,716
Transistors?

191
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,484
They weren't invented until after the war.

192
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,735
The scientists at the laboratory

193
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:52,554
Said the hole was unstable.

194
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:53,889
Whoever left from our time

195
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,457
Could have gotten here months ago,

196
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,458
Perhaps years.

197
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:57,926
So where do we start?

198
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,795
[large explosion]

199
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,406
Those troops are getting decimated.

200
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:12,908
You help them.

201
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,276
I'll fly to Berlin.

202
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:16,461
I suspect the answer to this mystery lies there.

203
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,795
Wait.

204
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:20,031
I can't let you go into enemy territory alone.

205
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,200
Go, then. We'll handle things here.

206
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,697
<i>Man: Mein Führer!</i>

207
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:37,115
<i>Mein Führer.</i>

208
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,168
This just came in from the front.

209
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:47,860
Another report about costumed fighters with magical powers.

210
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,363
Ally propaganda.

211
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,749
[men murmuring]

212
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:55,166
Man: What if it's not propaganda?

213
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:57,469
What if these super men are real?

214
00:14:57,536 --> 00:15:00,088
Are we prepared to deal with them?

215
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,274
You have a short memory, Hoffman.

216
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:03,875
You've obviously forgotten about the weapons

217
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,177
I've already created,

218
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:07,295
Weapons the Allies have never even dreamed of.

219
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:08,980
And more are coming...

220
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,048
Like this.

221
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,533
Argh!

222
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,135
[groaning]

223
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:15,553
Ungh!

224
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,856
Any other questions?

225
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:19,791
[loud crashes]

226
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:22,477
What now?

227
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,495
[sirens blaring, men yelling]

228
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,491
Halt!

229
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:37,860
Mind if I borrow this?

230
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,027
Ungh!

231
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,320
[groaning]

232
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:52,775
Stop him!

233
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,577
So long, fritz.

234
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:26,358
Ungh!

235
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,722
[coughing]

236
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:57,706
Ungh!

237
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,087
[gasps]

238
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,601
Oh...

239
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,841
An angel.

240
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:34,276
I must be in heaven.

241
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,028
You're not dead.

242
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,746
Are you a deserter or a spy?

243
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,548
I'm not sure I should tell you.

244
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,634
Well, I did just save your life.

245
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,269
Why were they trying to shoot you down?

246
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:46,170
Just between you and me:

247
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:47,505
I've got something they want.

248
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,657
Go on.

249
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,377
Word is, they're planning an invasion of England,

250
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:55,079
And I have a way of finding out when and where.

251
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:57,582
But it's not going to mean a thing unless I can get to France,

252
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,418
So if you'll excuse me...

253
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:03,922
And if you're ever stateside after this is over,

254
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,190
Look me up. The name's Trevor.

255
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,359
Steve Trevor.

256
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:12,597
Whoa!

257
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,717
Wonder Woman: It's all right.

258
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,518
He's with me.

259
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:18,487
You're sure?

260
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:23,325
These new weapons the Axis has-- where did they come from?

261
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,961
Some genius named vandal savage.

262
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:27,579
The high command was so impressed,

263
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,080
<i>They made him their new Führer.</i>

264
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:31,233
Vandal savage made these weapons?

265
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,985
Yeah. He's still got a lab over on Grundstrasse,

266
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,920
But you'll never get in. I've tried.

267
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:38,539
I have a feeling it'll be easier for me.

268
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,095
You're sure I'm not dead?

269
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:03,181
J'onn J’onzz: A laptop?

270
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,666
Man: This way. I thought I heard something.

271
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:16,194
Fascinating.

272
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,498
Argh!

273
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:20,866
[groaning]

274
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:34,729
Argh!

275
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,614
Oh... Ungh.

276
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:41,937
Ungh!

277
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:58,553
Get those soldiers out of here. I'll cover you.

278
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,940
Can't hold them much longer.

279
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:02,908
Hurry!

280
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:11,966
[straining]

281
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,709
Green Lantern: Argh! Ungh!

282
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,099
Uh!

283
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:34,272
[rapid gunfire]

284
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:41,812
Lantern!

285
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,564
I'll be ok! Take off!

286
00:20:45,134 --> 00:20:46,084
Go!

287
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:51,139
Ungh!

288
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,631
Dead.
