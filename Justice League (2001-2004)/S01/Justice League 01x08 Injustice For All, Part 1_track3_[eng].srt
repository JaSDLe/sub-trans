1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,495
Luthor: So, this is how it ends.

2
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:17,264
You know, I've carried this around for years

3
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,316
Waiting for just the right moment,

4
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:20,884
But now that it's here,

5
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,604
I almost feel a little let down.

6
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,173
Almost.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,807
Unh! Unh!

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,559
Any last requests?

9
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:32,062
Luthor, I have to know,

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,198
Those weapons you sold to the terrorists, how--

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,500
How did I get them through customs?

12
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,469
A gift here, a bribe there.

13
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:41,888
When money talks, people listen,

14
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:44,775
Like Stavros, of the shipping company.

15
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:46,527
Or Schneider, the Interpol agent

16
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,145
Who looked the other way.

17
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:49,396
Sounds like you're going

18
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:51,014
to have company in prison.

19

[gasps]

It can't be! The kryptonite!

21

Won't protect you any longer.

22
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:06,413
No!

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,031
Batman: You're usually more careful, Lex.

24
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,433
You slipped up.

25
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,268
And you're going down hard.

26
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:13,603
[gasps] ugh!

27
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,543
Mission accomplished.

28
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:21,812
J'onn: So much for your image

29
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,847
as the benevolent businessman.

30
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:25,516
This is the end of an era.

31
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,668
The end of your era, maybe.

32
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:33,039
Ugh!

33
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:33,707
Oh!

34
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,915
Why do they always run?

You!

47
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:00,770
Lex, this is dr. Patel.

48
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:01,838
He's got something to tell you.

49
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,140
<i>No. I've got something to tell you.</i>

50
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,843
Whatever I said to the Martian won't stand up in court.

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,646
I'll get the best lawyers, the best witnesses, the best--

52
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:13,266
Lex! None of that matters anymore. Listen.

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,235
Mr. Luthor, you had a seizure.

54
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:16,402
Has this happened to you before?

55
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,875
My tests indicate you have a rare form of blood poisoning.

56
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:23,192
Impossible!

57
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,561
Remember that chunk of kryptonite

58
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:26,029
You carried around for years?

59
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:29,315
What about it? Kryptonite only affects you.

60
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,035
Actually, we're finding that it can affect humans, too,

61
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,404
But only if they're exposed over a long period.

62
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:39,125
<i>This is your fault! All of it!</i>

63
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:42,361
What's the treatment? Radiation? Chemo?

64
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,297
Unfortunately, there is no cure.

65
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:47,667
Then find one! Price is no object.

66
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:48,835
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,737
There's nothing I can do.

68
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:51,905
It's terminal.

69
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,526
Happy, Superman?

70
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,795
Lex, if there's anything I can do...

71
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,780
You've done more than enough.

Uh! Aah!

Hey, keep it down! Can't a body die in peace around here?

78
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,353
Exquisite.

79
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:43,756
Humanite!

80
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,925
How can you stand that caterwauling?

81
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,945
Music is one of the meager pleasures I'm allowed in here,

82
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:51,864
Along with a few other necessities.

83
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:53,867
You should try the culture channel.

84
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,735
It might improve your disposition.

85
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:57,820
There's nothing wrong with my disposition

86
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,656
That a little freedom wouldn't cure.

87
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:01,658
That's not what I hear.

88
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,793
I need your help,

89
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,912
And I can make it worth your while.

90
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,397
What do I need with money?

91
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,165
Everyone needs money.

92
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,901
The only question is-- how much?

I'm afraid I'm a little under the weather.

Could you please wheel it in here?

[chuckles]

177
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:06,689
Common criminals.

178
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:09,325
Is this what I've been reduced to?

179
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:11,928
Luthor: Criminals, yes, but common,

180
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,830
Most certainly not.

181
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,798
Lex Luthor?

182
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:18,300
Well, the plot thins.

183
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:27,176
Cheetah, Sapphire, Grundy, glad you could make it.

184
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:29,846
And, of course, you all know the Ultra-Humanite.

185
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,380
Charmed, I'm sure.

186
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:32,949
Copperhead: Cut the courtesies, Luthor.

187
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:33,916
What do you want?

188
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,601
Each of you is the best in the world

189
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,836
At what you do, and I have need

190
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,705
Of your unique services.

191
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,490
My talents don't come cheaply.

192
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:44,127
You'll all be paid most handsomely

193
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:47,697
If you can do one simple job.

194
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:49,381
What kind of job?

195
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,585
Destroy Superman and the Justice League.

196
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,191
Ha.

197
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,500
...And I had those flames out before the firemen

198
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,235
Even stepped off their trucks.

199
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,387
That's fast.

200
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:13,722
Fastest man alive.

201
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:15,991
Which might explain why you can't get a date.

202
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,426
Yeah. Hey!

203
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,761
What's that supposed to mean?

204
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,046
Quiet.

Man: ...A dangerous hostage situation

Developing at the federal building.

207
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:28,020
So far, the Ultra-Humanite has refused

208
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,488
To speak with negotiators.

209
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:32,390
A freak of science, the Humanite is reportedly a genius

210
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,025
Who is also extremely dangerous--

211
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,293
No biggie, right?

212
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,089
Humanite! Let a hostage go,

213
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:48,990
And I'll give you one of my men in return.

214
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,359
What do you take me for,

215
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,594
A troglodyte? No deal!

216
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,681
What?

217
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,315
Drop the weapon, Magilla!

218
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:00,536
Oof!

219
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:04,406
Look for other hostages!

220
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:05,423
Right!

221
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:07,842
Unh!

222
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,764
You're safe now.

But you're not! [growls] unh!

I'm sure.

Don't worry about me. Stop them!

Let me get us out of here.

It's either that or prison again.

They're gone.

Look, we've still got one of them.

300
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:43,858
But they got one of us.

Welcome back.

304
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,642
We were afraid we'd lost you.

306
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:03,879
What happened?

307
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:06,381
They got away, all but Copperhead.

308
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,233
I'm headed down to Striker's to interrogate him.

309
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,034
All right. Let's go.

00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:11,670
No. You're staying here.

311
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:12,988
That venom almost killed you.

312
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:14,356
So?

313
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:15,607
So, you're staying here.

314
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:32,908
You really should be resting.

You're the only one of us without special powers,

318
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,702
But you don't need to prove yourself.

319
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,721
You're a valued member of this team,

No.

What was I thinking?

We did everything we could.

00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:04,722
Did you?

328
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:07,042
Did you fight like your lives depended on it?

329
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:08,543
Did you fight to the last man?

330

You get what you pay for, Luthor.

Are you saying you want more money?

You want to be rewarded for failure?

I ought to take the whole lot of you and-- unh!

And what?

335
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:23,858
Go ahead, do it. You'll be saving me

336
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,411
From months of bedpans and feeding tubes,

337
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,595
And you'll also guarantee

338
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:30,131
That none of you will ever see a penny from me.

And what's wrong with that?

00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:38,991
It's done wonders for me.

343
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,792
Get out of here.

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,995
Oh, Lexie, I'm hurt!

345
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:44,429
How could you have this little party

346
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:45,998
Without inviting me?

347
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,899
It's not a party.

00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,001
Grundy, get rid of him.

00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,336

351
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,840
Oof!

352
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:58,176
But seriously, Lex, you need me.

353
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,512
Like I need skin rash.

354
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,847
Maybe so,

355
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,998
But I know something you don't know.

356
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,918
I know how the bat thinks.

357
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,546
How long we wait here?

358
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,715
Patience, Grundy, patience.

359
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,717
Grundy not like waiting.

360
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,236
Unh!

361
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:44,873
Oof!

362
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,158
[groans]

363
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,366
Ha ha ha!

364
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:58,803
Ha ha ha ha ha!
