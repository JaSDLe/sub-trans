<i>Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:11,208
Superman, get away from there before it--

3
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:12,710
Green Lantern: How could this happen?

4
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:15,012
You were supposed to be monitoring the situation.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,881
Do you want to stand here pointing fingers,

6
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:18,516
Or do you want to do something about it?

7
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,818
I heard something about a kryptonian.

8
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,920
He was being taken to War World.

9
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:24,221
War World?

10
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:27,524
Nasty place. Heavy into carnage for the masses.

11
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,326
Take us to this War World.

12
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:32,229
[crowd chanting "Draaga!"]

13
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:34,198
Save your cheers.

14
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:36,634
Draaga fights for honor

15
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:41,071
And for our leader the great Mongul.

16
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,440
Still weak.

17
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:46,176
Something in the atmosphere is sapping my strength.

18
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:48,412
Uhh!

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,080
I won't leave without you.

20
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:52,616
You've got a better chance of helping me out there. Now go!

21
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:55,319
The kryptonian-- he tried to escape.

22
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:57,054
Give him to Draaga.

23
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:58,889
Urgh!

24
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,358
Uhh!

25
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:02,893
Aah!

26
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:05,662
Give me an honorable death...

27
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,633
Here on the battlefield.

28
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:12,136
I order you to finish him.

29
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:13,537
No.

30
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:15,906
Then destroy him!

31
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:16,974
No!

32
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,306
[groaning, then screaming]

33
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:32,315
No, the kryptonian won.

34
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:34,751
Don't you want to see him fight again?

35
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:36,920
I gotta admit, he's a real champ.

36
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:40,056
He's more than that. He's a Superman!

37
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:41,959
Aah!

38
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:49,299
What? Still alive?

39
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:53,837
You're tougher than I thought, kryptonian,

40
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:56,673
But I doubt you'll survive another blast.

41
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,475
Take your best shot.

42
00:02:58,543 --> 00:02:59,610
Guards!

43
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:05,415
Superman! Superman!

44
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:08,351
Superman! Superman!

[crowd chanting "Superman!"]

46
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,961
Are they mad?

47
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:22,031
If you execute him now, it might not go over too well.

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,466
Fine.

49
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:26,637
The people have spoken.

50
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,421
[groaning]

51
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,931
What's this?

52
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,733
You defied Mongul.

53
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,134
It was great.

54
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:00,270
Hasn't anyone ever stood up to him before?

55
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:03,974
Draaga tried once, but then he decided he liked living.

56
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,910
After what you did, you deserve to live, too,

57
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,812
So we've arranged an escape.

58
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,613
There's this garbage scow, see?

59
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,782
It'll take you off planet and then--

60
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,151
Wait. I can't go.

61
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,987
[all murmuring]

62
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:18,755
I won't leave without my friend J’onn.

63
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,258
If you stay, Mongul will kill you.

64
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:22,993
I've dealt with others like him.

65
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,061
I'll take my chances.

66
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:29,266
I don't know if he's brave or just plain crazy.

67
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,533
Come on.

68
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,781
Where are you taking him?

69
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,783
Where the weak and defeated always go--

70
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,352
The pit. Don't.

71
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:49,619
But if you spare him,

72
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,521
He'll never rest till he's evened the score.

73
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,693
Do you think he'll fit on that garbage scow?

74
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,928
Definitely crazy.

75
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:06,703
Hawkgirl: Ow! Get off my wing!

76
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:07,871
Sorry.

77
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,773
Why do we have to ride in this rust bucket?

78
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,074
What's wrong with your ring?

79
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:12,742
Lady, the galaxy's a big place.

80
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,712
I need my navicomputer to find War World.

81
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,113
He's got a point.

82
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,648
Great, take his side.

83
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,917
I'm not taking his side. I'm just saying--

84
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:23,053
I'm wrong again.

85
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,656
Uh, do you two want a little privacy?

86
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,991
What exactly is your problem, anyway?

87
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,426
Your attitude, girl.

88
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:31,995
Is everyone on Thanagar as thickheaded as you?

89
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,129
Thickheaded?!

90
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,832
Why, you self-righteous, green-eyed...

91
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,033
Ohh!

92
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,401
My attitude is just fine,

93
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,004
Except when you're involved.

94
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,974
And another thing-- just 'cause you've got that fancy ring

95
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,509
Doesn't make you a real--

96
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:47,778
[both coughing]

97
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:53,116
Urr!

98
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,722
Heh heh!

99
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:21,778
What? No!

100
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,660
Aah!

101
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,669
Dump me like so much garbage, will you?

102
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:54,745
But I won't forget you, Superman,

103
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:57,080
Or the shame of my defeat.

104
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:59,015
[screaming]

105
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,895
You there-- stop that!

[crowd chanting "Superman!"]

107
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,950
Listen to them.

108
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:36,186
Why do they flock to him? Why?

109
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:38,488
Because the kryptonian is so powerful,

110
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:39,890
He doesn't fear anyone--

111
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:42,192
Not even you.

112
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,061
Then we must teach him fear.

113
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:53,403
Ohh.

114
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:56,639
Lantern?

115
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:58,308
Over here.

116
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,710
Looks like we got taken for a ride.

117
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:03,346
I knew we shouldn't trust that freak.

118
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,981
Any idea where we are?

119
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,549
Not a clue.

120
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:08,118
Great.

121
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,488
So we don't know where we are,

122
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,123
We don't know where War World is,

123
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,158
And we don't even know how to get back to Earth.

124
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,093
How much worse can it get?

125
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,730
My ring could get us off this planet,

126
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:22,699
But without knowing exactly where we are,

127
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,200
We take the risk it'll run out of power

128
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:26,369
Before we find another habitable world.

129
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,471
So we're stuck here. Is that what you're saying?

130
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,406
Maybe forever.

131
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,409
Just the two of us?

132
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,480
Oh.

133
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,229
Look, maybe I shouldn't have been so hard on you.

134
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,330
I--

135
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:54,297
Lights!

136
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:10,747
What a dump.

137
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:11,914
I've seen worse.

138
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:13,350
I'll bet.

139
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,623
[sniffs] ugh.

140
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,263
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

141
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,463
No stealing!

142
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:29,065
Arr!

143
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,233
That's mine!

144
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,434
Aah!

145
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,203
We don't want trouble.

146
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,337
Liar!

147
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,141
Aah! Uhh!

148
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,891
No one touches our stuff.

149
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:02,966
Hiya!

150
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,901
Green Lantern: No!

151
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,307
I'm asking nicely.

152
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,977
How do we find War World?

153
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,645
Draaga: You want to find War World?

154
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,485
Talk to me.

155
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:42,871
We're almost there.

156
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,108
Draaga, that scar on your chest...

157
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:47,610
What about it?

158
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,145
I was just wondering.

159
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:51,113
Our friend wears something just like it.

160
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,281
There it is!

161
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,534
It's a big place.

162
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,135
How will we ever find them?

163
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:14,569
Draaga: That's your problem.

164
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,342
Hey! Are you nuts?

165
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:35,190
Draaga!

166
00:11:35,258 --> 00:11:36,359
Forget him.

167
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,494
J'onn and Superman are more important.

168
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:41,530
The people want fights. That's what I give them.

169
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:45,300
You're just giving them a cheap substitute for what they really need,

170
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:48,904
Like food, housing, and medicine.

171
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:51,306
No one talks to me that way.

172
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:54,343
No? That wasn't your name they were chanting out there.

173
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,044
It was mine.

174
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,846
Someone else once said that to me.

175
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:59,615
It was Draaga.

176
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,016
The mob loved him,

177
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,818
And he wanted to change things, too,

178
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:06,555
But I convinced him the old ways were best.

179
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,223
How? Show him.

180
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,733
Its power can decimate a planet.

181
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,768
And that's exactly what I would have done to Draaga's

182
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,137
If he hadn't cooperated.

183
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:25,207
I can do the same to your world.

184
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,377
You're too late. Krypton's already gone.

185
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:32,047
No matter. Any planet will do...

186
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:33,482
Even Draaga’s.

187
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:35,851
You can't. Oh, really?

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,322
Now listen, and listen carefully.

189
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,558
If you want that planet spared,

190
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,427
You're going to have one last fight--

191
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:47,830
Against me...

192
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,766
And you're going to lose badly.

193
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,167
Understand?

194
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:57,039
I thought so.

195
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:07,949
Announcer: Today, the fight of the millennium;

196
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:09,785
History in the making;

197
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:13,489
Superman versus the great Mongul himself.

198
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,349
Remember, a planet's life depends on you.

199
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,784
I remember.

200
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:52,460
What are you doing?

201
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:53,929
Making it convincing.

202
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:27,863
All of you hurry. We must be ready to fire.

203
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,706
Didn't you hear me?

204
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:41,043
His royal pain could send the order at any minute.

205
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:46,515
My lord! B-b-but I thought you were...

206
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,583
My plans changed.

207
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:51,654
Decommission this weapon immediately.

208
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:53,856
Decommission it? But--

209
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:57,025
Or do you think I'm being a royal pain?

210
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:59,194
No, sire. Of course not.

211
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,196
Good. Then do it before I--

212
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:02,464
Uhh...

213
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:03,699
Are you all right?

214
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:09,805
What?! Get him!

215
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,546
[crowd gasping]

216
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:54,716
Uhh! [crash]

217
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:03,358
Time to settle our score.

218
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:06,662
Wait! Uhh!

219
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,098
If I let Mongul finish you,

220
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,301
How will I ever regain my honor?

221
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:13,735
Listen to me.

222
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:25,414
You have to stay out of this.

223
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,582
I can't do that.

224
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:33,956
You have to,

225
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,691
Or he'll destroy your planet.

226
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,091
What?

227
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,560
Don't you see?

228
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:40,896
I promised to lose.

229
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:44,032
You'd sacrifice your own life for my planet?

230
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,633
It doesn't make sense.

231
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,139
Aah!

232
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:55,243
Mongul: Now, kryptonian, it's just you and me.

233
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,507
Haaa!

234
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:26,741
You ok?

235
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:47,696
The cannon!

236
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,768
Haaa!

237
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,645
[alarm sounding]

238
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,517
Green Lantern: Let's move!

239
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,146
[crowd murmuring]

240
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:44,552
Hear what they think of their new hero now?

241
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,827
Game over.

242
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:54,429
Green Lantern: Not yet.

243
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:56,898
We're going into overtime.

244
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:03,104
We destroyed his death ray.

245
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,673
Draaga's world is safe.

246
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,110
Then all bets are off.

247
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:11,646
You're mine.

248
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:13,715
Draaga: No, he's mine!

249
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,562
You'll regret that, Draaga.

250
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,864
Uhh!

251
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,984
Keep your guard up on the left.

252
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,159
[crowd chanting "Draaga!"]

253
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:03,765
This is for my people!

254
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,105
And this is for my humiliation!

255
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:15,343
And this is for justice!

256
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:19,114
Ohh...

257
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,688
Go, Draaga!

258
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,823
[crowd chanting "finish him!"]

259
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:37,199
No. He doesn't deserve the honor.

260
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:41,203
Then it's over.

261
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:43,038
Not yet.

262
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:51,580
Here. You should wear Mongul's crown.

263
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,649
Keep it. You've earned a chance for a whole new life.

264
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,919
What's life without honor?

265
00:20:57,986 --> 00:20:59,787
I'm not worthy.

266
00:20:59,855 --> 00:21:01,890
Draaga, the real test of honor

267
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,359
Isn't how you die. It's how you live.
