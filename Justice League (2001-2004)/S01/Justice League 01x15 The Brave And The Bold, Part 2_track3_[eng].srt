<i>Previously on Justice League...</i>

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,664
You hijacked a truck and drove it off a bridge.

3
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:14,983
Any of this ringing a bell?

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,417
What?

5
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:18,436
It's possible they simply snapped under the strain.

6
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,224
My name is Solovar.

7
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,459
I'm chief of security for Gorilla City.

8
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,979
Safely hidden from humanity,

9
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:31,182
We apes have lived in peace for thousands of years

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,483
Until the black day

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,003
When a power-mad genius named Grodd

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,123
Tried to conquer our city with advanced mind-control technology.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,445
Grodd has sworn terrible revenge on all who reside in Gorilla City.

14
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:46,113
Where's Grodd, your little monkey pen pal?

15
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,466
Aah! Uhh!

16
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:49,567
Don't move, Grodd.

17
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,086
You can't control us while we're wearing these.

18
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:55,055
Actually, I wasn't thinking of controlling you.

19
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,324
I hate to do this.

20
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:57,658
Uhh!

21
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,343
My apologies for the hasty exit,

22
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,979
But I have a city to destroy.

23
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:03,263
Aah!

24
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:19,907
J'onn: Diana! Hawkgirl!

25
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,593
What is it, J’onn?

26
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:23,727
Central City-- it's gone.

27
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:24,979
That's impossible.

28
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,781
See for yourself.

29
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,650
Sensors indicate that the city has vanished without a trace.

30
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:31,636
Weren't G.L. and Flash down there?

31
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:34,522
Flash, Green Lantern, this is the Watchtower calling.

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,323
Please come in.

33

[static]

34
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,979
Repeat, come in.

[groaning]

36
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,688
We're still here.

37
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,357
So it would seem.

38
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,843
The mind control. Is he still--

39
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,011
No.

40
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,297
This should protect him.

41
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,501
Who, what, where?!

42
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,458
Aw, man, not again.

43
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,526
What did I miss?

44
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:15,446
That dumb ol' gorilla got away.

45
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:16,948
Go ahead, rub it in.

46
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,716
This time, we're getting some backup.

47
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,618
Green Lantern to Watchtower.

48
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:23,071
Watchtower, come in.

49
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,672
My comm link's off-line.

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,008
Mine too.

51
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,826
Solovar: And for good reason.

52
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:39,120
Man, what is that?

53
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:41,789
It's just like the shield that protects my city.

54
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,057
Nothing can get in.

55
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,060
Or out, unless I can shut down the generator.

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,811
Whoa, not even a scratch.

57
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,280
Gorilla technology is highly advanced.

58
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,432
Come. We must find Grodd.

59
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,024
Approaching Central City.

60
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,108
Or at least where it used to be.

61
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,426
See anything yet?

62
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:20,394
Negative.

63
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:22,196
It's as if it never existed.

64
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,730
Proximity alert, 12 o'clock.

65
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:24,915
I see nothing.

66
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,000
Batman designed this ship.

67
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:27,902
If its sensors say something is there--

68
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,036
[crash]

69
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:30,537
Great Hera!

70
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:37,411
Hang on!

71
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,533
Your trust in Batman's engineering skills was well placed.

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,934
So what did we hit?

73
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,241
Some sort of energy field.

74
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,326
Can you phase through it?

75
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:16,183
It seems to be an asynchronous dimensional interface.

76
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,885
Let me take a whack at it.

77
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,519
No, don't! Haa!

78
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:20,655
Aah!

79
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,075
Perhaps we should try a different approach.

80
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:35,285
Weird. Am I the only one creeped out here?

81
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:36,754
Where is everyone?

82
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,156
Perhaps the shield frightened them.

83
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:41,125
Could be, but usually when a city looks this empty,

84
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:42,693
Flesh-eating zombies are involved.

85
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,294
You watch too many movies.

86
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:47,615
Shh! Listen.

87
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:49,583
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

88
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:56,524
Maybe you don't watch enough.

[crowd chanting "Grodd!"]

90
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:18,095
We're too late.

91
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:19,980
They're already under his control.

92
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:24,068
Uh, how many of these headbands you got left?

93
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:25,586
Two.

94
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,188
That's not gonna be enough.

95
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,641
Diana, I've analyzed the data you sent.

96
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,793
Can you tell us how to penetrate the force field?

97
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,529
Not yet, but I've discovered something else--

98
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:37,181
A second energy signature

99
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:39,249
Similar to the one you've encountered,

100
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,751
Except it's in Africa.

101
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,403
Africa?

102
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,104
Could the city have been transported there?

103
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:46,691
Unlikely, but it's worth investigating.

104
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:49,544
I'm sending coordinates to your onboard G.P.S.

105
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,828
I'll rendezvous with you there.

106
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:53,464
[crowd chanting "Grodd!"]

107
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:00,804
Grodd: People of Central City,

108
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:04,675
The age of hairless, simple-minded humanity is over.

109
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,328
Today a new age dawns.

110
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:10,297
Today Grodd rules.

111
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:18,539
Humans are slow, ugly, immoral,

112
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,608
And have an unpleasant body odor.

113
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,894
Hey, who you calling slow?

114
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,895
Flash, don't heckle the supervillain.

115
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,313
We don't have to listen to this.

116
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:29,083
Humans are inferior creatures,

117
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,886
Fit only to serve at my whim.

118
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:34,605
But after Gorilla City falls,

119
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,690
You will be the paving stones

120
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,059
On which I will build my new empire.

121
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,747
Hey, monkey boy, why don't you go climb a skyscraper?

122
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:45,332

Ow! That's gratitude for you.

Ohh!

136
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:53,600
Would you excuse me?

[electronic whine]

138
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,489
I'd bail if I were you.

00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,747
Where's Grodd?

140
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,767
There's no question.

141
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,737
This energy field is identical to the one in Central City.

142
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,122
Great. We couldn't get through that one, either.

143

Hawkgirl: Perhaps if we--

145
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,578
Aah!

146
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,076
They are awake, sir.

147
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,766
Where are we? Who's in charge?

148
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,084
You misunderstand the situation, intruder.

149
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,953
<i>You will answer my questions.</i>

150
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,606
Sure. Just get us out of these things.

151
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,475
It is not my policy

152
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,411
To allow spies to roam free.

153
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:11,929
J'onn: We are not spies,

154
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,997
Nor will you hold us against our will.

155
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:15,582
We-- aarr!

156
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,302
J'onn!

157
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,203
You will find Gorilla City much more difficult to leave

158
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,688
Than it was to enter.

159
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,740
Gorilla City?

160
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:26,126
Now, let us begin again.

161
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:28,912
Who sent you?

162
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,375
Halt! Who goes there?

163
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:45,312
Your lord and master.

164
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,499
Would you be so kind as to direct me to the missile control room?

165
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,100
As you wish, lord Grodd.

166
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,496
Launch codes accepted.

167
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,748
The nuclear missiles are at your command.

168
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:07,367
Excellent. Enter these targeting coordinates.

169
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,357
Targets locked.

170
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,958
Confirming Gorilla City.

171
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,260
All systems are go.

172
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,778
Commence firing sequence.

173
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,724
Flash, I can't hold them off much longer.

174
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,892
How much do you weigh?

175
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,376
About 400 of your pounds.

176
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,429
Why do you-- aah!

177
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:43,804
Ahh! Oh! 400 pounds, huh?

178
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,538
You sure you did the math right?

179
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,023
Green Lantern: Grodd got away again,

180
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,725
But if he used his rocket bike,

181
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,260
My ring can follow his trail.

182
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,763
I've gotta get me one of those.

183
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,554
Green Lantern: He must be inside.

184
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,439
Halt, in the name of Grodd!

185
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:08,461
Hurry, before Grodd finds out we're here.

186
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,797
[alarm sounding]

187
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:12,015
Something tells me he already knows.

188
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,584
No, that's a launch alert!

189
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,308
I'll go after the missiles.

190
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,144
You stop Grodd!

191
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,579
Right.

192
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,881
Stop Grodd? How?

193
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,596
Unh!

194
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:45,498
Quit stalling, spy. Tell me who sent you!

195
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,167
No one sent us.

196
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,285
Lies!

197
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,288
I want the truth,

198
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:52,823
Or you'll all pay most dearly!

199
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,858
I'll give you one last chance,

200
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:56,276
Starting with you.

201
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:58,112
Take your best shot.

202
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,813
Grrr! No!

203
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,567
Get him!

204
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:24,254
Oof!

205
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,374
Let's go.

206
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,059
Haaa!

207
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,284
Security, stop them!

208
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:56,553
What madness is this?

209
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,655
Let's not wait around to find out.

210
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,979
Aah! Aah!

211
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,291
Try to escape like that again,

212
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,541
And I promise you will regret it.

213
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:23,847
What?

214
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,268
The shield wall-- it's shutting down!

215
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,503
Get it back up immediately!

216
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,239
It's not responding.

217
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,941
Someone's overridden the system.

218
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,408
Grodd.

219
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,660
Sir, defense scans have detected

220
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,229
Armed missiles heading this way.

221
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,430
What are your orders?

222
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:41,965
Evacuate the city immediately!

223
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:44,317
But what about the humans?

224
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,869
I've got bigger problems now.

225
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,570
Wonder Woman: Maybe we can help.

226
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,789
You?

227
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:51,541
What could you possibly do to save us?

228
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:52,726
Just watch.

229
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,919
That's one down.

230
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,292
Missile number 1 deactivated.

231
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,643
What happened?

232
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:27,844
Flash: Best guess?

233
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,329
It was my buddy with the power ring.

234
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,531
You again!

235
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:34,718
Grodd, you're under arrest for crimes against Gorilla City.

236
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,971
In 5 more minutes, there won't be a Gorilla City.

237
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,181
Come on, come on.

238
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,290
Uhh!

239
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,453
Missile number 2 deactivated.

240
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,072
It's over, Grodd.

241
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,874
No!

242
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:17,293
I won't lose to the likes of you!

243
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:18,645
Guess who?

244
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,480
What?

245
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:23,016
Where are you, human?

246
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,551
You want a piece of me, chuckles? Come on.

247
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,055
Raah!

248
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,767
Uhh... Whoa!

249
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,609
No. I'm too late!

250
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:07,711
Haaa!

251
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,284
Haaa!

252
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,205
[gorillas screaming]

253
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:20,457
It's coming this way!

254
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:21,941
There's nowhere to hide!

255
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,000
[grunting]

256
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,076
Hera, give me strength!

257
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,764
Diana!

258
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,850
Wonder Woman: The fates were kind today.

259
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,035
Your city is safe.

260
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,612
Missile number 4 deactivated.

261
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,848
I'll rend you limb from limb!

262
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,317
Unh! Oof!

263
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,401
Gotta catch me first.

264
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,276
Stand still and fight me, you simpleton!

265
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:21,428
We could do that.

266
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,562
Tell you what.

267
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,197
You ditch the mind control helmet,

268
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,665
And I'll ditch the headband.

269
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,933
Flash, don't!

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,568
Come on, gorilla my dreams.

271
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,086
Take off the helmet!

272
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,546
Heh! You're a bigger fool than I thought.

273
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,165
Oh, yeah? Well, you're... naked.

274
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,555
The world will miss your sparkling intellect.

275
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,907
Good-bye, Flash.

276
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,125
Aargh!

277
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,915
What have you done to him?

278
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,652
Simple. When I pushed the helmet down over his eyes,

279
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,887
I also crossed some wires.

280
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,455
How could you?

281
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,757
You've destroyed the greatest mind on Earth.

282
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:08,992
You'll be ok,

283
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,594
Now that you're free from his mind control.

284
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:13,079
What are you talking about?

285
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:15,147
He never used that on me.

286
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,250
I loved him.

287
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:20,003
Internet romances, huh?

288
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:21,488
Go figure.

289
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:26,142
I'm sorry we misjudged you.

290
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,943
We can never repay you for all you've done.

291
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:28,944
No biggie.

292
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,346
What's gonna happen to Grodd?

293
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:31,481
I'll show you.

294
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:42,976
The feedback from his helmet completely wiped out his mind.

295
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:44,744
I almost feel sorry for him.

296
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:49,416
You have my solemn word that he will receive the best of care.

297
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:50,833
Not bad, huh?

298
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,802
I outsmarted a supergenius.

299
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,470
Guess you're not as dumb as you look.

300
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:55,905
Yeah, and I--

301
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,640
Hey, I resent that.

302
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,825
No one makes a monkey out of me.
