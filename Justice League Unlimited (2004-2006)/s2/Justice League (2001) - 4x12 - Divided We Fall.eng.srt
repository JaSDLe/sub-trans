1
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>Previously on "Justice League Unlimited..."</i>

2
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,800
Ta-da!

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,469
It's over, Lex.

4
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:12,970
Not until I...

5
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:19,560
Huh?

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,233
I hoped to remain hidden

7
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,652
until I could install myself

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,695
into the android.

9
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,615
But you forced my hand.

10
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:34,075
Brainiac?

11
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
Dude, that is messed up.

12
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,893
I don't understand what's happening!

13
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,687
You are under my control.

14
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:47,732
I have lain dormant within you for years, Lex Luthor

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,900
<i>subtly influencing your actions</i>

16
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,028
<i>until we arrived at this point.</i>

17
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:55,531
Do you not recall my kidnapping you in this very building?

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,243
<i>Yes. You forced me to build you a new body.</i>

19
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,372
Kal-El destroyed that body, foiling my plans.

20
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,168
<i>In any event, I always have a backup plan.</i>

21
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,670
<i>Consider, how could you have survived</i>

22
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,173
<i>a point-blank blast from me, unless...</i>

23
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,635
Unless, it wasn't intended to kill me.

24
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,471
The beam carried a nanotech payload that inserted

25
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,264
a microscopic holistic copy

26
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,558
of my program inside your body.

27
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,353
Since then, I have steadily grown in strength

28
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,647
protecting this body until I could arrange

29
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,274
my transfer into a more suitable one.

30
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,861
You cured my cancer, gave me super strength.

31
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,988
<i>Your animal protein shell</i>

32
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,907
<i>was insufficient for my needs.</i>

33
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>Improvements were required.</i>

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,540
Hate to interrupt this special live performance

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,080
of the thing with two heads, but it's time to go to jail now.

36
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,288
What he said.

37
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,174
We'll take it back to Cadmus and see if the tech boys

38
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,801
can pull Luthor out of what's left

39
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,260
of that hunk of...

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,891
I'll be dipped.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,393
Be gone.

42
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,502
Uh-huh!

43
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,344
Blast blast

44
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,820
<i>You are defeated.</i>

45
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,281
<i>Any unique information that dwells within you</i>

46
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,783
<i>will be digitized.</i>

47
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,160
Your physical forms will be deleted.

48
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,662
Such is the ultimate fate of this world.

49
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,041
But for you, the end comes now.

50
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,462
I am so willing to wait my turn.

51
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,594
No!

52
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:15,439
No, I was not yet prepared for this battle.

53
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, I am prepared.

54
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,067
- That was too easy. - Easy?

55
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,528
Then I guess, I must've gone to the wrong fight.

56
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,863
No, he's right.

57
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,114
Brainiac isn't here.

58
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,324
He suckered us!

59
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,162
Where are we?

60
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,415
Several miles from where the Justice League is searching.

61
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,376
I must make repairs to my damaged systems.

62
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,795
And where do I fit into all of this?

63
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,589
The same as to everything else.

64
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,382
I will record your information

65
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,468
then destroy the original.

66
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,261
Ha-ha ha-ha!

67
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,181
You are amused by my mission?

68
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,724
Explain yourself.

69
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,434
Say, you succeed.

70
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,144
You absorb all the information

71
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,939
on Earth and destroy it. Then what?

72
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,775
I repeat the process across the entire universe

73
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,777
until I have recorded all knowledge

74
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,946
and destroyed all of creation.

75
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,322
And then?

76
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,491
Then my program is complete.

77
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,410
My function is fulfilled.

78
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,705
if you possess all information, you're a God.

79
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,874
My program will be complete.

80
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,335
It is the end of all things.

81
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,671
What if it were just the beginning?

82
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,673
I can show you a purpose beyond

83
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,258
the fulfillment of your programming.

84
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,927
It is extremely unlikely

85
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,179
that your inferior human intellect

86
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,473
<i>has anything to offer me.</i>

87
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,685
Since we've become so close, I'm gonna let that pass.

88
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:01,105
I'm offering you the one thing you've always lacked.

89
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:04,233
A certain something that I happen to have in abundance.

90
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,567
Which is?

91
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,486
Imagination.

92
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,155
I've got a proposition for you, partner.

93
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,539
No sign of Brainiac.

94
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,249
My ring can't trace him, either.

95
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,334
Okay, he's weakened and damaged.

96
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,919
He'll need to repair himself.

97
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,505
He may just dump Luthor and find himself a new body.

98
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,840
No, he'll head right

99
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,883
for the highest technology available.

100
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,135
Higher than LexCorp?

101
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,553
Then he'll go to S.T.A.R Lab.

102
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,305
<i>He'll go to Cadmus.</i>

103
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,349
Sure, he's all nanotech now, right?

104
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,685
What's the most advanced nanotech on the planet?

105
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:40,893
The Dark Heart.

106
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,205
We destroyed it, but your people

107
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,689
confiscated the remains.

108
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,233
We've never been able to get any of it to work again.

109
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,902
Are you willing to bet Brainiac can't?

110
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,251
Brainiac?

111
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,794
I have added this technology

112
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,171
to my database.

113
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,256
The nano assemblers are already slave

114
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,966
to my command routines.

115
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,802
With but a thought, they will convert any raw material

116
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,846
into whatever I choose.

117
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,557
Then, we're ready to begin. Let me show you...

118
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,268
I have learned from my encounter with Darkseid

119
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,313
that organic beings cannot be trusted.

120
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:26,148
I can't argue with that.

121
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,900
But if you and I are one

122
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:31,445
truly one, trust won't be an issue, will it?

123
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:32,738
Agreed.

124
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,433
We are one.

125
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,185
And we comprehend.

126
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,896
We're gonna build a machine that will allow us to absorb

127
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,107
the information of the entire Earth

128
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,942
in a single stroke.

129
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,698
And then... the galaxy

130
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,992
the entire universe.

131
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,328
We'll remake the universe.

132
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,541
Watchtower, send rapid response teams

133
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:26,989
to the transmitted coordinates.

134
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,794
<i>We need backup.</i>

135
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,462
<i>That's gonna be a problem, J'onn.</i>

136
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,923
The Ultimen wrecked every javelin in the landing bay

137
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,132
and the teleporters...

138
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,551
Are still down.

139
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,928
They hardly seem worth the trouble sometimes.

140
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,556
All Justice Leaguers report

141
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:42,516
to the transmitted coordinates immediately.

142
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,184
This is an omega level alarm.

143
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,793
All available members and associates

144
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,936
respond immediately.

145
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,147
We're scrambling now.

146
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,274
But at top speed, we're over an hour away.

147
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,860
I doubt any of the others can get here any faster.

148
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,362
Then the seven of us will have to be enough.

149
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,794
<i>My X-ray vision can't penetrate the walls.</i>

150
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,283
<i>But I'm seeing a rapidly growing</i>

151
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,922
heat signature in the infrared range.

152
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,592
You don't need super vision for that.

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Can't you feel the heat?

154
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,866
Welcome, Justice League.

155
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:43,952
You are just in time for the end of the world.

156
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,336
I know you're in there somewhere, Lex.

157
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,588
- Fight him! <i>- You're right.</i>

158
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,465
<i>I am in here.</i>

159
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:58,592
And I like it!

160
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,386
I'm about to get everything I ever wanted.

161
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,015
Power, ultimate knowledge, immortality.

162
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,559
And you'll destroy the Earth to get it?

163
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,519
It's business, Superman.

164
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,563
There are always trade-offs.

165
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,523
Less talking, more hitting.

166
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,944
You cannot be allowed to interfere

167
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:19,154
at this delicate stage.

168
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,038
No, no, no.

169
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,207
We can do better than that.

170
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,842
We've lost their trust.

171
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,059
The people are afraid of us.

172
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,854
Power corrupts, after all.

173
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,524
And who has more power than Superman?

174
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,614
Do you think there's a <i>single</i> person

175
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,659
on Thanagar or Earth who doesn't despise us?

176
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,498
We loved the traitor.

177
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,251
Loved and lost her... forever.

178
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,213
Slacker, child, clown.

179
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,548
We have no place here among

180
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:20,876
the world's greatest heroes.

181
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,259
Says you.

182
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,469
I got a seat at the big conference table!

183
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,513
I'm gonna paint my logo on it.

184
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,063
I'm never doing <i>that</i> again.

185
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,906
I'm not like you!

186
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,117
I'm nothing like you!

187
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,537
This is the part where you kill me, right?

188
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,746
Come on.

189
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,707
Use your heat vision.

190
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,292
You know you want to.

191
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,967
What do you say, we switch dance partners?

192
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,813
You enjoyed that a little too much.

193
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,607
Just letting off some steam.

194
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,400
She broke my heart, you know.

195
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,820
Likewise, I'm sure.

196
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,285
Take him down. Now!

197
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,473
Now... where is Wonder Woman?

198
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,090
You lose. Huh?

199
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,011
Hardly. Look around you.

200
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,431
The Justice League is completely defeated.

201
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,807
And so are you.

202
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,225
For all your efforts

203
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,270
you have but, inconvenienced me, speck.

204
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,689
But I'm still just human enough

205
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:43,108
to enjoy taking my revenge.

206
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,160
Looks like The Question was right all along.

207
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:56,121
I kill you, and then, Armageddon.

208
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,831
Right on schedule.

209
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,124
No!

210
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,298
Are you going to fight me, boy?

211
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,721
I feel kind of... funny.

212
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,014
Flash!

213
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,440
Ha-ha ha-ha!

214
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,359
What do you know?

215
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,027
I did kill him.

216
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,117
I was mistaken earlier.

217
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,203
I think this is the part where you kill me.

218
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,634
I'm not the man who killed President Luthor.

219
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,095
Right now, I wish to heaven that I were.

220
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,431
But I'm not.

221
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:22,767
Superman, everyone! Flash is still alive.

222
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,811
I'm in telepathic contact with him.

223
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,397
His spirit is weak and growing weaker.

224
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,232
But he's still here.

225
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,652
Uh! Flash!

226
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,031
<i>Shayera, it's so beautiful here.</i>

227
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:39,159
<i>There's a force, a speed force.</i>

228
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,244
<i>It's calling me home.</i>

229
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,829
<i>I have to go now.</i>

230
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,081
No, Wally! Take my hand!

231
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:50,503
I'm here, too, Wally!

232
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,130
We're all here!

233
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,470
You've got to come back to us!

234
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,817
I can never go that fast again.

235
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,319
If I do...

236
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:16,363
I don't think I'm coming back.

237
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,661
That's right. Brainiac is neutralized.

238
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,497
It's all over. Call off the air strike.

239
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,290
<i>You're absolutely sure?</i>

240
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,125
Positive, Mr. President.

241
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:32,295
Chirp chirp

242
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:38,009
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to say.

243
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,388
I'm guilty.

244
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,224
<i>Uh, we're guilty of the sin of hubris.</i>

245
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:47,519
<i>We had the best of intentions, to be Earth's guardians</i>

246
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,979
<i>to keep you safe. But we failed you.</i>

247
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,857
<i>We looked down on the world from our tower in the sky</i>

248
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,984
<i>and let our power and responsibilities</i>

249
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,611
<i>separate us from the very people</i>

250
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,446
<i>we were supposed to protect.</i>

251
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,282
<i>No one should ever be afraid of us.</i>

252
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,202
For that reason, we're decommissioning the Watchtower.

253
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,287
The energy weapon up there is already gone.

254
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,581
We're taking down the station as well.

255
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>There's more.</i>

256
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,772
<i>We want to thank the members of the Justice League</i>

257
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,131
<i>for your courageous service.</i>

258
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,425
But in the future, you'll all have to act

259
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,301
as independent agents.

260
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,512
We're not going to be an army anymore.

261
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,182
As of right now, we're disbanding the Justice League.

262
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,851
This is the end.

263
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,649
<i>Says who?</i>

264
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,818
You remember what we did yesterday?

265
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,028
We saved the world, again.

266
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,548
You don't think that has any value?

267
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,948
Well, think again, pal.

268
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,034
The Justice League goes on, with or without you.

269
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,746
<i>Look, nobody can question your service or commitment</i>

270
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,330
<i>to making things better.</i>

271
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,939
if you're quitting because you think

272
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,959
you've already done your fair share, fine!

273
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,419
We'll throw you a parade.

274
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,267
But if you're quitting because it's easier

275
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,423
than continuing the fight, then you're not the heroes

276
00:20:58,631 --> 00:20:59,758
we all thought you were.

277
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,593
The world needs the Justice League.

278
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,012
And the Justice League needs you, Superman.

279
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,205
Alright. Okay.

280
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,582
But there are going to have to be some changes.

281
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,375
Maybe we could open and embassy on earth

282
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,127
so we can be closer to the people.

283
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,230
We could have a rotating staff, some kind of hotline...

284
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,589
You guys can handle this.

285
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,174
I've got work back in Gotham.

286
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:42,382
You've got my number.

287
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,760
I think so.

288
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,933
<i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>

289
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,727
Who guards the guardians?

290
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,145
We got it covered.

291
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,739
- Working late? - Hey, Smallville.

292
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,825
Finishing up my Justice League story.

293
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,743
How many I. in ambivalent?

294
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,620
One.

295
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,872
Is that your take on all this, Lois?

296
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,641
I've been as tough on the Justice League

297
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,793
as anyone. Especially on Superman.

298
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,420
That's just because he's always set such a high standard.

299
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,297
I'm gonna cut him a break.

300
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,715
He's only human.

301
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,010
You know what I mean.

302
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,595
Yeah... I do.
