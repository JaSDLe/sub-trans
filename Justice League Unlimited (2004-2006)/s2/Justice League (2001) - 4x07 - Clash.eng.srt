1
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,174
Go! Go! Go!

2
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,621
J'onn, we're in trouble.

3
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,373
<i>Are you asking for help?</i>

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,167
- Yes. - <i>You never ask for help.</i>

5
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,169
Just get us some reinforcements.

6
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:52,945
<i>Superman, you're needed.</i>

7
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,573
I'm in the middle of something. Can it wait?

8
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,787
<i>Unfortunately, no. It's the parasite.</i>

9
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,956
Give me half a minute and I'll be right...

10
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,686
- Good work. - It was nothing really.

11
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,563
Hey, I think he's blushing.

12
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,608
Don't be modest, kid.

13
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,027
I don't even think Superman could have done a better...

14
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,529
We-we were just talking about you.

15
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,406
- And you are? - Oh, that's right.

16
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,784
You were on a space mission when we recruited him.

17
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:42,828
I'm Captain Marvel, sir, and it is an honor.

18
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,456
- You're my biggest fan. - Excuse me?

19
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,960
I-I mean, I'm your biggest fan. Sorry, sir, it's uh...

20
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,879
It's a little overwhelming meeting you.

21
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,256
It's a pleasure, Captain, a real pleasure.

22
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,584
<i>- Captain Marvel! - Captain Marvel, over here!</i>

23
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,299
Gosh, take it easy, folks. One at a time, okay?

24
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,925
Lois Lane, Captain, "Daily Planet."

25
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,428
How does it feel to be part of the Justice League?

26
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:25,681
How does it feel? Like I've waited my whole life for this.

27
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,933
I mean, being on the same team with Superman

28
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,852
Batman, Wonder Woman...

29
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,062
I still can't believe they actually let me join.

30
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,026
What is it you value so much about the League?

31
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,653
Golly, I guess it's all the good they do.

32
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,697
Not just helping people which is great, I mean

33
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,226
that's the reason we're all here in the first place, right?

34
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:45,868
But they really make a difference.

35
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:47,203
They change the world.

36
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,164
- How so? - Well, just look at Lex Luthor.

37
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,132
He used to be a supervillain, for Pete's sake

38
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,394
and now he's one of the good guys, I think it's terrific

39
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:56,098
that he's running for president, don't you?

40
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,757
Uh, are you moving to Metropolis from Fawcett City?

41
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,884
No, ma'am, I help where I'm needed

42
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,594
but I'm a Fawcett boy at heart.

43
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,923
- I have one other question! - Just one more question!

44
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,915
Sorry, folks, but I really gotta go.

45
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,352
- But before you go... - Wait, wait, one more.

46
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,916
Shazam!

47
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,842
By 1939, President Roosevelt's key adversary

48
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,052
in Europe was a dictator named...

49
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,971
- Billy Batson. - Yes, ma'am?

50
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,557
- You're late again. - Yes, ma'am.

51
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,851
Isn't it time you learned to take some responsibility

52
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,020
for yourself, Billy? isn't it time you grew up a little?

53
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,064
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,492
Hey, guys.

55
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,996
How you doing?

56
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,039
Captain Atom, hi.

57
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,382
Vigilante, how's it going, buddy?

58
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,593
Shining Knight, wow, look at you.

59
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,678
That's new armor, isn't it?

60
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,682
- Something wrong? - Come with me.

61
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,991
Have you read the papers today?

62
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,077
Just the comics. "Snorkel, The Squirrel" was hilarious.

63
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,566
He's looking for his nuts, right?

64
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:55,502
And then Berkley, that's this wacky bear, he...

65
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,754
Holy moly!

66
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,173
When you joined this team, you became something

67
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,883
more than just a hero.

68
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,718
I know that, sir, but...

69
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,097
You became a symbol, a symbol that represents all of us.

70
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,725
- Yes, sir. - We don't play favorites.

71
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,727
We don't sell deodorant on television.

72
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,812
And we don't get involved in politics.

73
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,147
Yes, sir.

74
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,732
And we certainly don't endorse

75
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,984
supervillains for the presidency.

76
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,444
Now, now, wait a minute.

77
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,571
I never said that I was endorsing Luthor.

78
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,780
Just that, I think it's great that someone like him

79
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:30,991
can change into a good guy.

80
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,036
Life just isn't that simple.

81
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,997
Well, maybe it is sometimes. Maybe people can change.

82
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,422
Can't they?

83
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,427
You are not to make any more public statements

84
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,930
without running them past the League first.

85
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,517
- Is that understood? - Yes, sir.

86
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,195
<i>America is a nation of second chances.</i>

87
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,365
And no one embodies that concept more than tonight's guest

88
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,075
once viewed as, shall we say

89
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,828
a less than admirable member of our society.

90
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,955
Much less, I'm afraid.

91
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,791
<i>Lex Luthor has transformed himself into a respected</i>

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,919
<i>and admired presidential candidate and we're delighted</i>

93
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,463
<i>to welcome him to "The O' Bannon Agenda."</i>

94
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,800
<i>Thank you, Phil, but I'm not here tonight as a campaigner.</i>

95
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,510
<i>I'm here to talk about something</i>

96
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,470
<i>far bigger than mere politics.</i>

97
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,599
- And that would be? - My newest project, Lexor City.

98
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,810
A fully-functional urban paradise built

99
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,646
for low-income Americans in search of that second chance

100
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,064
you were just talking about.

101
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,816
Let's be straight here, Lex.

102
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,610
There are people out there right now rolling their eyes.

103
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,863
<i>They're saying that Lex Luthor hasn't changed</i>

104
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,656
<i>that he can't be trusted.</i>

105
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,744
Can't say I blame them. But people can change.

106
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,371
- Take Hawkgirl, for instance. <i>- You take her.</i>

107
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,914
<i>Now, Phil...</i>

108
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,666
- Hey, what you watching? - Shh!

109
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,003
<i>My point is, yes, she betrayed the Justice League.</i>

110
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,671
Yes, as a consequence of her actions

111
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,466
the Thanagarians almost destroyed our planet.

112
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:14,219
But seeing as how the League has welcomed her back into the fold

113
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,846
<i>they've apparently forgiven her</i>

114
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,098
<i>and offered her a second chance.</i>

115
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,809
They've taken a lot of heat for that decision.

116
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,980
Maybe they're being naive. Some might say dangerously so.

117
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,567
Or maybe they just want to give her a chance to redeem herself.

118
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,194
<i>According to Captain Marvel</i>

119
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,282
<i>they're giving me the same benefit of the doubt.</i>

120
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,407
And believe me, I intend to make the most of it.

121
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,619
Lexor City is my way of accepting their goodwill

122
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:39,995
and passing it on.

123
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,247
I hear there's a huge open house event

124
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,084
tomorrow night with all proceeds going to charity.

125
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,754
That's right, Phil, and I'm hoping Superman will attend.

126
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,631
I know how much he loves charities.

127
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,216
Hey, that's great, isn't it?

128
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,744
<i>Let's talk about your presidential</i>

129
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,761
<i>campaign, Lex, a "Daily Planet" poll</i>

130
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,555
<i>of likely voters shows you're only two points...</i>

131
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,910
You were a little hard on the boy scout, don't you think?

132
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,626
I thought I was the boy scout.

133
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,170
I did too, till I met Captain Marvel.

134
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,844
What did these guys want anyway?

135
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:40,639
To take over the world, or rob banks, I forget.

136
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,317
But back to Captain Marvel, why are you...

137
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,403
Why is everyone defending him?

138
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,572
<i>We like him.</i>

139
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,283
He's sunny.

140
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,993
- <i>Superman?</i> - Yes?

141
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,619
<i>This is Emile Hamilton.</i>

142
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,468
<i>J'onn was kind enough to patch me through.</i>

143
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,039
What is it, professor?

144
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,083
<i>There's something here I think you should see.</i>

145
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,422
if it's just a simple robbery, why call us?

146
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,007
It was anything, but simple.

147
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,885
They ignored valuables, priceless gems

148
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,970
high technology artifacts.

149
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,281
In fact, the only thing they took

150
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,015
was the contents of this safe.

151
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:27,436
Nearly four pounds of weapons-grade Kryptonite.

152
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,363
- So? - The lock was nano-picked.

153
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,490
- LexCorp Technology. - Then Luthor...

154
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,410
Which anyone could have gotten their hands on.

155
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,622
Or, for that matter, planted here to incriminate Luthor.

156
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,917
- You know it was him. - I'm not entirely convinced.

157
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,793
This is pretty sloppy for Lex.

158
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,213
He's the most arrogant human being on the planet.

159
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,548
- He wants us to know. - Maybe.

160
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,884
- Maybe? - I'll go to the Watchtower.

161
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,386
See if the Atom can find something I missed.

162
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,305
Since when do you miss anything?

163
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:06,725
Since when do you jump to conclusions without evidence?

164
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,477
Go to that charity event tonight.

165
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,062
You'll help raise some money

166
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,648
and keep an eye on our elusive Mr. Luthor.

167
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:20,155
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Lexor City.</i>

168
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,115
<i>In just a few short weeks</i>

169
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,202
these children, whose lives have been bleak and troubled

170
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,747
whose parents have been waging a losing war against poverty

171
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,542
will be moving here to our city of tomorrow.

172
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,296
Now, go on, you little scamps, have yourselves a ball.

173
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,602
<i>It's the most ambitious project I've ever been a part of.</i>

174
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:55,065
<i>A fully-functional city to house those most in need.</i>

175
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,442
Just think of it, ladies and gentlemen

176
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,029
thirty thousand people who'll never again have to worry

177
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,906
about a roof over their heads

178
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,660
about a safe, clean environment for their children.

179
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,537
Thirty thousand people.

180
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,251
I'm sorry, but this...

181
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,046
This is truly the greatest day of my life.

182
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,555
I never knew you had such a sentimental streak, Lex.

183
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:30,559
Oh, there's so much about me you don't know, Superman.

184
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,395
I'd like to thank the Man Of Steel for putting aside

185
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:36,898
our differences and lending his prestigious presence

186
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,109
to this very special night.

187
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,361
Anything for a good cause.

188
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,656
To Superman, our hero.

189
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,950
Our hero!

190
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,457
Excuse me, Lex.

191
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,792
I'll be back in just a moment.

192
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,461
Don't eat too much.

193
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,218
The device is in place. T minus six minutes.

194
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,722
Excellent. Make sure my escape route is secure.

195
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,219
Clear the area immediately. Everybody, out now.

196
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,561
- Superman? - No time, Lois.

197
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,146
Get as far away as you can.

198
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,740
Shazam!

199
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,249
- Wait, you don't understand. - Out of my way, Lex.

200
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:18,726
I don't know what's down there, but...

201
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,128
Hey, guys, guys, let's take it easy, okay?

202
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,547
Captain Marvel, thank heaven you're here.

203
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,298
He just won't listen. He's...

204
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,300
You don't have X-ray vision. I do.

205
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,269
There's some sort of device buried beneath us

206
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,554
and I'm shutting it down.

207
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,223
No, if you touch it, it could go off.

208
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,724
Go off?

209
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,352
So you admit you put a bomb under this city?

210
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,439
Not a bomb. An experimental fusion engine.

211
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,065
It will supply nearly free energy

212
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,650
to everyone who lives here.

213
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,027
- See? - Then why the lead shielding?

214
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,905
It's for your protection, the engine creates energy

215
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,658
through controlled fusion of Kryptonite molecules.

216
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,909
See?

217
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,453
And why didn't you tell me this?

218
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:59,833
Maybe, maybe I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

219
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,461
Let's call The Atom or Steel to check the device over.

220
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,296
See if what Luthor says is true.

221
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:07,215
At least someone around here is keeping a cool head.

222
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,424
There's no time for this.

223
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,761
You can't just...

224
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,435
That's it! No more Mr. Nice guy.

225
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,783
Captain, please, there has to be another way.

226
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,713
Shazam!

227
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,258
Shazam!

228
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,056
Shazam...

229
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,815
- Shaza... - Fight's over, son.

230
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:33,295
Well?

231
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,673
It, uh...

232
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:37,300
seems to be exactly what Luthor said it was.

233
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,180
I... I'm sorry. I-I didn't...

234
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,142
If anyone should apologize, Superman, it's me.

235
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,479
I shouldn't have tried to make the free power a surprise.

236
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,150
Given the circumstances, I should have known better.

237
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,029
Of course, the Justice League will pay for the damage.

238
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,407
Oh, no. I won't allow it.

239
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,371
This one's on me.

240
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,605
- Look, Captain, I wanted... - No more lectures.

241
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,275
I called this meeting, and I'm gonna have my say.

242
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,819
But my whole life, I've looked up to the League.

243
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,573
You were my heroes, every one of you.

244
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:45,034
<i>And you, you were more than a hero.</i>

245
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,204
I idolized you. I wanted to be you.

246
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,333
Whenever I was out there facing down the bad guys

247
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,876
I'd think, "What would Superman do?"

248
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:56,254
Now I know. I believe in fair play.

249
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,715
<i>I believe in taking people at their word</i>

250
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,401
<i>and giving them the benefit of the doubt.</i>

251
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,985
<i>Back home, I've come up against my share</i>

252
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,387
<i>of pretty nasty, bad guys but I never had to act</i>

253
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,389
<i>the way they did to win a fight.</i>

254
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>I always found another way.</i>

255
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:12,604
I... I guess I'm saying I-I like being a hero.

256
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:17,025
A symbol, and that's why I'm...

257
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,943
quitting the Justice League.

258
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,572
You don't act like heroes anymore.

259
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,212
- He's right. - They set you up, Clark.

260
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,131
Does it really make a difference? After all, I...

261
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,050
- They? - They.

262
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,850
The plan worked better than I'd hoped.

263
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,604
All I wanted was for Superman to destroy the energy source.

264
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,691
But battling Captain Marvel, demolishing Lexor City

265
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,570
while those media morons filmed every horrific moment

266
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,573
it was more than I ever could have hoped for.

267
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,159
<i>Everything's going according to plan.</i>

268
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,163
And we're just getting started.
