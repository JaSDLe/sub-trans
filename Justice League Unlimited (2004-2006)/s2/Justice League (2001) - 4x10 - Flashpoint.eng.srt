1
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:07,673
<i>Previously on "Justice League Unlimited..."</i>

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,717
<i>Question and Huntress have copied files</i>

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,594
from a high-security Cadmus terminal.

4
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,513
<i>What did they get?</i>

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>Maybe everything.</i>

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,682
I did love being a hero

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,392
but if this is where it leads

8
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,602
I'm done with it.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,687
We would never fight the government.

10
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,315
I believe you took something that belongs to me.

11
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,820
Just tell me what you've learned.

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,658
Good to see you, captain.

13
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,993
Cover our flank.

14
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,096
My orders are to prevent you from taking Question

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
out of this facility.

16
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:41,082
So how's this gonna go down?

17
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:47,647
This is ridiculous!

18
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,015
If you're not gonna help us...

19
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,192
get out of our way.

20
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,819
Not an option, Superman.

21
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,738
I've got my orders, legal and proper.

22
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,991
Dude, Superman just told you to step aside.

23
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,451
I heard him, ma'am.

24
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,994
Not gonna happen.

25
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,251
I control radiation, Superman.

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,587
That includes red sun radiation.

27
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,964
Get Question out of here. Don't wait for me.

28
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,924
What made you think I was gonna?

29
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,385
Call J'onn for transport when you get outside.

30
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,928
This building's comlink shielded.

31
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,930
Nobody's going anywhere with Question.

32
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,515
Thought I made that clear.

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,656
You shouldn't have come for me.

34
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,309
You shouldn't have snuck away without me.

35
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,017
Locked. Sure, why not?

36
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,112
Come on. Come on!

37
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,453
That's convenient.

38
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,089
- I can't make it. - Sure you can.

39
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,148
This is Huntress. Two for emergency pick up.

40
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:36,126
<i>You are no longer a member of the Justice League.</i>

41
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,590
<i>- Clear this channel...</i> - Save it!

42
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,320
Q is down, and we're under fire.

43
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,047
Get us out of here, then scan the area.

44
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,656
Superman won't be far behind us.

45
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:03,260
I've had just about enough of the energy blasts.

46
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,945
You fought a good fight. Stay down.

47
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,574
I can't do that, Superman.

48
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,761
<i>Don't you touch him!</i>

49
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,181
He's Justice League.

50
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,134
Wait.

51
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,677
Get this...

52
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,846
<i>off my face.</i>

53
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,058
Aerosol...

54
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,394
in my coat pocket.

55
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,410
You were right.

56
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,829
I am the ugliest guy of all time.

57
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,624
Not in my eyes.

58
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,013
What happened?

59
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,557
Cadmus turned him against us.

60
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,766
No way.

61
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,310
He'd never do that.

62
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:17,561
But he did.

63
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,272
And so did Professor Hamilton.

64
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,441
Hamilton's working for Cadmus.

65
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,890
<i>He's probably the one who...</i>

66
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,653
Cloned me. Why?

67
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:27,613
He was <i>afraid</i> of us.

68
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,950
I'm sorry, Kara.

69
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,952
Don't be, just tell me when we're gonna go

70
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,203
and shut them down.

71
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,871
One stop first.

72
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,164
Wait here.

73
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,500
What's going on?

74
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,421
He's gonna be fine, but he needs his rest.

75
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,215
I'll only be a moment.

76
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,092
It's okay, Helena.

77
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,098
Five minutes.

78
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,184
<i>What happened, Question?</i>

79
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,978
How did Cadmus get a hold of you?

80
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,396
I went to kill Luthor

81
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,356
so that <i>you</i> wouldn't be able to.

82
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,274
That's <i>not</i> how we do things.

83
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,902
How do we do things, Superman?

84
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,696
Your counterpart killed Luthor.

85
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,198
This Luthor is scheming to enrage you.

86
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,607
Doing a pretty good job of it.

87
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,702
Ruining your reputation, turning your friends

88
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,203
and comrades against you.

89
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,372
<i>Creating a super powered arms race...</i>

90
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,791
but you <i>cannot</i> succumb.

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,336
I can shut down Cadmus <i>without</i> killing Luthor.

92
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,630
Carry on, then.

93
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,257
If you're wrong...

94
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,884
it's not like it's the end of the world, right?

95
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,934
<i>Give me one good reason</i>

96
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,395
not to go down there and take them out.

97
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:42,855
If you didn't know the answer

98
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,898
you wouldn't have bothered to ask.

99
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,818
Don't handle me, J'onn. I'm serious.

100
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,236
We don't have hard evidence

101
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,765
that they've committed any crimes.

102
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,656
Oh, come on! You know they're dirty!

103
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,265
Then maybe we should put more energy

104
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,764
into proving it, and less into acting

105
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,911
like a bunch of hyperthyroid storm troopers.

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,247
I don't remember asking you for your opinion.

107
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,708
No, how about when you guys hijacked me up here

108
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,377
against my will, and made me join this team?

109
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,088
Batman said I was supposed to keep you guys honest.

110
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,340
Do I look like Batman to you?

111
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,259
Actually, you kinda do.

112
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,188
Especially when you're all scowly like that.

113
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,598
We can't let Cadmus get away with it!

114
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,016
No one's saying we should.

115
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:21,518
But we have to keep a cool head.

116
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,228
Do you know what they did to me?

117
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,897
Look, kid...

118
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,345
Hamilton's a piece of garbage

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,941
and Luthor's worse.

120
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,568
But this <i>isn't</i> the way to stop them.

121
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,154
We must also consider the possibility that Cadmus

122
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,697
is right to be afraid of us.

123
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,906
What?

124
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,200
And there is strong evidence

125
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,951
of Cadmus having legitimate connections

126
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
to the government.

127
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,288
Maybe, to some rogue black ops group.

128
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,932
The real government wouldn't get involved

129
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:44,124
in anything like this.

130
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,834
Hey, I'm the only guy in the room

131
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,212
who doesn't have superpowers, and let me tell you...

132
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,922
you guys scare me.

133
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,025
<i>What if you <i>do</i> decide to go marching down there</i>

134
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,884
<i>taking care of whoever you think is guilty.</i>

135
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,552
<i>Who could stop you? Me?</i>

136
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,179
So you <i>want</i> the government to have

137
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:58,680
a bunch of superhuman weapons

138
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,390
just to keep <i>us</i> in check?

139
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,227
No! I don't know.

140
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,686
Yeah!

141
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,981
Look, I'm an old lefty.

142
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,650
The government must do for people

143
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,568
what people can't do for themselves.

144
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,337
The people sure can't protect themselves

145
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,738
from the likes of us.

146
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,907
We're not talking about the government.

147
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,516
We're talking about a shadow cabinet

148
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,911
that's taken it upon themselves to <i>eliminate</i> us.

149
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,162
They came after us

150
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,456
we have to hit them back hard!

151
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,916
Grammy Flash always used to say

152
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,918
the trouble with an eye for an eye...

153
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,962
is that everybody ends up blind.

154
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,517
What is it?

155
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,603
It's Waller. Superman broke into Cadmus.

156
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,439
When he left, he took Question and Captain Atom with him.

157
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:50,816
That was fast.

158
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:53,569
- Still, opportunity knocks. <i>- What?</i>

159
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:57,197
Sorry. I'm working on something here. Go on.

160
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,867
<i>The continual security breaches are bad enough.</i>

161
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,994
<i>But now that Question's back with the League</i>

162
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,705
<i>and we still don't know what he's learned.</i>

163
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,790
What's the worst-case scenario?

164
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,834
<i>If they've got enough to tie you to this</i>

165
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,711
<i>they'll head right for your doorstep.</i>

166
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,463
Let them come. I've got a full pardon from the President.

167
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,424
Not for any new crimes, Lex.

168
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,551
If <i>you</i> get arrested, we'll disavow

169
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,595
any knowledge of your actions.

170
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,722
Well, that would be inconvenient.

171
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,017
But I wouldn't worry about the Justice League quite yet.

172
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:26,935
They have problems of their own.

173
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,604
Goodbye, Mrs. Waller.

174
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,112
I still think we should go down to Cadmus

175
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,656
take them out and accept any consequences after...

176
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,492
Computer, report.

177
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,161
Binary fusion generator

178
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,414
initialization sequence in progress.

179
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,708
- Abort. - Unable to comply.

180
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,001
System locked.

181
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,378
Override. Command authority 004.

182
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,882
<i>System administrator, J'onn J'onzz recognized.</i>

183
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,467
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

184
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,928
All hands, prepare for binary fusion discharge.

185
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,136
<i>This is not a drill!</i>

186
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,722
- Let's move it! - Come on.

187
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,147
I've to do it the hard way.

188
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,909
Rerouting binary fusion control.

189
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:26,078
Bypassing circuit break.

190
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,518
Hey!

191
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,811
Huh?

192
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,158
- Come on! - Get out of here!

193
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,670
<i>Emergency power activated.</i>

194
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,589
<i>To preserve air quality</i>

195
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,675
<i>please refrain from any strenuous activity.</i>

196
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,719
<i>Repair crews to stations.</i>

197
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,928
Status report.

198
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,430
Full power in 58 minutes.

199
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,016
I need sensors and long-range con now!

200
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,351
We're blind up here.

201
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,703
I don't even know how much damage

202
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,853
the fusion beam caused.

203
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,605
Maybe we can patch communications

204
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,065
through one of the annexes.

205
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,192
- A couple of minutes? - Do it.

206
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,028
<i>Steel, Atom, get down to the reactor room</i>

207
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,357
<i>and see if you can't shave some time off the reboot.</i>

208
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,158
What did we hit?

209
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,160
Cadmus headquarters.

210
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,370
Holy...

211
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,722
There's gonna be some people who need

212
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,831
our help down there.

213
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,541
I'm taking a couple of rescue teams.

214
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,709
Agreed, but the teleporters are offline.

215
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,753
And the bay doors won't open without power.

216
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,088
We'll think of something.

217
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,339
Whoa!

218
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,925
Is that who I think it is?

219
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,303
Mr. President.

220
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,512
Come on.

221
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,640
You, too, Arrow.

222
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,893
<i>Mr. President, I know this looks bad.</i>

223
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,187
<i>Is that supposed to be some kind of Martian humor?</i>

224
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,690
<i>- No, sir. - I need some answers, J'onn.</i>

225
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,442
Why, exactly, did the Justice League

226
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,819
destroy a high-security R&D facility?

227
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,530
All appearances to the contrary, the Justice League

228
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,907
<i>did not</i> fire the binary fusion weapon.

229
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,826
<i>Sure looked that way from down here.</i>

230
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:54,327
<i>Lt was activated remotely</i>

231
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,746
<i>by person or persons unknown.</i>

232
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,373
I'd like to believe you, J'onn.

233
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,725
<i>We've never given you any reason</i>

234
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:00,959
<i>to doubt our word, sir.</i>

235
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,878
Even so, I've repeatedly expressed

236
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,921
my strongest disapproval of you guys having

237
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,340
that space cannon floating over everybody's head!

238
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,801
If we'd had it during the Thanagarian invasion

239
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,137
we <i>might</i> have avoided a great deal of suffering.

240
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:15,265
We don't intend to be caught unprepared a second time.

241
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,392
I don't want to have this argument again.

242
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,561
You're not holding a strong hand right now anyway.

243
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,231
My people are investigating this incident.

244
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,108
You guys have saved the world more times

245
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,528
<i>than I've shot under par, so we give you a lot of slack.</i>

246
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,864
<i>But if it turns out, you are responsible</i>

247
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>the full weight of the United States government</i>

248
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,784
<i>is coming down on you. Got it?</i>

249
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:35,993
Understood.

250
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,662
Thank you, Mr. President.

251
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,592
Put your back into it, big guy.

252
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,448
<i>Unlogged priority call on line four, Mr. President.</i>

253
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,786
I'm surprised to hear from you, Amanda.

254
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,955
My boys at NSA are reporting that you're dead.

255
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,083
We had a security breach at Cadmus.

256
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,371
I had the facility scrubbed

257
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,087
and moved per standard protocol.

258
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,881
The Justice League fired on an abandoned facility.

259
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,290
<i>So there were no casualties?</i>

260
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,968
Not for lack of trying.

261
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:34,886
We don't know that for sure yet.

262
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,555
<i>This was retaliation, sir.</i>

263
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,056
<i>Pure and simple.</i>

264
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,684
We captured the Question, they bust him out

265
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,270
and an hour later, it's death from above.

266
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:46,565
If you're right, it's our worst fears realized.

267
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,275
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

268
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,763
<i>What are you gonna do about it?</i>

269
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,403
<i>I'm weighing my options.</i>

270
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,113
Mr. President...

271
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,532
if we're where I think we are

272
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,617
Cadmus is your <i>only</i> option.

273
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>I'll let you know, Amanda.</i>

274
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,037
<i>Stay on high alert.</i>

275
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:14,593
- We did this. - No, we didn't.

276
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,886
You saw. Somebody took over the controls.

277
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,179
It's our gun.

278
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,598
If we didn't have it...

279
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,516
they couldn't have used it.

280
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:26,229
It's too much power for anyone to have.

281
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,554
We can't go back, honey. It's not safe.

282
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,057
But he'll be scared all by himself.

283
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,935
There's plenty of food until they let us back into the house.

284
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,895
You guys came out of the blue duplex?

285
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,439
Yeah, my daughter's worried about...

286
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,648
her cat.

287
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,817
Bebop!

288
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,419
Nobody should have to spend the night

289
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,904
in a strange place without their kitten.

290
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,823
Here you go.

291
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,658
Quite a grip she has there.

292
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,034
Claws and all.

293
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,787
- Starting to really hurt. - Thank you.

294
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:08,415
Trim her claws and we'll call it even.

295
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,834
Seriously, thank you for everything.

296
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,585
I see you guys on the news all the time

297
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,296
and... I guess we just take you for granted.

298
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,800
It's a rotten situation.

299
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,111
I'm glad we could lend a hand.

300
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,428
If you care so much

301
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:23,888
why did you shoot at us in the first place?

302
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,515
We did-I...

303
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,933
What do you mean?

304
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,269
First they shoot at us, then they come help us.

305
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:30,645
It's not that simple, buddy.

306
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,981
I heard it was an industrial accident.

307
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,275
Are you saying you <i>did</i> shoot at us?

308
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:36,483
Well, I saw it!

309
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,445
A big laser beam from the sky

310
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:39,946
just like the one you guys used

311
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,275
to shoot those alien spiders

312
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,402
in Nevada a few months ago.

313
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,950
It was an accident.

314
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,077
Well, that makes me feel a <i>lot</i> better!

315
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,454
Alright, let's calm down.

316
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,873
We'd never do anything to hurt you.

317
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,459
You have to trust us.

318
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,878
Those ships will move you to a temporary shelter.

319
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,671
It's safer.

320
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,506
I'll take my chances.

321
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,137
I'm not sure what I'm doing here anymore.

322
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,474
People need us. We help them.

323
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,872
I'm done with waiting!

324
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,957
Somebody's got to do something about this.

325
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,134
I take it you're fit for duty again?

326
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,887
Yeah. Never been fitter.

327
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:47,806
Good. Come with me.

328
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,736
Your mission is to take down the Justice League.

329
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,823
You're going to need help.

330
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:23,842
Get it done.
