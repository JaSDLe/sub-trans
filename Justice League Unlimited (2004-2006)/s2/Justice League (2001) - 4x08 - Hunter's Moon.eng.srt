1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,140
Mari, are you crazy?

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,202
Do you know what I could do to you with this ring?

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,062
- Promises, promises. - why the ambush?

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,940
Seems like the only way I can get your attention.

5
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:26,108
We haven't gone out in nearly a month.

6
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,777
It hasn't been that long.

7
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,265
Not going to argue about it, boo.

8
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,447
You're taking me out to dinner tonight.

9
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,742
- I'm in the mood for Chinese. - The place by my apartment?

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,329
No, a romantic little spot I know in Beijing.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,665
I'm not off-shift until 1600 hours.

12
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:42,458
<i>That's breakfast time in China.</i>

13
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,878
- I like breakfast. It's a date. - Okay.

14
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>John, aren't you forgetting something?</i>

15
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:54,845
Whoops!

16
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,890
This isn't the time or place, Mari. It's unprofessional.

17
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,772
I'm compensating for the interference. Say again?

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,775
This is a distress call from the mining ship, Hockalint.

19
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,653
We took samples from a vein of unidentified ore

20
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,905
and that's when everything started going wrong.

21
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,116
Slow down. Tell me what happened.

22
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:19,370
Radiation from the ore. Ship's main power is off-line.

23
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,540
We're stranded, and there's some kind of chain reaction

24
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:25,293
taking place in the vein we took the sample from.

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,128
I need your data on the ore.

26
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:29,213
Transmitting for all the good it will do.

27
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,800
It appears to be a simple hematite

28
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,261
but iron oxide isn't radioactive.

29
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:40,057
Look at the atomic number, 676. It makes no sense.

30
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,517
Shayera.

31
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:49,108
- Is this what I think it is? - It's transuranic iron ore.

32
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,320
Nth metal, like my mace but unrefined. What about it?

33
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:55,573
We're stranded on a rock pretty much made of the stuff.

34
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,408
Are we in any danger?

35
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,120
Sit tight, don't move, and don't touch anything.

36
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,080
Prep a Javelin for me. I'm on my way.

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,499
Wait, I'm assigning a support team.

38
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,418
Don't need one. I'll handle it myself.

39
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,253
That wasn't a suggestion.

40
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,582
You haven't been pulling your weight as a team leader.

41
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,300
- Excuse me? - You're not alone anymore.

42
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:18,471
- Stop behaving as if you are. - I'll go with you.

43
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,848
No, you won't. You're both founding members.

44
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,600
I don't want there to be any question

45
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,848
who's leading the mission.

46
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,728
Then I'll go.

47
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,690
- Fine. - You got to be kidding me.

48
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,942
Javelin-26 is ready for you on pad nine.

49
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,695
I'll have the last team member meet you there.

50
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,405
Come on then.

51
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,453
- Yes? - Why did you do that?

52
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,288
Vixen hasn't spent much time in space.

53
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,832
- Good experience for her. - You know what I mean.

54
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,835
Sending my girlfriend and my ex on the same mission?

55
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,546
Difficult as it may be for you to believe

56
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,555
I don't take your love life into consideration

57
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,843
when I make command decisions.

58
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,471
I've assembled a rescue party. Help is on the way.

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,140
Signing off. I don't know how to thank you.

60
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:08,604
But I'm sure I'll think of something.

61
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,008
<i>No, no, no. Reset your hyperdrive vectors.</i>

62
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,260
Nobody likes a backseat driver, ma'am.

63
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,720
You need another 20 hours

64
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,513
of flight time before you're certified.

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,183
And some of us are already right certifiable.

66
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,791
Vigilante, you got a problem with me

67
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,976
we can take it to the gym after the mission's over.

68
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,314
No problem, ma'am. Resetting the vectors.

69
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,824
Maybe you ought to try riding sidesaddle for a change.

70
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,577
Let him be. Men have fragile egos.

71
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,538
To get what you want, you have to know how to talk to them.

72
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,957
- I don't do that. - So I've heard.

73
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,626
But maybe you ought to learn.

74
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,364
Guys, I'm not seeing a mining ship out there.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,202
There's nothing on sensors either.

76
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,996
I followed the distress beacon, just like in the manual.

77
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,915
Not saying you didn't, but this is weird.

78
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:36,293
I'm not detecting any Nth metal either.

79
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,212
We could sit here studying on it all night

80
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,797
or we could go take a looksy.

81
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,424
Alright, but stay sharp. This looks funky.

82
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,900
Somebody was here. Maybe they went into the mines.

83
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,371
What is it?

84
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,164
<i>The shadow's fake.</i>

85
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,962
The whole mine's a hologram. We've been suckered.

86
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,213
Move!

87
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,892
Back to the Javelin. Vig, lay down some cover fire.

88
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,738
Scatter!

89
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,581
Head for cover!

90
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,270
Can you even see what you're shooting at?

91
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,356
Nope, just keepin' 'em honest.

92
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,274
Giving away our position is more like it.

93
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,901
You got a better idea, I'm open.

94
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,004
How about we fight the bad guys instead of each...

95
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>Shayera Hol!</i>

96
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,663
Paran Dul?

97
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,540
- Friend of yours? - Birds of a feather.

98
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,335
Did you really think you could get away with betraying

99
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,712
the entire Thanagarian Empire?

100
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,090
Hold up. I thought we were the ones she betrayed.

101
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,968
Sounds like she betrayed everybody, cowboy.

102
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:53,180
You helped the Justice League destroy my Hyperspace Bypass.

103
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,058
Only to stop you from killing everyone on Earth.

104
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,061
That bypass was our last hope.

105
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,981
Without it, we were helpless against our enemies.

106
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,651
<i>Because of you, the Thanagarian Empire lost the war.</i>

107
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,031
<i>Nothing to say, traitor, or hadn't you heard?</i>

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,410
Hro. What happened to Hro?

109
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:17,788
After you and the Justice League destroyed the bypass

110
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,583
our fleet was ordered back to Thanagar.

111
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,045
<i>By the time we exited Hyperspace, the Gordanians</i>

112
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,173
<i>had already begun their final assault on our home world.</i>

113
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:33,053
<i>In their minds, the war was over, but not for Hro Talek.</i>

114
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,890
<i>He single-handedly destroyed a dozen of the enemy battleships.</i>

115
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,308
<i>More.</i>

116
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,312
<i>But finally, the battle was lost.</i>

117
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:46,650
<i>Of our entire fleet, only Hro Talek's ship remained.</i>

118
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:55,492
<i>He ordered us into a scout ship.</i>

119
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,637
<i>We barely made it out.</i>

120
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,156
<i>With his final breath...</i>

121
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,742
<i>he destroyed the Gordanian flagship.</i>

122
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:46,293
Too little, too late. The war was already lost.

123
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,255
I didn't know.

124
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,174
You still have feelings for him.

125
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:55,385
For a lot of people I've let down.

126
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,346
<i>All we want is Shayera Hol.</i>

127
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,848
if you hand her over, the rest of you can go free.

128
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,850
If you choose to fight with her

129
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,520
you will most assuredly die with her.

130
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,396
Let me think on that.

131
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,489
You don't speak for the team. I do.

132
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,157
Maybe I should let them take me.

133
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,535
Like horse hockey. Pardon my French.

134
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:23,205
We're Justice League. We don't turn our backs on our teammates.

135
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:25,457
Still having a little trouble with that notion, huh?

136
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,947
This is a waste of time.

137
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,491
We should be headed back home

138
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,034
to join the resistance.

139
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,453
Not until the traitor is dead.

140
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,581
Or until she kills us.

141
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,334
No, we're here to kill Shayera.

142
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,838
Calm down, Kragger. Calm down.

143
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,798
We're killing her though, right?

144
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,301
Of course. Put him down.

145
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:23,974
Don't confuse me. My head doesn't work so good since...

146
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,561
It doesn't work so good. But I remember, it's Shayera's fault.

147
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,315
- I'm this way, right? - Right. That's right.

148
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:34,818
She hurt us all and we're going to hurt her back.

149
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,661
I'm just saying, Shayera Hol was an instructor

150
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,205
in espionage wing.

151
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:48,533
She's better trained than the five of us put together.

152
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,460
Then we'll just have to out-think her, won't we?

153
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,468
- Hold your fire. - What? That's loco. I got him.

154
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,429
He wouldn't be flying that low unless he wanted to be seen.

155
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,878
You think he's a stalking horse

156
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,616
to trick us into revealing our position?

157
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,142
What makes you so sure?

158
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,686
Because it's exactly what I would do.

159
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,605
And I'm one of them.

160
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,997
I found their trail. Search in delta configuration.

161
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,041
- But search on foot. <i>- Why?</i>

162
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,435
<i>We don't care about the others.</i>

163
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,919
But she does.

164
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,796
She's with them on the ground.

165
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,631
That's where we look.

166
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,384
Hey, Vix, ain't this supposed to be your territory?

167
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,220
Use some of your animal tricks to give us a leg up.

168
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,548
What makes you think I know anything about the jungle?

169
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,600
- I live in a loft in Chelsea. <i>- We're going to split up.</i>

170
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,039
We'll each try to find Paran Dul's ship

171
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,731
and use her radio to contact the Watchtower for help.

172
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,109
Be a lot easier without all them birdfolk in the way.

173
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,821
- We should thin the herd first. - We'll do it my way.

174
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,156
You're still loyal to them, aren't you?

175
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:07,119
- She ain't loyal to nobody. - It's not about loyalty.

176
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:10,080
I understand them. I understand how they feel.

177
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,124
Well, ma'am, all this understanding

178
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,500
is liable to get us killed.

179
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,168
I'm not going to argue with you.

180
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,130
- I'm in charge. You have to... - What? Trust you?

181
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:21,383
- Seems to me that's been tried. - Vig, we can't do this now.

182
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:25,220
- She's mission leader. - She's a Thanagarian.

183
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,031
I don't know what you did during the invasion...

184
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:28,473
- I fought them. - So did I.

185
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,392
For all the good it done me.

186
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,436
Filthy hawks caught me.

187
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,939
Locked me up in a tiny cell, humiliated me.

188
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,358
Your people, Hawkgirl.

189
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,527
I've told you not to call me...

190
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,572
- You've been hit. <i>- I was in a fight, remember?</i>

191
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,533
- Why didn't you say anything? - Didn't wanna raise no fuss.

192
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,329
If you don't trust me, you shouldn't have to follow me.

193
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,122
I'm going to take Paran Dul's offer.

194
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,042
Turn yourself in? We've been through this already.

195
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,586
What do you care? I'm just a filthy hawk, right?

196
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,715
When I look at myself...

197
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:04,634
Maybe I owe my people the chance to pass judgment on me.

198
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,429
You know, for the last few months, all I've been hearing is

199
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:10,390
"Shayera's so brave." "Shayera's so tough."

200
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,934
- "Shayera never quits." - Vixen.

201
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,330
I'm embarrassed to say that I was maybe a little jealous

202
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,273
of you, but seeing you in action here...

203
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,751
I'm thinking John must have been talking

204
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,401
about some other Shayera.

205
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,779
We're in this together. That's how it's done.

206
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,558
You took Commander Talek from us, Shayera.

207
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,771
And your friend, the green one, did something to my mind.

208
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,398
Something bad.

209
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,402
I miss Commander Talek.

210
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,655
I miss being able to think without pain.

211
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:10,117
But no one's going to miss you.

212
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:37,227
I got plenty for these two. Get Vigilante out of here.

213
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,439
- I won't leave you by yourself. - I'm right behind you.

214
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,441
I'll ditch as soon as you guys are clear.

215
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:50,073
You're wasting your time.

216
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,451
Right now, it's like an elephant is sitting on your...

217
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,504
Wait, wait. Don't shoot, please.

218
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,673
I can't think of a good reason not to.

219
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,427
Because I can give you Shayera Hol. You still want her?

220
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,952
I'm supposed to believe you would give me your teammate?

221
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,770
I'm brain-damaged, not stupid.

222
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,899
My animal senses are 100 times more acute than yours.

223
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:27,027
- I could find her with ease. - And why would you want to?

224
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,613
You mean besides saving myself?

225
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:33,283
<i>Shayera and I, we want the same man.</i>

226
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,620
- Enough of this. - Wait. I believe her.

227
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:42,000
Lead the way.

228
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,253
Either of you got a med kit?

229
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,048
We've got an analgesic projective back in the ship.

230
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:49,883
After you help us.

231
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,777
If you want me in condition to track someone

232
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,471
over this terrain, you'll take me to it right now.

233
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,972
Do it.

234
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,487
This will kill the pain.

235
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,369
You'll be needing that when you wake up.

236
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,209
J'onn, it's Vixen. Can you hear me? Over.

237
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:28,046
<i>Barely. Increase your HM Gain. Over.</i>

238
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,941
We've been ambushed by a bunch of Thanagarians

239
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,093
who have a serious mad-on for Shayera. Over.

240
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,220
J'onn? J'onn?

241
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,391
I don't think he heard you, human.

242
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,478
She's taking too long. I'm going back for her.

243
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,898
Only reason she ain't back, the hawks got her.

244
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,168
You already know that, so where are you really going?

245
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,152
Where I should have gone in the first place.

246
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,521
Maybe they'll let her go if I give them what they want.

247
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,907
Dagnabbit, girl. I ain't gonna allow it.

248
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,868
You're not really in a position to stop me, are you, cowboy?

249
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,582
Please.

250
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,795
The Justice League is bound to send a search party

251
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,256
in a day or two. Stay safe.

252
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,262
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

253
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,569
Appears that you've got the drop on me, partner.

254
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:38,366
May have spoke prematurely on that.

255
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,493
Now you and me are gonna have a little confab

256
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,954
concerning the location of your spaceship.

257
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,794
Would you care to surrender now, or shall I have Kragger do

258
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,255
<i>something unseemly to your friend?</i>

259
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,008
Let her go and I'm yours, no tricks.

260
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:58,970
I'm sure. Drop your mace and we have a deal.

261
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,315
No!

262
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,030
Who's flying my ship?

263
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:18,698
<i>Consarned, dang-busted, horse-thievin'</i>

264
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,117
alien control panel which can't nobody work proper.

265
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,205
<i>I'm comin', darlin'!</i>

266
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,378
<i>Yee-ha!</i>

267
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,342
Shayera!

268
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:59,906
You folks mind? Doomed driver up here!

269
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,832
You took everything from me. Destroy you! Destroy you!

270
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,357
- You okay? - I will be if you let me drive.

271
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,218
Need a lift?

272
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,866
I was worried about you.

273
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,371
- When do you wanna do this? - No time like the present.

274
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,958
Mari. Shayera?

275
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,879
Oh, man! This is gonna be ugly.

276
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,179
Not to mention his taste in movies.

277
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:49,849
I know! "Old Yeller"? What's that about?

278
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,230
And he's such a marine.

279
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:57,106
You should see his underwear drawer.

280
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,234
He folds his socks.

281
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,572
I have seen his underwear drawer.

282
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,701
He still has feelings for you, you know.

283
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,120
- I know. - Is it mutual?

284
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,499
What's not to love?

285
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,418
Funny thing about me.

286
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,755
Whenever I start a book or a movie, no matter how bad it is

287
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,883
I just can't stop until I get to the end.

288
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,177
<i>So even though John and I have only been together</i>

289
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,679
for a little while...

290
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,599
Well, I just like to see things through.

291
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,017
<i>En garde.</i>
