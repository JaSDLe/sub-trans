1
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>In the Caribbean, the San Vacaro Volcano</i>

2
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,441
<i>went active during the night</i>

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,777
<i>sending a cloud of ash miles into the air.</i>

4
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,071
Geologists predict a devastating eruption

5
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,739
sometime within the week.

6
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,634
Sources report the Justice League has offered

7
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,537
to help the Vacaran authorities with the evacuation. 70,000...

8
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,664
Yeah, have the car ready in 20 minutes.

9
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,072
And get all the division heads

10
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:42,875
in for the meeting an hour early.

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,294
Closer to home, the political world is still reeling

12
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,380
from Lex Luthor's surprise announcement

13
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:50,341
of his candidacy for President of the United States.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,093
<i>Overnight polling among likely voters</i>

15
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,178
<i>shows Luthor to be within striking distance</i>

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,972
<i>of both major party candidates.</i>

17
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:13,614
Get dressed.

18
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,491
It's time we talked.

19
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,516
Amanda Waller. Born in East St. Louis.

20
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,769
Rhodes scholar, PhD in political science.

21
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:27,229
Served in intelligence under three administrations.

22
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,690
Disappeared from public life four years ago.

23
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,442
Am I supposed to be impressed?

24
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,236
Maybe I should rattle off your resume now.

25
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,365
You know, I could blow the whistle on you anytime I want.

26
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:40,409
Fine. Why don't we step into the light together?

27
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,970
I'm sure the American people will be

28
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,705
just as interested in your activities as mine.

29
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,958
Secret weapons, illegal cloning experiments.

30
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,503
- Bypassing Congress. - What do you want?

31
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,838
I want to know what you think you're doing.

32
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,175
Did Superman ever mention that to get Luthor's pardon

33
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,638
he had to tell us about your parallel universe adventure?

34
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,056
All about it?

35
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:03,891
<i>We started to wonder what would happen</i>

36
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,727
<i>if you took the same action that the Justice Lords did.</i>

37
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:11,023
So I had my people run some computer simulations.

38
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,943
If the Justice League ever went rogue

39
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,862
what do you think would be the result?

40
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,073
- That's moot. - Humor me.

41
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:22,910
In every single scenario you beat us... badly.

42
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,870
But that was before Cadmus.

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,624
Now we have the technology to defend ourselves.

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,459
Whatever you think you're doing

45
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,878
if you present a threat to the world

46
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,173
the Justice League will take you down.

47
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,300
If <i>we</i> present a threat?

48
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,302
You've got a spaceship floating over our heads

49
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,346
with a laser weapon pointing down.

50
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,973
In another dimension, seven of you

51
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,224
overthrew the government

52
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,976
and assassinated the President.

53
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,686
We're the good guys.

54
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:52,773
Protecting our country from a very real threat.

55
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,982
You.

56
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,249
<i>How long is this gonna take?</i>

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,209
I thought we had an island to evacuate.

58
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,794
First team's already down there.

59
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,483
We'll join them as soon as we're done.

60
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,826
<i>I want to hear what you learned.</i>

61
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,257
Project Cadmus is in the business

62
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,592
of developing weapons

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,469
specifically to fight us.

64
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,262
They're worried we've grown too powerful

65
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,711
and they want to even the odds.

66
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,265
Exactly.

67
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,034
They were behind that business with the Ultramen

68
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,226
<i>and the Supergirl clone.</i>

69
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,228
Galatea will be fully recovered soon

70
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,022
and ready to return to active duty.

71
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,315
And the Doomsday weapon?

72
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:35,523
<i>Considering the damage</i>

73
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,566
<i>done to its frontal lobe</i>

74
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,818
<i>the cellular regeneration</i>

75
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,779
has been remarkable.

76
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,322
Its EEG's are still flat.

77
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,324
Nonetheless, we're monitoring it closely.

78
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:44,532
<i>Keep me updated.</i>

79
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,993
<i>Tala, have you developed</i>

80
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,536
<i>a plan to retrieve the armor?</i>

81
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,705
We've come up with some promising scenarios

82
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,373
but they're going to require

83
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>certain additional resources.</i>

84
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,461
<i>Fine. See me after.</i>

85
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:56,921
What are they so worried about?

86
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,798
We'd never try to take over like that.

87
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:01,550
The Justice Lords did in their dimension.

88
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,178
- What's to stop us? - Me.

89
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,430
Those guys went overboard because their Flash died.

90
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,266
So as long as you all focus on keeping me alive

91
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,061
that'll never happen here.

92
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,022
Let's put a pin in that theory to explore another time.

93
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,440
I've seen the federal budget.

94
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,609
There's no funding for a Project Cadmus.

95
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,277
Where's the money coming from?

96
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,279
We're all thinking the same thing.

97
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,241
- Luthor. - The obvious suspect.

98
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,118
He funded General Hardcastle's rogue operations.

99
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,787
But if he's bankrolling Cadmus

100
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,995
he's doing an excellent job of covering his tracks.

101
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,724
I've got the Question looking into it...

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,168
Not that kook.

103
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,504
I admit he's wound a bit too tightly

104
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,339
but if anyone can find a hidden link

105
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,967
from Luthor to Cadmus, he's the man.

106
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,510
In the meantime, I'll be following

107
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:45,928
the trail from Waller's end.

108
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,682
And Dr. Milo, splicing together

109
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,017
human and animal DNA.

110
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,770
- How's that going? - I know what you're thinking.

111
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,565
But my experiments are actually quite close to paying off.

112
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,276
Dr. Langston's research has proven very useful.

113
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,194
<i>I just need a little more time</i>

114
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,572
<i>and I promise I'll have something concrete to show you.</i>

115
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,906
Concrete?

116
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,158
Like, say, the super-powered warthog

117
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,369
that tore up your lab last week?

118
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,581
Professor Hamilton's already showed me the remains.

119
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,541
That, that was just a prototype.

120
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:19,753
Dr. Milo, I'm not known for my sense of humor.

121
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,591
But I know a sick joke when I see one.

122
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,343
<i>In light of the continuing lack of results from your work</i>

123
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,053
I'm pulling your funding.

124
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,764
In accordance with the Technological Clearances Act

125
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,226
we'll set you up in a new non-vital capacity

126
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,812
and confiscate your classified research.

127
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,940
As you're well aware, any public discussion of Cadmus

128
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,111
<i>or its work will result in your immediate sanction.</i>

129
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,780
<i>And rest assured, doctor, our people will be keeping...</i>

130
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,169
You can go now.

131
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,693
I know you're faking.

132
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,030
The lobotomized portion of your brain has completely regrown.

133
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,369
Do you remember anything from before?

134
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:39,041
That's alright. I'll show you.

135
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:42,127
You've been used, and you deserve to know.

136
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,838
<i>You see, you were created from a sample</i>

137
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,174
<i>of Superman's genetic material.</i>

138
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,469
<i>But your DNA was altered to make you his superior.</i>

139
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,890
<i>And then you were trained to hate him.</i>

140
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,478
<i>You were conditioned, humiliated...</i>

141
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,648
<i>repeatedly injured.</i>

142
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,988
<i>But not by Superman.</i>

143
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,908
By Amanda Waller and Professor Emile Hamilton.

144
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,246
When you became uncontrollable, they tried to dispose of you.

145
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:20,624
<i>They put you in a rocket and shot you into space.</i>

146
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,465
<i>But you were too strong.</i>

147
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,513
<i>Your struggles threw the rocket off course.</i>

148
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,475
<i>And it came back to Earth.</i>

149
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:43,355
When you landed, you fought a different Superman

150
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,649
one from a parallel universe.

151
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,860
He lobotomized you.

152
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,947
- Superman. - Yes. Good.

153
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,782
But he isn't your enemy.

154
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,368
Your hatred of him was manufactured.

155
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,204
At every turn, Waller and Hamilton

156
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,331
abused and betrayed you

157
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,209
just as they betrayed me.

158
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,463
Don't we both deserve retribution?

159
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,506
Yes. Release me.

160
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,675
And you'll solve both our problems?

161
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,010
Yes.

162
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,813
What are you...

163
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,231
Your problem's solved.

164
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,779
Now for Superman.

165
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,594
- What's going on? - Ma'am, Doomsday's escaped.

166
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,181
Milo. I'll have his hide for this.

167
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,225
Doomsday beat you to it, ma'am.

168
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,669
Our radios are barely working.

169
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,547
I'm spending half my time running messages around.

170
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,299
It's the electromagnetic interference from the volcano.

171
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,176
Superman, how's it going in there?

172
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,595
<i>Can you read me any better than before?</i>

173
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,598
<i>You're dropping in and out. It depends on where I am.</i>

174
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,937
I'm trying to ease the pressure on the volcano.

175
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,189
If I can dig some tunnels off the main core

176
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,733
maybe I can stop the eruption before it starts.

177
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>When will you be able to tell if it's working?</i>

178
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,543
Hard to say. I could just as easily set it off.

179
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,587
<i>So I have to go slow.</i>

180
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,466
Just get everyone clear as soon as you can.

181
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,063
Superman. I'm here to kill you.

182
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,107
Is this a bad time?

183
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,850
I remember... those eyes.

184
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,026
Let's see you do that again.

185
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:29,665
I know who you are.

186
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,583
But I'm not the one who hurt you.

187
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,462
Superman is Superman, and I will kill you.

188
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,671
Why?

189
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,755
It's what I am.

190
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,466
I don't care why.

191
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,055
GPS puts the stolen pod on San Vacaro.

192
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,391
Doomsday went right back after Superman.

193
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,018
I love a well-conditioned soldier.

194
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,729
And what will your soldier do after he's killed Superman?

195
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,439
We can't leave him loose.

196
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,929
For all we know, he'll try to kill everyone on the planet.

197
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,362
He has to be stopped before he leaves that island!

198
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,589
But how am I supposed to...

199
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,615
I don't care! Get it done!

200
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,498
This is Eiling. Authorization firewall.

201
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,338
Target locked. Package is ready.

202
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,547
Deliver the package.

203
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,730
zip

204
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,824
Superman, give me an update.

205
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,286
<i>Uh! Something's come up! Huh!</i>

206
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,332
Just keep doing what you're doing.

207
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,926
Where are you? I'll come help!

208
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,264
No! Stay with the evacuation. This isn't important.

209
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,266
Getting those people to safety is!

210
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,649
Move it out!

211
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,320
Another transport just landed on the mainland.

212
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:24,696
They're over half done.

213
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:30,827
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

214
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,204
<i>It's a nuclear missile</i>

215
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,747
<i>headed straight for San Vacaro.</i>

216
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,123
And from the spectrograph

217
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,732
its warhead's lined with kryptonite.

218
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,210
Can we hit it from up here?

219
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:40,754
No. It's moving too fast. But who fired it?

220
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,137
Yes, Mr. President?

221
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,347
<i>Call off the missile.</i>

222
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,723
How did you get this number?

223
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,309
<i>The missile headed for San Vacaro.</i>

224
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>If anyone dies on that island today</i>

225
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,105
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

226
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,649
You do what you have to and so will I.

227
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,236
Eiling!

228
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:05,444
She didn't know.

229
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,570
Captain Atom's on his way

230
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,614
from Southern California.

231
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,063
His top speed's under Mach two.

232
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,575
He'll never get there in time.

233
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,413
Hey!

234
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,292
Clear the hangar! Now!

235
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,762
<i>Initiating emergency drop in three, two, one.</i>

236
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,275
<i>Batman, you're going too fast.</i>

237
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,444
if I let the Earth's gravity accelerate me

238
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,487
I should reach intercept in two minutes.

239
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,947
<i>If you don't burn up on entry.</i>

240
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,626
What were you thinking?

241
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,546
You're gonna kill Superman and everyone else on the island!

242
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:05,881
We have to sanction Doomsday

243
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,257
we were gonna get to Superman

244
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,651
somewhere down the line, and we've been

245
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:09,759
trying to stop drug traffic

246
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,678
from San Vacaro for years.

247
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,764
The way I see it, three birds, one stone.

248
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,600
Call it off.

249
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,894
Anti-abort safeties have already engaged.

250
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:21,229
I couldn't stop it now if I wanted to.

251
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,057
Wham

252
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,992
<i>Wonder Woman, can you hear me?</i>

253
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,803
<i>There's a missile with a kryptonite warhead</i>

254
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:18,954
<i>heading for your position.</i>

255
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:20,162
Say again.

256
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,325
Repeat, there's a kryptonite

257
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:22,456
missile heading your way.

258
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,499
Can you read me?

259
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,674
Flash, get everyone as far away as you can.

260
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,217
I'm going back for Superman.

261
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,760
- But... - Do it now!

262
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:52,320
The missile's armed with magnetic repulsers.

263
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,699
The only way past that is with the javelin itself.

264
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,617
You could give the hull an opposing charge.

265
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,826
<i>Understood.</i>

266
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,833
Batman?

267
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,543
<i>Batman, come in.</i>

268
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:19,741
Uh, uh, uh. Can't beat me the same way twice.

269
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,369
Then I guess I'll need a bigger fire.

270
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,586
Did Cadmus create you?

271
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:18,925
J'onn?

272
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,886
I can't read his mind.

273
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,638
His brain's been altered to resist me.

274
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,087
You don't owe anything to them.

275
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:26,181
They manipulated you

276
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,392
and then tried to kill you.

277
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,145
- So I keep hearing. - From who?

278
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:34,190
All you need to know is that I will get free...

279
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,609
and I will kill you.

280
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,695
If that's your final word.

281
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,534
I only use this as a last resort.

282
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,619
It's gonna send you to another dimension.

283
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,039
You won't be hurt, but you also won't hurt anyone else again.

284
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,083
You'll wish you'd killed me.

285
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,231
He'll do anything to avoid monitor duty.

286
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,442
Sent him off to the phantom zone, didn't you?

287
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,902
He left us no choice.

288
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,321
Spoken like a true Justice Lord.

289
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:22,822
What? Come on.

290
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,866
Passing judgment like Gods?

291
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:28,453
With our super-powered army and our orbiting death ray?

292
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,455
Cadmus is right to be scared.

293
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,373
The human race wouldn't stand a chance.

294
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,750
We'd never go there.

295
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,958
It isn't in our nature

296
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,377
and nothing can change that.

297
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,046
Nothing?

298
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,881
What if Luthor does become President

299
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,424
like he did in their world?

300
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,385
What would stop you from doing what that Superman did?

301
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,888
There's always that kryptonite you carry around.

302
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,932
You don't get to joke!

303
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,517
Not today.

304
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:52,560
I just took a bullet for you.

305
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,899
I'm sorry, Bruce. You're right.

306
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,085
But you don't have to worry about the Justice League.

307
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:02,654
Trust me. You know me.

308
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,989
Yeah. I do.

309
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,409
Get some rest.
