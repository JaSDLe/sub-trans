1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,676
<i>That's never going to work.</i>

2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,470
When did the Greeks ever use

3
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:15,473
precipitate of bismuth in their potions?

4
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,141
The Greeks didn't.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,561
But I'm making a counter-potion, remember?

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,863
<i>And you actually believe that pathetic concoction</i>

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,242
will be enough to remove the annihilators vulnerability?

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,454
Shh! Be quiet, Felix. I'm trying to concentrate.

9
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:43,084
Tala, you've come a long way since my untimely demise.

10
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,169
But the student, however gifted

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,547
still has much to learn from the teacher.

12
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,007
Maybe I wouldn't if we had spent

13
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,343
more time on curriculum and less time...

14
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,054
And this, from the woman

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,723
who once braved the gates of Tartarus itself

16
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,892
to collect my mortal remains?

17
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,312
Right, and I'm supposed to take advice from you

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,399
when without my spell, your spirit would have been...

19
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:09,151
lost in the winds.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,738
Yes, uh, so very kind of you to trap me in this mirror

21
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,532
for all eternity.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,702
- Beats the alternative. - True enough.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,662
Still, it's hard to believe

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,540
you can't solve your annihilator problem.

25
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:25,293
The answer's simplicity itself.

26
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,797
Are you going to tell me or just keep tormenting me?

27
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,967
No, no, repeat after me.

28
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:35,928
By the power of Zeus, free his essence from this vessel

29
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,680
and open the path to power.

30
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,432
By the power of Zeus

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,475
free his essence from this vessel

32
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,020
and open the path to power.

33
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,943
That didn't do any... thing.

34
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,154
Surprise, sweetheart.

35
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,452
Felix, wait!

36
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,458
This is really bad, isn't it?

37
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,960
You have no idea.

38
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,811
Uh-h-h!

39
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,388
This was a great idea, Wally.

40
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,740
I can't remember the last time

41
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,004
we've had a chance to catch up.

42
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,058
Mostly my fault.

43
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,747
I've been pretty busy in Central City.

44
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,103
I want to hear all about it.

45
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,431
I saw some of it on the news

46
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:51,939
but it's not the same as...

47
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,108
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:56,068
I thought we were having dinner tonight.

49
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,946
Is it Tuesday? Silly me.

50
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,875
Making dinner plans with two beautiful women

51
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,073
on the same night.

52
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,200
Uh-huh.

53
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,994
We can do this another time.

54
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,412
Don't be ridiculous.

55
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,205
We can all have a meal together.

56
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,208
It's a chance for us to get reacquainted, patch things up.

57
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,336
Assuming we want to.

58
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,006
Now, there's an example of exactly the kind of thing

59
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:19,550
we're not gonna do anymore, right?

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,677
I'm tellin' you, once we clear the air

61
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,804
everybody's gonna be pals again.

62
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,741
I always thought the reason you two don't get along

63
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,932
is that you're so much alike.

64
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,559
Like her?

65
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,192
You weren't gonna eat that, were you?

66
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,073
You guys aren't even trying.

67
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,201
You could at least talk to each other.

68
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,289
The pasta's good.

69
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,500
It's the sauce.

70
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,713
- This isn't gonna work, is it? - Not a chance.

71
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,758
Hey, where you going? Come on.

72
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,555
I had dinner with two women at the same time.

73
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,682
Because I'm a stud.

74
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,660
Etrigan, calm yourself. Let me help you.

75
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,746
The gates of Tartarus swing both ways.

76
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,500
The balance tips towards chaos.

77
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,673
<i>- Usurper! - Fiend!</i>

78
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,970
- What's happening here? - I don't know.

79
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,472
Suddenly all of our members with magical powers...

80
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,015
Well, you can see.

81
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,943
They're in agony. What can we do?

82
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:02,151
I'm researching.

83
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,380
As soon as I learn something

84
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,572
I'll let you know.

85
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
Uh-h-h.

86
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,665
<i>Flash!</i>

87
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,210
No, no, it's the original speedster.

88
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,254
Hey, Diana, I let myself in.

89
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:23,465
Hermes. How may I serve the messenger of the Gods?

90
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,009
Don't be so formal, Diana.

91
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,386
You're practically a member of the family.

92
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,680
Not that this is a social visit.

93
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,058
I've got something for you here. It's-it's pretty important.

94
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,936
Zeus paid for overnight service. Here it is.

95
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,858
"For a good time call Podenimus."

96
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,401
Wrong scroll.

97
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,819
I think I got a shot.

98
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,614
It's her cell number.

99
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,907
Here we go.

100
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,117
"By decree of Zeus, father of Olympus

101
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,952
it is so ordered

102
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,539
Diana of Themyscira will travel to Tartarus

103
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,667
and set right that which has been disturbed."

104
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,253
- He's telling me to go to... - Basically.

105
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,255
<i>Felix Faust is on the loose again.</i>

106
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,965
Felix Faust is dead.

107
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,176
Yes, and pretty upset about it too.

108
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,553
<i>His spirit possessed a powerful weapon</i>

109
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,388
<i>called the annihilator.</i>

110
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,100
<i>Then headed straight for the gates of Tartarus.</i>

111
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,227
<i>I mean, straight for it.</i>

112
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,857
<i>The Amazons did their best to stop him.</i>

113
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,568
<i>They're good, but they were out of their weight class.</i>

114
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,367
<i>Once inside, he went looking for Hades</i>

115
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:34,161
<i>the master of Tartarus.</i>

116
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,498
Guess Faust is still torqued.

117
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,501
Hades messed him over pretty good a few years back.

118
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,379
- I was there. - And you'll be there this time.

119
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:44,964
You must defeat Faust

120
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,967
and restore Hades to the the throne of Tartarus.

121
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,719
So far as I'm concerned, they deserve each other.

122
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,596
Why should I care about this?

123
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,516
You mean, other than the direct order from the Gods thing?

124
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,018
Because, you know, there must always be balance

125
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,853
between chaos and order.

126
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,480
When there isn't...

127
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,816
you've been to the infirmary already, right?

128
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,067
My friends.

129
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,944
Need you to do the right thing.

130
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,029
They're in good hands, Diana.

131
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,238
Yours.

132
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,429
Shayera?

133
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,014
Security override.

134
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:37,433
User code 0-0-3.

135
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:39,435
<i>User identity Wonder Woman.</i>

136
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,520
- <i>Confirmed.</i> - Unlock this door.

137
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,250
Something I can help you with?

138
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,087
Look, I need it. I'll bring it back.

139
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,673
We become pals while I wasn't looking?

140
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,676
There's trouble on Themyscira. Mystical trouble.

141
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,345
Your mace disrupts magic. I thought...

142
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,274
Whatever's happening on that island of yours

143
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,683
must be pretty bad for you to resort to this.

144
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,686
Life and death. Can I have it?

145
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,150
It's a package deal.

146
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:30,277
You want the mace, you get me too.

147
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,093
You're doing this because you want to

148
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,786
prove yourself to me, aren't you?

149
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:42,164
Well, you don't have to. I forgave you a long time ago.

150
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,291
Did I ever ask you for your forgiveness?

151
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,018
Drive them back, sisters.

152
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,320
Diana, you know you're not supposed to set foot

153
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,781
on this island. The Gods have decreed that...

154
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:19,201
The Gods are decreeing stuff all the time around here...

155
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,619
ma'am.

156
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,291
I have to go into Tartarus and stop all of this.

157
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,876
I won't allow it.

158
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,754
Neither of us has any choice in the matter, mother.

159
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,673
Wait, if you are to attempt such a feat

160
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,008
you must have access to your full power.

161
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,012
Because you stole your armor and lasso

162
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,682
you were never told of all the powers they possess.

163
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,232
When the time comes you'll know everything you need to know.

164
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,779
- Bring my daughter back to me. - Nothing to worry about.

165
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,948
She's almost as good at kicking butt as I am.

166
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,270
It's getting kind of hot in here.

167
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,939
Considering where we are?

168
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,151
Point taken, but still.

169
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,077
That's right, I'm an angel.

170
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,871
You can mess with me if you want to

171
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,582
but I don't think you want to mess with the boss.

172
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,839
If we're lucky, they'll all be that dumb.

173
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,016
We need a way to find Faust.

174
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,685
Faust? We should free Hades first.

175
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,687
Hades can take care of himself.

176
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,232
- I'm not here to help him. - You're not?

177
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,733
Then what are you here for?

178
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,194
- You know what I mean. - I really don't.

179
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,405
You told me our mission is to put Hades back on the throne.

180
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,200
Whatever he's guilty of, we've still got a job to do.

181
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,202
You wouldn't say that if you'd been there.

182
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,538
If you'd seen what he tried to do to my mother, to me.

183
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,457
Be practical, we're going to need Hades

184
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,000
to help take Faust down.

185
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,835
I don't even need <i>your</i> help.

186
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,295
Yes, you do.

187
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,216
I can't make this decision for you, Diana

188
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:42,261
but however you want to play it, I'll back you up.

189
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,930
Then it's Faust.

190
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,723
The only problem is finding him.

191
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,433
Oh, that's not a problem.

192
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,420
- Give it to me! - Give it to me now!

193
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,603
Where's Faust?

194
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,398
Let me think. Oh, yeah, he's over there.

195
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:39,776
No, wait, he's over there. No, there.

196
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,279
One more answer and it better be the right one.

197
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,740
Or what? You'll kill me?

198
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,700
Gosh, I might end up suffering

199
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:50,037
eternal torment as punishment for my sins.

200
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,497
Oh, wait, I already am!

201
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,085
<i>Let me try.</i>

202
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,464
Tell me your name.

203
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:01,757
Abnaguzar.

204
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,176
<i>Tell me where to find Faust, Abnaguzar.</i>

205
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,094
In Hades' library.

206
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,138
- Lead us there. - Okay.

207
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,313
How'd you do that?

208
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,148
Magic lasso. Who knew?

209
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,484
If you don't want to tell me, fine.

210
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,118
Not yet. I've got one more question.

211
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,162
Is there anything else we should know?

212
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,457
Yeah, you really, really shouldn't go in there.

213
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:38,710
Now, could you please take this rope off of me?

214
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,588
I'm a demon. The truth hurts.

215
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,822
Whoa!

216
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Shh.

217
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,133
Incredible.

218
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,301
Wouldn't you agree, princess?

219
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,721
"The Lost Scrolls of Herculaneum"

220
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,890
Merlin's "Juvenilia"

221
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,935
Pierre Menard's <i>"Don Quixote."</i>

222
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,604
Dark tomes that make "The Necronomicon"

223
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,690
look like a children's book.

224
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,650
There's enough <i>arcana</i> here to quench

225
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,986
even my thirst for knowledge.

226
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:49,364
At least for the next 5,000 years or so.

227
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,451
Why would anybody bother taking over this dump?

228
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,204
To get revenge on Hades for betraying me.

229
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,832
I planned to torture him for a few millennia

230
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,834
but Hades tried to make a deal.

231
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,252
He told me about this place.

232
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,087
He kept his end of the bargain

233
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,882
but I didn't keep mine.

234
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,259
I still don't understand why he was surprised.

235
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:14,097
But now I'm in heaven, figuratively speaking.

236
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,933
We're revoking your library card.

237
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,979
Oh, you want to fight. Not in the mood.

238
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,239
Darn. Lost my place.

239
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,713
- You okay? - Yeah.

240
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,424
Didn't think I'd need a jacket where we were going.

241
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,176
Aren't you cold in that outfit?

242
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,512
- Not really. - Of course not.

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,555
The princess doesn't get cold.

244
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,184
The princess doesn't even sweat in the fire pits of Tartarus.

245
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:00,602
I do, too, sweat.

246
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,437
Please. You glow.

247
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,486
I wouldn't be surprised if you never have to...

248
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,743
Get off of him!

249
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,960
Did Faust send you?

250
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,587
Did he decide the vultures weren't enough?

251
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,673
They aren't enough, monster.

252
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,808
It appears I'm in your debt, my child.

253
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,978
Thank the Gods, Hades. If it were up to me...

254
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:44,771
But even here there has to be order.

255
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,607
Faust doesn't care what happens to this place.

256
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,944
No one ever appreciates your work until you're gone.

257
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,863
Come on. We're putting you back on the throne.

258
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,574
Or die trying?

259
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:56,782
Not in the plan.

260
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:13,675
My books!

261
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,899
This time I'll leave nothing of you behind to torture.

262
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,162
Give up, Faust.

263
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,663
I know the secret of the armor.

264
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,540
It's fueled by rage.

265
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,834
If we don't fight you, you're powerless.

266
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,048
That was before I fixed it.

267
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:54,256
Good to know.

268
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,090
My mace disrupts magic.

269
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,384
What's that tin suit run on, again?

270
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:50,021
You actually hurt me.

271
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,607
Allow me to return the favor.

272
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,651
I hit a lot harder than she does.

273
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,214
Shayera?

274
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,595
Your mace protected me from the worst of the explosion

275
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,139
but I was afraid you...

276
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:25,932
You're all sweaty.

277
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,934
Told you.

278
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,771
Ah, well, who has time to read these days?

279
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:37,026
Besides, I've got a new hobby.

280
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,196
Tormenting Faust's pathetic soul.

281
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,865
Any problems with that?

282
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:43,491
Not my department.

283
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,119
- <i>And you, my child?</i> - Have a party.

284
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,288
But don't call me "my child" again

285
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,123
or you'll get what he got.

286
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:53,376
Your mother never told you, did she?

287
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,128
Weren't you ever the least bit curious

288
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:58,339
about your father's identity?

289
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,049
I don't have a father.

290
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,969
My mother sculpted me from clay and breathed life into me.

291
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,222
Your mother and I sculpted you together.

292
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,891
When I met you a few years ago

293
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,351
I realized Hippolyta must have brought you to life

294
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,605
sometime after I was condemned to Tartarus.

295
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:16,107
As a reminder of me, perhaps.

296
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,526
He's lying, Diana. We can prove it.

297
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,446
Use the lasso on him. Make him tell the truth.

298
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:24,657
The real truth is, it doesn't matter.

299
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,409
I know what I need to know.

300
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,120
I know who raised me and I know what I was raised to do.

301
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,097
Thank you for unlocking my armor's powers.

302
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,786
I might not have made it without them.

303
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,352
You earned them a long time ago.

304
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,313
I was too stubborn to admit it.

305
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,942
- I'd better go. - Stay and rest for your trip.

306
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,153
At the very least, you and your friend can share a meal with me.

307
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,864
But I've been banished. The Gods...

308
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,951
This is your home and I'm your mother.

309
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,452
If the Gods don't like it

310
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,496
they'll have to take it up with me.

311
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,837
What about us? Are we good?

312
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,964
Like oil and vinegar.

313
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,466
We go together, but we don't mix.

314
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,676
Works for me.
