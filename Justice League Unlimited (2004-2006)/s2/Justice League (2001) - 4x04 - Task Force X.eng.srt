1
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,975
There's still time, Mr. Lawton.

2
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,353
Are you sure you don't want me to pray for you?

3
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,356
I'm sure.

4
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:26,651
But if it comforts you, <i>padre,</i> by all means.

5
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,532
Huh. My chair's already taken.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,784
Guess we'll have to come back tomorrow.

7
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,744
Who are you? What is this?

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,914
You can't just come in here...

9
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,711
- Release the prisoner. - But...

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,755
Release him!

11
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,078
What if I don't want to go with you?

12
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,557
Then you can go and take your seat, tough guy.

13
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:03,688
<i>So what do I call you?</i>

14
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,774
The name's Flagg. Colonel Flagg.

15
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,694
Colonel... Flagg?

16
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,737
You're kidding, right?

17
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,950
Before you do something stupid

18
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,536
tell me, how did you enjoy your last meal?

19
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:19,912
Not bad.

20
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,581
The asparagus was a little overcooked

21
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,791
but the lobster was perfect.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,377
<i>It was laced with explosive nanites.</i>

23
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,337
- Excuse me. - That's right.

24
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,090
Any escape attempt and, well, you're gonna look kinda funny

25
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,050
tryin' to run away with no head.

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,760
That's a lot of trouble to go to

27
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,471
just to keep little old me around.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,348
What do you want exactly?

29
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,393
You're gonna do something patriotic, convict.

30
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,103
Groovy. Who do I kill?

31
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,272
Nobody, if the plan works.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,524
But if it doesn't, I need someone who can adapt

33
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,526
and overcome in a tight situation.

34
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,945
An expert with nothing to lose.

35
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,364
This must be some nasty business.

36
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,576
A little B and E, a little grand larceny, no big deal.

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,786
Right. What's the target?

38
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,833
<i>Justice League Headquarters.</i>

39
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,712
Always did wanna die for my country.

40
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:21,075
You know, this might not be the best place to talk.

41
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:24,453
Our friends up in the sky have very good ears and eyes.

42
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,122
Not a problem, convict.

43
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,808
The previous tenant had to leave in a hurry

44
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,542
<i>but he was pretty good about security.</i>

45
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,669
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot...

46
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,798
meet Task Force X.

47
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,426
<i>George Harkness, aka Captain Boomerang.</i>

48
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,219
<i>Expert thief and inventor.</i>

49
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,596
<i>Temple Fugate, the Clock King.</i>

50
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,976
<i>Planner, tactician, expert with locks and systems infiltration.</i>

51
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:50,438
<i>And Bette Sans Sushi, current alias Plastique.</i>

52
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,897
<i>Explosives expert.</i>

53
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,941
Mmm. I know.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,527
I've seen the pictures.

55
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,280
And that's all you're gonna see, killer.

56
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:00,823
Enough of this now.

57
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,831
Let's get stuck into the business at hand, eh?

58
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,619
Agreed. Time is of the essence.

59
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:10,082
It's a blooming fortress crawling with superheroes.

60
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,051
Even if we do get in, what chance do we have?

61
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,687
<i>- That's what I wanna know. - Yeah, you got that right.</i>

62
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,713
Listen to me, we've got one advantage.

63
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,132
This tower's so big and there's so much staff on it

64
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,259
no one's going to notice us.

65
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,178
Unless one of you does something stupid.

66
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,056
Once we're aboard, <i>Plastique</i> and Deadshot

67
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,559
will make their way down to the watchtower reactor

68
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,936
<i>where Plastique will create a diversion.</i>

69
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,314
Blow up a nuclear reactor?

70
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,399
- Sweet. - Do I just watch?

71
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,193
Or do I get to join in?

72
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,445
You're there to provide cover and that's all.

73
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,548
Now, at the same time, Boomer and I will make our way

74
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,701
to the package, which is kept on a storage level midway up.

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,454
Ah, so we'll make our way there pretty as you please

76
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,623
then maybe a picnic lunch, and the Justice League

77
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,541
will give us a ride home.

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,211
We may as well be storming heaven's gate itself.

79
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,255
Unlike heaven, this tower has a duty schedule.

80
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,090
One I've studied thoroughly.

81
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,385
I've scheduled your visit for when they're at their weakest.

82
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,554
Define weakest, please.

83
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,389
Just three major obstacles.

84
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,058
<i>First, Captain Atom.</i>

85
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,977
<i>His abilities include flight, super strength</i>

86
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>and absorption of radioactivity.</i>

87
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:17,733
<i>Green Lantern, his power ring enables him to create objects</i>

88
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,401
<i>by thinking about them.</i>

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,571
<i>Then there's J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter.</i>

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,906
What about him?

91
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,574
Super strength. Flight.

92
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,702
And he's a shape shifter, and he can read minds.

93
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,246
I've run into him before.

94
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:32,122
The chair's starting

95
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:34,166
to look better every minute.

96
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,297
Okay, <i>Plastique,</i> you're setting the charge

97
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,217
and Superman walks in the room.

98
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,760
You said he wouldn't be there.

99
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,449
Last-minute change in the duty roster.

100
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,681
Superman's got the drop on you. What do you do?

101
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,350
Before or after I change my shorts?

102
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,104
Yes, very amusing.

103
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,731
You have three-tenths of a second to respond.

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,567
What do you do?

105
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:02,069
I grab a hostage and threaten to blow him to Uranus

106
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,530
if big blue doesn't back off.

107
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:05,948
How's that sound?

108
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,659
- No unnecessary killing. - Oh, come on.

109
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,953
You kill someone, they find the body, sound the alarm

110
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,371
and we're trapped.

111
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,700
Or you take the time to hide

112
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,541
the body so they don't find it.

113
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:18,377
Time we don't have to waste.

114
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,298
Speaking of the time.

115
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:23,966
Plenty of time to sleep in the grave.

116
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,527
Which is where we could all wind up

117
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,553
if just one of us misses his mark.

118
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,578
Why was he wearing Booster Gold's pants?

119
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,539
So Jimmy says, "Because he left his long underwear

120
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,916
at the cleaners."

121
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,712
Even big blue laughed at that one.

122
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,341
Well, look at this. Esposito's actually on time for a change.

123
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,069
Didn't have to drop the kids at school.

124
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,761
Memorial day. Ah!

125
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,237
Five seconds.

126
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,948
Prepare for transport.

127
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,950
Copy that. You heard the man.

128
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,576
We're on the clock.

129
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,673
Yeah, yeah, it's awe-inspiring

130
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,883
but I got a schedule to keep here.

131
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:00,771
Oh, for the love of...

132
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,357
Second time this week this hunk-a-junk's gone out.

133
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,251
You'll have to wait till tech support gets here.

134
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,361
Look, we got to get a move on. We're late.

135
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,030
Tough break, pal. You know the drill.

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,959
Eh, no sweat here, as long as you're the one

137
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,826
who explains it to J'onn.

138
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,163
I thought he was gonna wet himself

139
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,999
when you mentioned the martian.

140
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,834
He couldn't let us through fast enough.

141
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,293
That was nothin'.

142
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,045
I almost lost it when this bonehead

143
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,505
set off the metal detector.

144
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,008
Seventy five cents is seventy five cents.

145
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,634
I'm supposed to throw away money?

146
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,178
Shut your mouths and get your mind on the job.

147
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,582
Sure doesn't feel like ceramics.

148
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,377
Giddyup.

149
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,592
Regular boy scout.

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,136
And you? Going in unarmed?

151
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,557
This one don't need no weapons.

152
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,741
Hey.

153
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,326
How you doin'?

154
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,504
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Lantern, for six weeks now

155
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:51,423
my wife's been after me for Hawkgirl's autograph.

156
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,675
You wouldn't know where she's at today, would you?

157
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,012
- Haven't seen her. - Okay. Thanks anyway.

158
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,017
You are a very... bad boy.

159
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,061
Tell me you didn't love it.

160
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,374
Atom Smasher?

161
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,793
No one said nothing about that bruiser, now, did they?

162
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,049
This is X-1. We've reached Checkpoint A.

163
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>You're 34 seconds behind schedule.</i>

164
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,840
Now that we're inside, we'll try to pick up the pace.

165
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,433
There's no second door on the blueprint.

166
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,769
<i>I'd get out of that corridor were I you.</i>

167
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,897
<i>There's only 41 seconds before the regular security sweep.</i>

168
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,403
- Hey, there you are. - Yeah, I had...

169
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,113
Move it, dumplin'.

170
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,574
Thirty six seconds, killer.

171
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,830
What are you doing?

172
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,457
Need that backup plan, X-4.

173
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,210
Thirty two seconds until <i>Plastique's</i> detonation.

174
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,087
- Synchronize. - Roger that.

175
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,632
X-3, you have 28 seconds. Do not be late.

176
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,634
Piece of cake, X-4.

177
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,903
Will you quit fooling around

178
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,345
with that guy?

179
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,728
Move it or lose it, killer.

180
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,653
Three, two, now!

181
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,751
- What's going on? - I don't know...

182
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>There's a breech in the reactor room.</i>

183
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,608
We're getting radiation alarms from several lower floors.

184
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592
It looks like a reactor overload.

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,976
- Crikey! - Boomer, meet the package.

186
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,353
The annihilator.

187
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,328
Calculate time needed to transport remaining personnel.

188
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:30,624
Begin sealing bulkheads on lower levels to contain radiation.

189
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,751
Attention, all personnel.

190
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,003
<i>Evacuate the watchtower immediately.</i>

191
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,048
Head for the javelin bay or the bridge transporter deck only.

192
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,175
- This is not a drill. - Guys, come on.

193
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,554
- Captain Atom. - Already on my way.

194
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,043
I'll assess and get back to you.

195
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,308
<i>- Contain the leak if you can.</i> - Roger.

196
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:57,442
"Hephaestus mighty vessel, chosen weapon of Ares

197
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,904
arise and destroy at my command."

198
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,660
It's not working. Now we're in it.

199
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,914
What's your problem, then, mate?

200
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,000
<i>Want to go a couple of rounds?</i>

201
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:18,797
Triggered by rage. Right. I forgot.

202
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,674
Could have warned a bloke, though.

203
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,928
We wait for the others.

204
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,513
They have three minutes.

205
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,682
Are you out of your blinking head? We got to go!

206
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,355
Did I say leave? Because I meant wait.

207
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,108
Move it!

208
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,877
<i>Not gonna make it, killer.</i>

209
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,425
No-o-o!

210
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,933
It's okay, you two.

211
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,269
Just keep heading up quick as you can.

212
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,358
That was pretty much the plan, captain.

213
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,485
<i>You're at two minutes past zero.</i>

214
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:22,986
<i>You've used up your pad.</i>

215
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,113
<i>There is no longer any margin for error.</i>

216
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,785
Alright, you win. We go on without them.

217
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:36,917
Bridge. Double time.

218
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,801
Evacuation's going too slowly.

219
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:48,129
The radiation will be here before the tower's cleared.

220
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,098
We need you to use your ring to transport

221
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,600
large groups to the watchtower annexes.

222
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,977
Will do, J'onn. That's enough!

223
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,897
That vehicle's only rated for 12 passengers maximum.

224
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,982
The rest of you are with me.

225
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,947
J'onn, we have a real mess down here.

226
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:09,866
I think I can contain the leak until we get everyone clear.

227
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,452
But, J'onn, this was no accident.

228
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,129
Oops.

229
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,136
I reckon you boys have a good explanation

230
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,846
for what you're doing on A deck.

231
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,597
<i>'Tis more likely that these varlets</i>

232
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,516
are the source of our woes.

233
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,810
Can't slip anything past you.

234
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,061
Take 'em down.

235
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,849
Captain Atom, come in. Status report.

236
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:17,934
I've got the leak contained, J'onn.

237
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,978
Should have it sealed within a few minutes.

238
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,907
I'll see you on the bridge as soon as I can.

239
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,583
Huh, neat.

240
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,819
We're in.

241
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,160
Ask yourselves, is being in here

242
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,746
with me what you truly desire?

243
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,791
- Get out of the way, martian. - Allow me.

244
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:18,512
Uh-h-h...

245
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,132
Green Lantern, return to the watchtower.

246
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,092
I may need some assistance.

247
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,319
<i>Cool it, martian!</i>

248
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,574
Back off, freak show, or the meat puppet eats it.

249
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:28,832
Come here.

250
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,511
Let's go, girl.

251
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,513
I've set this for 30 seconds.

252
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,932
Plenty of time for you to disarm.

253
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,101
Or not, as the case may be.

254
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,061
<i>Not very ladylike behavior, ma'am.</i>

255
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,523
<i>Plastique!</i>

256
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,527
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

257
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,042
Tend to her.

258
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,677
They've thought of everything.

259
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,919
You really think we can do something with this?

260
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:40,280
An invulnerable juggernaut forged by the Gods?

261
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,658
Oh, yes, Ms. Waller, most definitely.

262
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,410
I heard we lost <i>Plastique.</i>

263
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:48,413
Yes, ma'am. You'll have my full report by 0800.

264
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,540
Right. That'll be all.

265
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:52,958
Rick.

266
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,004
You're a good soldier.

267
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:58,465
Your father would be proud.

268
00:20:58,673 --> 00:20:59,841
Ma'am.

269
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:08,266
Most fun I've had since my last root canal.

270
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,435
Well, gang, guess I'll be seeing...

271
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,441
Dream on, dirtbag. Five years.

272
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,027
You sign up for missions like this for five years.

273
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:21,988
If you survive, then you go free.

274
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,924
If you don't like it, there's a nice warm seat

275
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,284
waiting for you back at Belle Reve Correctional.

276
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,788
Tell me, colonel... what's Waller got on you?

277
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,123
Not a thing.

278
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,852
Some of us don't have to be blackmailed

279
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,877
into serving their country.

280
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,479
<i>How did you know Vance was the inside man?</i>

281
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,941
He was the only one on the tower whose mind I couldn't read.

282
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,609
Cadmus must have supplied him

283
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,487
with a sophisticated method of masking his thoughts.

284
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:05,073
So, what do we do with him now?

285
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,283
I'd like to go in there and wipe clean

286
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,244
the last two years of his memory.

287
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,955
Whoa. That's a little harsh, don't you think?

288
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,790
He's a liability.

289
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,208
<i>I'm sure he's already spilled</i>

290
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,669
<i>everything he knows to Cadmus.</i>

291
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:20,129
Don't you understand? We can't trust him.

292
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,092
J'onn, we can't trust anyone now.
