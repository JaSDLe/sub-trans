1
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,056
But how come when I make the scones

2
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,391
they don't got that good flavor like yours, Tony?

3
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,020
Do I have to tell you again how you gotta add

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,438
the orange zest, Cecil?

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,274
You gonna make me give you the recipe again, huh?

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,194
You're killin' me here, Cecil. Killin' me.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,241
- I heard something. - Shut up, Cecil.

8
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,535
I'm trying to listen.

9
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,162
Why you gotta be so mean all the time, Tony?

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,874
- I'm always nice to you. - You're killin' me, Cecil.

11
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:39,181
Steven Mandragora, been a while.

12
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,144
I've changed some since we met last but you haven't changed.

13
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,232
<i>All these years you've been building your empire</i>

14
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,773
<i>with thievery and murder.</i>

15
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,650
But it ends tonight.

16
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,913
- No. - <i>Huntress!</i>

17
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,999
J'onn, I...

18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,882
You were warned. You were told to stay away from Mandragora.

19
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,803
You have violated my direct orders. You've crossed the line.

20
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>You've been watching me?</i>

21
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:33,129
Given what occurred tonight, I'd say

22
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:35,089
it was a wise precaution.

23
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:37,717
You know what Mandragora did and I almost had him.

24
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:41,387
He should have been there, but someone tipped him.

25
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,557
- You did it. - I had Mandragora moved, yes.

26
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:47,643
For his own protection, and yours.

27
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,271
Alright, J'onn, so I get some Justice League demerits.

28
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,189
Fine, just spare me the lecture.

29
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,150
I can find him without your help.

30
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:58,070
You misunderstand. Tonight was a test and you failed.

31
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,741
Pack your things, Huntress. You're out.

32
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,243
You'll need to turn in your identification card...

33
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,162
immediately.

34
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,082
Fine.

35
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,961
I hope you choke on it.

36
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,267
<i>Oh, Cadmus, Cadmus, wherefore art thou, Cadmus?</i>

37
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:34,440
I know there's a connection. Don't think I won't find it.

38
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,237
Maybe you're not looking in the right direction.

39
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,574
You're the League's data guy, the conspiracy buff, right?

40
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,659
Wildcat says you're a nut job.

41
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,078
Funny, he says the same thing about you.

42
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,789
He's right.

43
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,625
Okay, bored now. Goodbye.

44
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,003
You must be the ugliest guy of all time, Question.

45
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,423
- Hiding your face like that. - Go away.

46
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,134
<i>- Don't touch that!</i> - Wow.

47
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,637
I had no idea that the girl scouts were responsible

48
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,555
for the crop circle phenomenon.

49
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,684
Few people do. Few even think to ask the question.

50
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,354
Well, I have a question for you then.

51
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,773
Do you know what apophenia is?

52
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,525
Apophenia, noun.

53
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,611
The tendency to see connections where none exist.

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,780
Did you come here just to make fun of my work?

55
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,950
No, Q. I came to help you.

56
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:29,245
And let's just keep the rest of the League out of it, shall we?

57
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:33,040
Here's the deal, I tell you what I know about Cadmus

58
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,501
immediately after you help me find out what rock

59
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,753
Steven Mandragora's hiding under.

60
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,172
Hmm, interesting.

61
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,843
Slurp slurp slurp

62
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,185
I believe that individual passed beyond the veil

63
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,313
at the hands of one Tommy Monahan who himself later

64
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,067
mistakenly fell onto a train track, I am told.

65
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,570
Now, why is it that most of your criminal acquaintances

66
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,697
seem to be deceased?

67
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,824
Perhaps my friends are simply prone

68
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,660
to misfortune, Agent Faraday.

69
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,829
My job is to prep you to testify

70
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,789
before the grand jury, Mr. Mandragora.

71
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,934
You're gonna have to come up with a lot more than some mook

72
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,751
who may or may not be around anymore

73
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,004
if you want immunity from prosecution.

74
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,881
I am doing my best.

75
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,008
You can't blame me for being nervous.

76
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,885
I have enemies everywhere.

77
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,430
Even Justice League enemies.

78
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:32,683
Besides, I am ravaged by hunger.

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,979
Feed me and I shall squeal on all manner of former associates.

80
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,940
Speaking of squealing, Black Canary

81
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,776
I notice you can't take your eyes off of me.

82
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,905
One can hardly blame you.

83
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,632
Perhaps after Agent Faraday helps absolve me

84
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,742
of my alleged crimes

85
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,746
I could put you in a cage and have you sing for me.

86
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,289
Listen, you giant tub of...

87
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,225
Green Arrow, may I remind you that you're here

88
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,043
strictly in a security capacity?

89
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,089
Yes, why don't you go and fetch me another four platters

90
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,051
of oysters like a good, little leprechaun?

91
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,511
I'm sure your girlfriend and I will have much

92
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,972
to discuss while you're gone.

93
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,099
Slurp slurp

94
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,771
I like my oysters sweet by the way, sweet and juicy.

95
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,273
Let him talk, Arrow, with all the enemies he's made

96
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,984
he never knows if he's eating his last meal.

97
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,986
Ha ha ha!

98
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,990
Alright, Q. You said you'd help me.

99
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,326
Where are they keeping Mandragora?

100
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,869
Well?

101
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,747
Oh, you did not just hang up on me.

102
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,047
Figured I'd cut out the middleman.

103
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:56,475
Oh, baby doll, and just for the record

104
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,103
I usually prefer my dates to have a face.

105
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,527
Five minutes, that's all I need. Just give me five minutes.

106
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,696
I'll teach this pompous jerk some manners.

107
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,074
Listen, Justice League or not, you will sit down and behave.

108
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,159
- You heard what he said. <i>- Oh, dear.</i>

109
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,246
Did I offend you somehow, little man?

110
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:20,541
My most sincere apologies.

111
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:24,586
Faraday's right, Arrow. Relax.

112
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,356
Nothing this guy can say is gonna affect me

113
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,423
one way or the other.

114
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,049
Is that right?

115
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,885
Well, then, perhaps you won't mind explaining how a lovely

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,639
young lady like you ends up with a nobody like him.

117
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,184
Were all the real men in the Justice League already taken?

118
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,387
I hope you're proud of yourself.

119
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,610
Now we have to do guard duty from outside.

120
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,572
Hope I'm proud of myself? You're the one that punched him.

121
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,533
Yeah, but, ow! It was like punching a brick wall.

122
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,326
There's no fat on that man.

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,705
Will you let me look?

124
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,922
I think you'll live to punch suspects

125
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,424
another day, pretty bird.

126
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,509
Let's find some higher ground.

127
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,933
This is ridiculous, I can't believe

128
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,311
we're going to all this trouble to protect a killer.

129
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,397
That's how it goes, Dinah, they let a bad guy go free

130
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,734
he rats out dozens of others. It's not perfect.

131
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,861
No, no, it isn't.

132
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,073
Makes you wonder how his victims would feel if they knew.

133
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:36,825
Hey, you gonna get all serious on me?

134
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:39,453
You bet.

135
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,546
- More cops. - So? The more, the merrier.

136
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,256
Someone else too.

137
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,554
Who are these guys? I haven't seen them here before.

138
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,932
Keep your big shirt on, Mr. Mandragora.

139
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,035
- They're checking 'em out. - You check them out.

140
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,311
That's your job, do it.

141
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,192
Okay, guys. Let's see some ID.

142
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,444
Nice night for a distraction, ain't it?

143
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,540
<i>You're not going in that house, Huntress.</i>

144
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,166
That I promise.

145
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,085
I'm here on League business, Canary.

146
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,171
That's not what J'onn said. We just called him.

147
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,133
- Okay, that didn't work. - Maybe this will.

148
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,611
Why are you doing this, Question?

149
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,780
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

150
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,671
And here I heard you were some kind of brilliant fighter.

151
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,970
You heard right.

152
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,438
<i>I strongly advise you to stay down.</i>

153
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:32,524
These impact arrows are non-lethal, but they hurt...

154
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,443
a lot.

155
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:37,237
He's gone. Mandragora is gone.

156
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,790
Do you have any idea what you've done?

157
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,542
Yes, I hunted a murderer.

158
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,711
A murderer the League's protecting.

159
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,201
We don't have time for this, we've got to ask the question

160
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,299
what he just picked up and put in his pocket.

161
00:11:57,507 --> 00:12:00,594
- Me? - Don't make me ask again.

162
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:04,723
Oh, you mean this.

163
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,393
It's a storage key for a place down by the train station.

164
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,937
Alright, you two stay here.

165
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,564
Don't make me sic Black Canary on you.

166
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,858
You've only seen her nice side so far.

167
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,576
Ow! What was that for?

168
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,370
All that crazy mystery man mojo

169
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,373
and you couldn't even pick up a clue without being seen?

170
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:33,377
The key wasn't the clue. The key was mine.

171
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,380
<i>Now this list of container ship arrivals I palmed</i>

172
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,842
while they were yelling at you, that's the clue.

173
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,679
I don't get it. Why aren't we on our way to the train station?

174
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,055
Shh!

175
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,519
Because I know when I'm being conned.

176
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,647
You're cute when you're an insufferable smarty-pants.

177
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,658
You're even smarter than they say.

178
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,536
Smart enough to realize you don't know jack about Cadmus.

179
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:10,622
- I needed your help. - Talk to me about Mandragora.

180
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,375
What did he do to you?

181
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,920
- You wouldn't understand. - Wouldn't understand what?

182
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,673
That he worked for your father, Franco Bertinelli

183
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:22,384
or that your father was himself a powerful crime boss?

184
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:25,929
<i>You were just a child.</i>

185
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,949
<i>You certainly didn't understand what your father</i>

186
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,725
<i>did for a living.</i>

187
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:33,937
<i>You just knew that when he talked, people listened.</i>

188
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,023
<i>That he always had his guys around him</i>

189
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,150
<i>to do whatever he said</i>

190
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:42,237
<i>and that the most frightening one was Mandragora.</i>

191
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,450
<i>Looking into his eyes was like looking into an empty pit.</i>

192
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,577
<i>One terrible night, Mandragora decided</i>

193
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,787
<i>he no longer wished to take orders.</i>

194
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,419
Get behind me, Helena. It will be alright.

195
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:04,051
<i>Your father hoped to protect you by hiding you in a closet.</i>

196
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,056
<i>He's coming.</i>

197
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,316
<i>But you saw it all, Helena.</i>

198
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,693
<i>Steven Mandragora killed your parents</i>

199
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,154
<i>while you watched helplessly.</i>

200
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
Isn't that what happened?

201
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,533
If you knew all that, then you probably know

202
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,870
what I'm gonna do to Mandragora when I catch him.

203
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,374
- So why help me? - That is the question.

204
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,420
Somebody's following us.

205
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:45,217
- Lose them. - Like airline luggage.

206
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,933
You're not supposed to drive when you're angry.

207
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,268
They're heading towards the waterfront. Hang on.

208
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,604
It's so funny you think you have to tell me that.

209
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:04,069
<i>Stop the car, Question. Pull over.</i>

210
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:05,779
Stop following us, Canary.

211
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:08,115
- Is that her? Give me that. <i>- Hey!</i>

212
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,742
You want a piece of me, Blondie? Bring it.

213
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,135
This is so unnecessary.

214
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,307
- Are we dead yet? - No.

215
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,351
Are we dead yet?

216
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,271
Look, if we die, I promise I'll let you know.

217
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,154
- Train. - I see it.

218
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:48,697
- Train! - I see it!

219
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:57,664
Oops!

220
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,382
J'onn, get us out of here now.

221
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:27,486
Ugh! I can't believe you. I rebuilt that bike by hand.

222
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:31,072
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry I saved our lives.

223
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,994
And J'onn thinks Huntress is the unstable one.

224
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,379
Look, there are 100 ships leaving here a day.

225
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,468
If Mandragora's trying to get out of the country

226
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,348
how are we supposed to know which one he's on?

227
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,385
What if he isn't hopping a freighter?

228
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,138
What if he's playing a more subtle game?

229
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,308
No more questions, okay? What are you saying?

230
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,810
What if he's here to meet a freighter?

231
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,438
As it happens, there's one coming in from his home country

232
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,941
this very evening.

233
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,817
Come on.

234
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,574
That's him. He's mine.

235
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:58,243
You take the two guards. Ready?

236
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,337
I'm really starting to dislike that woman.

237
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,553
Hey!

238
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:19,347
I got your plate of oysters right here, jumbo.

239
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,393
Warned you.

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,835
<i>Didn't anyone ever tell you, Mandragora...</i>

241
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,133
no one messes with the Justice League?

242
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,165
Ha ha ha!

243
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,879
Mandragora!

244
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,964
I've got special arrows too.

245
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,759
The pointy kind that will go right through you.

246
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,261
Put her down now!

247
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,138
Very well then.

248
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,101
Back to federal custody, I suppose.

249
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,561
- Not this time. <i>- Papa!</i>

250
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,322
Edgar!

251
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:08,039
On my last trip to the old country

252
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,334
a rival criminal organization kidnapped my son.

253
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,546
It took me all this time to arrange his rescue.

254
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,923
<i>Rest assured that his captors were taught</i>

255
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,300
<i>the error of their ways.</i>

256
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,887
Rest assured, I'm about to teach you the same lesson.

257
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,853
All I wanted was for my son and I to disappear together.

258
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,903
Get behind me, Edgar. It will be alright.

259
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,241
<i>Huntress!</i>

260
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,495
Is this really what you want?

261
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,470
No.

262
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,740
That's not what I want at all.

263
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,626
<i>Mandragora never had any intention</i>

264
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,629
<i>of cooperating with the prosecutors.</i>

265
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,256
<i>He was just stalling until his son arrived.</i>

266
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,345
<i>Their new identities were already in place.</i>

267
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,347
<i>Not to mention a Cayman Island account</i>

268
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:51,142
full of ill-gotten gains to finance their new lives.

269
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,687
You knew all along that kid was gonna be on that freighter.

270
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,189
I do my homework.

271
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:58,650
Then why go to all the trouble to help?

272
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,110
Why risk your life for me?

273
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,322
Because I... like you.

274
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,127
- Where are we going? - Don't ask so many questions.

275
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,421
I'm sorry, but, ew!
