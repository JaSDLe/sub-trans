1
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:04,689
I've been wondering when you were going to show up.

2
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,607
Terry McGinnis.

3
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,153
<i>Or do you prefer being called... Batman?</i>

4
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,522
How could you do it to me, Bruce?

5
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,566
The only thing that matters is the mission.

6
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,026
You know that.

7
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,527
What about people, Bruce?

8
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,238
Dick, Barbara, Tim, Selena?

9
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,716
They all loved you, but eventually

10
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,158
every single one of them left you.

11
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,868
Ever wonder why?

12
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,328
Not for an instant.

13
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,205
They quit because when it came down to it

14
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,166
they didn't have the heart for the mission.

15
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,293
Are you about to quit, too?

16
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,003
It doesn't really surprise me.

17
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,546
It doesn't?

18
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,507
Of course not.

19
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,551
I've been expecting this day for years.

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,971
Why don't you put that thing away, take off your coat

21
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,598
and sit a spell?

22
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
I've got some questions I need you to answer.

23
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,562
Of course you do, boy.

24
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,106
Why else go to all the trouble

25
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,607
of breaking into the lair

26
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,443
of the great and powerful Amanda Waller?

27
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,779
You want some green tea? I do.

28
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,990
Full of antioxidants this stuff.

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,118
It's supposed to make you live longer.

30
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,080
I don't want tea. I want answers.

31
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,165
Then you're going to have to humor me.

32
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,292
It's been many a year since I had

33
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,129
a handsome gentlemen caller.

34
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:36,590
Why is it that super heroes are always

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,218
so good-looking?

36
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,554
- Drink up. - I don't want any tea!

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,726
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:49,186
Sorry isn't good enough.

39
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,188
What's this all about?

40
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,442
Your safety. You know how much I care about you.

41
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,361
Sure. Why else keep dating for 15 years?

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,822
You know why I can't marry you. If the...

43
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,824
"if the bad guys ever found out I was Batman

44
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,784
they'd try to get to me by hurting you."

45
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,369
Blah blah blah.

46
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,830
- It's nothing to joke about. - You're right.

47
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,374
There could be super villains hiding in the tall grass.

48
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,126
I'm poison, Dana.

49
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,711
Cursed.

50
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,504
You're silly, McGinnis.

51
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,132
It's not silly for me to want to keep you safe.

52
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,802
Every moment we're together you're risking your life.

53
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,804
I've told you a 100 times.

54
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,265
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

55
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,477
I'm taking the choice out of your hands.

56
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:30,728
What are you saying?

57
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,646
I'm saying we're done.

58
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,197
- I'm sorry. - Oh, that's okay.

59
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:44,074
I've only had that cup for 70 years.

60
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,118
My mother passed it on to me.

61
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,037
Guess that's what all this is about.

62
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,455
Legacies.

63
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:51,999
Doubt you can find this pattern anymore.

64
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,336
It's real China, not that synthetic stuff.

65
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:58,172
How can anyone be their own man living someone else's dream?

66
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,674
It's been years since I've had enough friends to use

67
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,009
the whole set anyway.

68
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,136
How can I escape the curse of Batman?

69
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,806
Even so, one missing piece

70
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,140
and the set's ruined.

71
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,892
Ruined, I tell you.

72
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,979
I would offer my condolences...

73
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,358
but that would be insincere.

74
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,109
That's it. Caper's blown.

75
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,611
Get out of...

76
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,005
Ah, like water. Very good.

77
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:21,755
Good of you to drop in considering that three-quarters

78
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,216
of the iniquity collective are from your Rogue's gallery.

79
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,968
Well, it's the last time.

80
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,656
I'm not working with you guys anymore.

81
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,201
- What? - What are you talking about?

82
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:32,224
You can't quit. The Justice League needs Batman.

83
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,768
Forget it. Batman is dead.

84
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,699
When did you figure it all out?

85
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,452
I guess I've always known, but a few months ago

86
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,847
when Bruce's kidney's failed and they needed a tissue donor

87
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,290
to clone him new ones, turned out I was a perfect

88
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,751
histo-compatibility match with him.

89
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,170
Perfect. You know the odds?

90
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:03,172
111 -1.

91
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,007
Yeah.

92
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,926
So, you ran a DNA test.

93
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,011
Once I worked up the nerve.

94
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,379
I was 16 years old when you started training me, Bruce.

95
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:13,057
A punk kid with a smart mouth

96
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:14,975
and potential I didn't even suspect.

97
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,384
I may have pretended otherwise

98
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,812
but I looked up to you, worshipped you.

99
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,732
What you wanted from me, I couldn't give to anyone.

100
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,859
Tell me something I don't know.

101
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,197
My dad wasn't a superhero.

102
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:30,950
He didn't save the world from the near apocalypse of '09.

103
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,743
He never went toe-to-toe with Mr. Freeze

104
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,370
but he was a good man just the same.

105
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,163
Even after he and mom got divorced

106
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,290
he always tried to do the right thing.

107
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,167
My brother and I were always provided for.

108
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,253
When mom couldn't quite make the bills, he always helped out.

109
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,339
He tried to teach me right from wrong

110
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,841
would have, too, if I'd ever listened to him.

111
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,361
And he never laid a hand on me although

112
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,011
Lord knows I was asking for it.

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,807
- What's your point? - What's my point?

114
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,910
My point is I never once doubted that he loved me

115
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,687
with all his heart. My point is all those warm feelings

116
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,773
I had for my dad, turns out they were just another lie.

117
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,359
Another in the long list of things you've stolen from me!

118
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,361
My point is I just found out

119
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,780
that Warren McGinnis isn't my father!

120
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,615
You are!

121
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,536
What do you want from me?

122
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,329
I want to know the whole truth.

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,039
Sounds like you already do.

124
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,688
Guess I didn't want to believe you were so incredibly arrogant

125
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,712
that you thought the world couldn't go on without you.

126
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,588
Or someone like me.

127
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,425
It's not arrogance. It's fact.

128
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,884
You set the whole thing up.

129
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,220
How? You were already a teenager

130
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,589
when I first met your mother.

131
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,890
I don't know. Maybe you dug up some of that

132
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,767
old Cadmus nanotech.

133
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,912
Used it to have my genes rewritten to match yours.

134
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,730
That technology's been illegal

135
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,815
for over 40 years.

136
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,192
Didn't stop the Joker from using it on Tim Drake.

137
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,822
Alright, low blow.

138
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,199
Because you'd never lie to me, right?

139
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,453
Fine. Believe what you want.

140
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,164
But you know as well as I do, accident or not

141
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,083
it's a good thing that you're almost a clone of me.

142
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,962
The world does need a Batman and it always will.

143
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,636
The mantle of Batman is an honor, Terry.

144
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,350
You know what, old man?

145
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,853
All those years, turns out everybody was right.

146
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,815
You are insane. Being Batman is no honor.

147
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,317
It's a curse.

148
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,541
Look at all this.

149
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,418
A pill for blood pressure.

150
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,587
A pill for my diabetes.

151
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,965
A pill to replace my pituitary function.

152
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,093
I don't even know what this one's for.

153
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,303
Oh, yeah, Alzheimer's.

154
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,138
Don't pretend you're some dowdy old lady

155
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,598
who can't remember anything.

156
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,326
I've got questions, and you're the only one

157
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,392
left with the answers.

158
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,228
Besides Bruce, you mean.

159
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,355
Bruce can't be trusted.

160
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,690
I should have realized what he was capable of.

161
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,168
Once he settles on a course of action

162
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,652
he won't stop at anything.

163
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,903
If you think that

164
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,738
you don't know him at all.

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,159
Let me tell you a little story.

166
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,163
<i>It was a long time ago, when Batman was young and so was I.</i>

167
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,209
<i>The Justice League found themselves cleaning up</i>

168
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,212
<i>one of my old messes.</i>

169
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,297
<i>The second group of villains to call themselves</i>

170
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>the Royal Flush gang or the third.</i>

171
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:36,385
<i>Who can keep it all straight?</i>

172
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,467
<i>Eventually the League took them down.</i>

173
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,178
<i>Most of them anyway.</i>

174
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,893
<i>That's where I came in.</i>

175
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,981
Waller, should have recognized your hand in this.

176
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,108
No time for the usual pleasantries.

177
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,651
Before you go after Ace

178
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,737
you need to know what you're getting into.

179
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,281
I've met her before. She has the power to give anyone

180
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,533
she's in contact with hallucinations

181
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,868
as you can see.

182
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,286
<i>It's worse than you think.</i>

183
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:45,996
Ace's powers have evolved.

184
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,290
She doesn't create hallucinations anymore.

185
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,834
She telekinetically warps reality.

186
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,462
Please. Are you trying to tell me all this is real?

187
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,922
Real, growing, and permanent

188
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,007
if we don't put a stop to it all.

189
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,551
Cadmus psytechs predict that Ace is days

190
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,095
maybe only hours, from a massive aneurysm.

191
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,181
- Problem solved. - Not that simple.

192
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,558
When she goes, the psychic backlash

193
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,852
could kill everyone in range of her powers.

194
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,271
That's a distance measured in miles.

195
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:17,527
<i>Take her down before she takes everyone with her.</i>

196
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,989
I'll do it, Shayera.

197
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,283
I'm the only one of us Ace knows.

198
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,078
She might let me get close enough to use it.

199
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,872
Do you understand what you're agreeing to?

200
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,000
The only way to stop Ace for certain is to kill her.

201
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,484
Hey! Huh!

202
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,300
Batman.

203
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,093
Ace.

204
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,679
Did you like playing with my new Royal Flush gang?

205
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,306
Can't say that I did.

206
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:30,017
Yeah. They aren't any fun at all.

207
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,560
I gave them their powers

208
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,520
and they still hardly ever play with me.

209
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,023
Can't imagine why.

210
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,692
When I was little, Cadmus used to make me play all kinds

211
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,528
of games, but they weren't any fun either.

212
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,196
They'd strap me into their machines

213
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,198
and poke wires into my brain.

214
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,951
"Ace, can you move this object with your mind?"

215
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,623
<i>Yeah, I can move it.</i>

216
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,917
They weren't really games you know.

217
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,419
They were training me.

218
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:58,920
Turning me into a weapon

219
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,214
for justice, they said.

220
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,966
They got their weapon.

221
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,011
I got cheated out of my childhood.

222
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,013
I know what that's like.

223
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,598
You do, don't you?

224
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,353
You don't have to answer. I've read your mind.

225
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,855
That's how I knew you weren't going to use Mrs. Waller's

226
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,358
weapon on me.

227
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,194
No, I wasn't.

228
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:23,820
You were going to try and talk me

229
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,199
into fixing what I've changed.

230
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:28,950
Before I die.

231
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,619
Yes.

232
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:33,246
I'm dying very soon.

233
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,833
Yes. I'm sorry.

234
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,297
Could you stay with me?

235
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,633
I'm scared.

236
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>He sat with her until her time came.</i>

237
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,144
That's the Bruce Wayne I came to know over the years.

238
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,104
You think he showed mercy?

239
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,148
Maybe. But more likely he'd somehow

240
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,401
already deduced that Ace wasn't really gonna hurt anyone.

241
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,237
He always was two steps ahead of everybody.

242
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,614
That's right. Even when it looks like

243
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,033
it's your call, it isn't. Think about it.

244
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,743
Bruce wanted a successor.

245
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:56,913
Another Batman. He planned it all from the beginning.

246
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,457
I never had a chance.

247
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:02,794
Honey, Bruce didn't overwrite your DNA with his.

248
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,546
I did.

249
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,176
How? Why?

250
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:12,012
Because the world needs a Batman.

251
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,681
Not that I always thought so, mind you.

252
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
Before you were born

253
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,477
Bruce and I were enemies.

254
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,061
His Justice League was easily

255
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,439
the most powerful force on Earth.

256
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:23,982
As you know, I was in charge

257
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,109
of project Cadmus.

258
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,402
Over the years

259
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,198
I came to respect Batman, even trust him.

260
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,700
Guess the law of averages means somebody would have to.

261
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,869
Did you know I was the government liaison

262
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,746
with the Justice League for a while?

263
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,582
I met some extraordinary people in that job.

264
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,084
But none of them were the equal of Batman.

265
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,003
Right. Who could be?

266
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,839
Not my point. I saw him save the day dozens of times

267
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,968
with nothing but his wits, body, and will.

268
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,096
But I saw something else as the years passed.

269
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,099
He was getting older, slower.

270
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,852
Soon he'd have to retire, or more likely, someone would

271
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,604
finally manage to kill him.

272
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:04,356
The thought of a world without Batman

273
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,900
was unacceptable.

274
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,402
So I decided to make a new one.

275
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,616
<i>I used my old Cadmus connections</i>

276
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:18,537
<i>to gather technology necessary for project Batman beyond.</i>

277
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,460
<i>Bruce's DNA was easy enough to obtain.</i>

278
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,629
<i>He left it all over town.</i>

279
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,092
Not remotely what I meant.

280
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,053
<i>Then I found a young Neo-Gotham couple</i>

281
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,014
<i>with psychological profiles nearly identical</i>

282
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,141
<i>to those of Bruce's parents.</i>

283
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>Your father thought he was getting a flu shot.</i>

284
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:48,483
<i>Actually, it was a nanotech solution</i>

285
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,069
<i>programmed to rewrite his reproductive material</i>

286
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,030
<i>into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's.</i>

287
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,782
<i>A little over a year later</i>

288
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,993
<i>your mother gave birth to you.</i>

289
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:01,371
<i>A child sharing half her genetic material</i>

290
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,123
<i>and half Bruce's.</i>

291
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,167
But when you're making a Batman

292
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,795
genetics is only part of the story.

293
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,922
The rest is tragedy.

294
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,051
<i>Stop me if you've heard it before.</i>

295
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,804
<i>You're 8 years old. Your parents have just taken you</i>

296
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,349
<i>to a rousing adventure film.</i>

297
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,476
<i>A grand time is had by all.</i>

298
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,106
<i>But unknown to you</i>

299
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,817
<i>a mysterious figure hides in the shadows.</i>

300
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,028
<i>My plan was simple.</i>

301
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:34,613
<i>The killer would leap out at you</i>

302
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:37,157
<i>and kill your family.</i>

303
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:40,035
<i>The trauma would put you on the path to becoming Batman.</i>

304
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:45,999
<i>One problem. My assassin wouldn't pull the trigger.</i>

305
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,169
<i>I argued with her</i>

306
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,588
<i>but deep down, I knew she was right.</i>

307
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:54,341
<i>People say Batman's obsessive</i>

308
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,594
<i>that he'd do anything to achieve his goals</i>

309
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,721
<i>but he'd never resort to murder.</i>

310
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,976
<i>So if I was to honor all he stood for...</i>

311
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,563
Neither could I.

312
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,108
And yet my dad wound up murdered anyway.

313
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,153
Don't you get it? No matter what you did or didn't do

314
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,989
I was gonna end up being Bruce's carbon copy.

315
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,699
It was fate.

316
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,748
You know, the Lord's been a great comfort to me

317
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,536
all these years.

318
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,622
Try not to look so surprised.

319
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,917
Yeah, I have got a lot to answer for when I meet him

320
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,128
but I'd like to believe that for all the harm I've caused

321
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,881
<i>I've also done some good.</i>

322
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,384
Maybe the angels need a sharp sword, too.

323
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,970
Like the good book says, "He moves in mysterious ways."

324
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,141
His plan is a mystery, but here's what isn't.

325
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,560
He gave us free will.

326
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,522
We choose our own fate.

327
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,274
For good or ill.

328
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,235
I've known Bruce Wayne

329
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,237
for over 50 years, and I've been keeping

330
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,739
an eye on you your whole life.

331
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,700
You're not Bruce's clone.

332
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,702
You're his son.

333
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,829
There are similarities, mind you

334
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,957
but more than a few differences, too.

335
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:13,044
You don't quite have his magnificent brain, for instance.

336
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,088
You do have his heart, though.

337
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,048
And for all that fierce exterior

338
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,509
I've never met anyone who cared as deeply

339
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,845
about his fellow man as Bruce Wayne

340
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,430
except maybe you.

341
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,853
You want to have a little better life than the old man's?

342
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:33,064
Take care of the people who love you.

343
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,942
Or don't. It's your choice.

344
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,333
<i>- Hello?</i> - Hi.

345
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,961
Terry? What time is it?

346
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,713
<i>- It's just after 3.</i> - Oh, baby.

347
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,215
I have to be up at 5. What's wrong?

348
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,968
I just wanted to know if we were still on for this weekend?

349
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,220
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

350
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,431
- <i>Something come up again?</i> - No.

351
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,057
I just want to ask you something.

352
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,309
<i>So ask.</i>

353
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:11,686
No, not until I see you.

354
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,397
<i>- Okay.</i> - So, Friday night?

355
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,066
- <i>Fine.</i> - Goodnight.

356
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,194
- Love you. <i>- Love you, too.</i>

357
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,865
You're in my chair.

358
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,992
Yeah, guess I am.

359
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,869
Where the devil have you been?

360
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,662
I had some stuff to take care of.

361
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,041
Enigma's overrated, especially at 3 a.m.

362
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,585
You could have called. I made you some soup.

363
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,004
- But it's cold. - Sorry.

364
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,923
Didn't mean to worry you.

365
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,383
I was worried about Gotham.

366
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,220
If Batman's not around...

367
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:46,721
I've got it covered.

368
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,014
Always.

369
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,020
Kent called. Nothing apocalyptic.

370
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,648
He just wants your opinion on a case he's working.

371
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,608
Said you could meet him at the Metro Tower.

372
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,568
Right. Better suit up.

373
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,320
You should eat something first.

374
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,280
- Keep up your strength. - When I get back.

375
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,659
You're a stubborn piece of work, you know that?

376
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,452
Just like my old man.

377
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,720
Did you see that?
