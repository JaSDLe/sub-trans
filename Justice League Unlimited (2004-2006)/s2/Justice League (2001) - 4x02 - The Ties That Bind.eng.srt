1
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:14,055
What are you? The world's greatest escape artist?

2
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:15,556
Or the world's greatest idiot?

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,016
For cryin' out loud, Scott

4
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,935
not even you can get out of this trap.

5
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:20,978
That's what I like about you, Oberon.

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,688
Your incurable optimism.

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,650
Stop distracting him and get the canister.

8
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,486
I hate to admit this, but Oberon has a point.

9
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:29,779
Don't worry, darling.

10
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,490
They don't call me Mr. Miracle for nothing.

11
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:33,950
First rule of show business

12
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:35,701
never believe your own publicity.

13
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:46,379
Craziest stunt you ever pulled.

14
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:48,798
That's why we're rehearsing it.

15
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,716
Kid's got an answer for everything.

16
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,613
Let's hope the train's running late today.

17
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,569
Leave it to Scott Free to find the newest wrinkles.

18
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:11,237
He's sure given me a few.

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,126
Scott? Scott!

20
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,090
"O ye of little faith."

21
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,636
Scott, I thought you were dead.

22
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,389
You insufferable showboat.

23
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,182
I thought you were dead.

24
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,351
When are you and Oberon gonna learn that...

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,395
Hey, where is Oberon?

26
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,400
Don't worry, dumpling,.

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,319
He's safe and sound

28
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:53,988
in Granny's loving care.

29
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:58,409
Of course, if you ever want to see the old runt alive again

30
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,996
you'll do exactly as Granny says.

31
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,147
Granny Goodness.

32
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,233
I'll kill you, you demented old gargoyle!

33
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,402
Barda, I'm not gonna let your temper

34
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,612
cost us Oberon's life.

35
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,866
I knew you wouldn't let her hurt your old granny, Scott.

36
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,451
What do you want?

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,163
Life on Apokolips has become very difficult

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,833
since great Darkseid vanished.

39
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,503
Dear Granny has tried her best to bring order to our world.

40
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,630
You mean, you've been trying to take over.

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,385
But there are others who seek to thwart Granny's good intentions.

42
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,178
Virman Vundabar.

43
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,848
That awful, awful man.

44
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,184
You know that he's actually imprisoned Darkseid's son

45
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,729
poor dimwitted Kalibak

46
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:53,232
in hopes of legitimizing his claim to the throne?

47
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,401
Why, he's probably

48
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,362
brainwashing the poor creature right now.

49
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,240
Bending him to his will.

50
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,409
Like you're not planning the same thing.

51
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,995
What do you want?

52
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:08,164
Oh, it's nothing, really.

53
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,041
Granny just needs you to break into the place

54
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,585
where Kalibak is being held

55
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,337
and then bring him to Granny's orphanage

56
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,090
where he can get... proper care.

57
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,594
If we do that, we'll be handing you control of Apokolips.

58
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,053
Exactly.

59
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,681
But if you find that prospect distasteful

60
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,725
wait till you see what Oberon looks like

61
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,935
when I send him back to you.

62
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,812
Piece by piece.

63
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,856
Where is Kalibak?

64
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:36,400
On Apokolips, of course.

65
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,651
In the X-Pit.

66
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,238
Why, you're not afraid

67
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,866
of the Pit, are you, Scott?

68
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,589
No, I'm not afraid.

69
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,508
<i>Can it hurt them to show me just a little respect?</i>

70
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,972
Tell me about it. I've been at this longer than you have.

71
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,974
They still treat me like comic relief.

72
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,727
Better than being treated like a teenage sidekick.

73
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,938
I mean, I was one of the original seven.

74
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,397
Tell me the truth, Ralph.

75
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,649
Do I seem immature to you?

76
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,651
Not in the least.

77
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,569
Ah! I bopped your block off!

78
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,947
That-that's not fair. The green guy's arms are longer.

79
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,155
Are not.

80
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,741
Hey, isn't that Mr. Miracle

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,576
and what's her name, Big Bertha?

82
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,578
I didn't even know they were in the League.

83
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,587
But there's so many of us now, it's hard to...

84
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,250
No, they're not in the League. I'm sure of it.

85
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,753
And this Granny Goodness picked you because...

86
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,798
I'm the only one who ever escaped the X-Pit.

87
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,486
- Yeah, but what's... - Please, Flash.

88
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,343
And if you refuse her request?

89
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,388
- Oberon dies. - Down, dear.

90
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,224
We've only got 24 hours, and we need help.

91
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,432
Well, I'd be happy to...

92
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,769
Superfast, invulnerable help.

93
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,063
Superman's on a mission in deep space.

94
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,272
But even if he weren't

95
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:58,594
it makes no sense for the League

96
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,691
to help another dictator

97
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,735
come to power on Apokolips.

98
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,029
A dictator who could eventually threaten Earth

99
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,781
just as Darkseid did.

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,658
Better to let them fight among themselves

101
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,618
than attack the rest of the universe.

102
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,246
Why, you green-skinned, beetle-browed

103
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:13,454
arrogant, son of a...

104
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,957
What Barda means is

105
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,625
what about Oberon?

106
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,502
He's been like a second father to me.

107
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,673
I'm truly sorry.

108
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,974
I thought we were all about helping people.

109
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,934
And would you have us help three people

110
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,728
at the expense of billions more?

111
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:36,936
Well, no, but...

112
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,021
You need to look at

113
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,399
the big picture, Wally.

114
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,943
Well, excuse me for opening my big, dumb mouth.

115
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,073
We don't need these cowards.

116
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,575
We can do it on our own.

117
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,994
Great news, Bertha, you don't have to.

118
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,329
Barda.

119
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,205
Isn't that what I said?

120
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,541
And we don't require your assistance.

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,627
We appreciate the offer, Flash, but...

122
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,922
Unless you've got an S on your chest, you're useless.

123
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,883
Hey, I may not be as strong as Superman

124
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,092
but I'm just as fast.

125
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,928
- Maybe faster. - Uh!

126
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,974
Friends?

127
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,478
Maybe we can use you.

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>Kalibak, Kalibak, Kalibak.</i>

129
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:36,121
I have used every vile punishment

130
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,998
every known torture

131
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,501
and still you refuse to join

132
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,629
Virman Vundabar's noble cause.

133
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:46,590
You're about as noble as my armpit.

134
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,844
Very well. You've forced me to my last resort.

135
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,141
Cake!

136
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,906
Oh, did I say that was my last resort?

137
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,535
My mistake. I have one more.

138
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,721
Enjoying Granny's hospitality?

139
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,849
Oh, blow it out your shorts, you goose-stepping harpy.

140
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:41,061
I would speak to Granny with just a tad more respect.

141
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,066
Because soon I will be ruler of all Apokolips.

142
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,943
You always been this deluded

143
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,612
or is it just since senility set in?

144
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,365
Oh, you wound Granny.

145
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,244
But not as deeply as Granny is going to wound you.

146
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,539
Zing zing zing

147
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,042
Zing zing zing

148
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,263
Should've brought my sunscreen.

149
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,060
Over there.

150
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,978
That's where the X-Pit is housed

151
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,314
and Kalibak with it.

152
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,899
Not that I mind the exercise

153
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,187
but couldn't your boob tube

154
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,735
have transported us any closer?

155
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,196
It's boom tube.

156
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,124
Don't you think we would have come in closer

157
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,240
if we could have?

158
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,242
Vundabar's technology disrupts

159
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,244
the time/space field of the tubes.

160
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,288
Otherwise, we would have just boomed Kalibak

161
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,873
out of the pit, right?

162
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,042
Oh. Right.

163
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,444
Why do I get the feeling those puppies

164
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,552
haven't had their shots?

165
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,054
So, let's give 'em a few.

166
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,772
Not bad.

167
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,621
She always this free with the compliments?

168
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,732
Come on.

169
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,323
So, do we just knock, or...

170
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,836
It's... it's all different.

171
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,762
Why, Scott, why?

172
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,015
All of the others obey Granny

173
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,641
love Granny.

174
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,228
But you, you just keep trying to escape.

175
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,065
And I'll... never stop.

176
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,489
- Scott? - Change of plans.

177
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,033
You two stay put out here.

178
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,492
I'll go in and get Kalibak.

179
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,077
No way. I'm coming too.

180
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,079
- We both are. - Listen to me.

181
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,415
They've changed the whole architecture of this place

182
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,042
since the last time I was here.

183
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,877
All my plans are out the window.

184
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:53,378
Who needs plans?

185
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,547
I've always been a spontaneous kind of guy.

186
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,382
Neither of you signed on for this.

187
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,636
Actually, I did... the day I married you.

188
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:02,804
Well, I'm not that committed

189
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,681
but I'm with you.

190
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,975
Alright, then, into the Pit.

191
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,234
Ah, this should be a magnificent show

192
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,570
even if I already know the ending. Ha ha ha.

193
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,336
So, you two grew up around here?

194
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,755
This cesspool of a world was all I knew.

195
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,550
I was one of Granny's blind and brainwashed puppets

196
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,928
until Scott cut my strings.

197
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,773
Robots.

198
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,525
I love smashing robots!

199
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,236
No, you've got something more important to do.

200
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,446
Search this prison and find Kalibak.

201
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,115
Will you two be Al...

202
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,323
Okay.

203
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,054
Come on, ugly, move that hairy butt.

204
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,267
It's humiliating to be rescued by your enemy.

205
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:33,228
<i>As humiliating as being Virman Vundabar's pet?</i>

206
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:38,317
Well, if it isn't my treacherous stepbrother.

207
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,444
And his cow.

208
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,195
Arrogant worm. How dare you...

209
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,656
Knock it off! What are you guys, 12?

210
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,159
I can't believe I'm the mature one here.

211
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,661
He's right. We've got bigger problems.

212
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,332
Indeed you do, fools. Much bigger.

213
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,835
And, oh, ha ha, how I will delight in watching you fail.

214
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:05,260
Very interesting... but futile.

215
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,389
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

216
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,102
At least for the moment.

217
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,164
Again and again you try, Scott.

218
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,209
And again and again Granny stops you.

219
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,752
Give up.

220
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,631
Give in to hate and hopelessness.

221
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,383
Give in to Granny.

222
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:47,386
I'd rather die.

223
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,471
If that's your preference.

224
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,527
Go!

225
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,281
Come on, Scott.

226
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,543
Scott! Scott!

227
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:22,963
<i>Enjoying your bath, Mr. Miracle?</i>

228
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,633
<i>Here at</i> Casa de Vundabar, <i>we provide everything</i>

229
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,553
<i>including your very last breath.</i>

230
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,398
Uh-h-h.

231
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,236
You think you're so special, Scott.

232
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,821
That you're different from

233
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,991
Granny's other children. But you're not.

234
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,995
If anything, you're just a little... slower.

235
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,997
You see, they learned years ago

236
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,082
that their lives are meaningless.

237
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,501
That hope is a lie.

238
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,963
And you've just figured it out.

239
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,632
No, you're the liar.

240
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,926
There's always hope.

241
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,304
You'll never escape.

242
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:15,974
Yes... I... will!

243
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,945
He'll get me out of this.

244
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,434
I know he'll get me out of this.

245
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,245
Don't worry. He gets out of everything, right?

246
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,454
So far.

247
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:04,064
Saved by a female.

248
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:05,315
Guess you better drop him.

249
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,691
- Huh! - Kidding!

250
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,193
<i>Got room for one more?</i>

251
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,032
There's a shortcut at the bottom.

252
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,826
Wait a minute, how did you get out of that water thing?

253
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,161
Trade secret.

254
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,211
The whole world is a prison, you dum-dums

255
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,922
and escape is not an option.

256
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
<i>Voila,</i> the way out.

257
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,233
Now what?

258
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:51,319
Now... we make miracles.

259
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,215
No, no, no, allow me.

260
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,726
Flash!

261
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,605
What?

262
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:30,900
Don't be so cocky.

263
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,069
Vundabar's not done with us yet.

264
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,077
- Hope you're happy. - Indeed, I am.

265
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,516
- Shouldn't we... - And spoil their fun?

266
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:16,154
There's only one way to stop them now.

267
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,740
Blow up the entire complex.

268
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,621
<i>Ten...</i>

269
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:25,829
<i>nine...</i>

270
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:26,997
<i>eight...</i>

271
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
<i>seven...</i>

272
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,668
Not liking the sound of that.

273
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:30,876
<i>five...</i>

274
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,253
<i>four...</i>

275
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,505
<i>three...</i>

276
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:34,839
<i>two...</i>

277
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,048
<i>one.</i>

278
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,743
Oh, Scott, you didn't let Granny down.

279
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,621
When I heard the X-Pit had been destroyed

280
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,959
I thought for certain you and dear Kalibak were lost.

281
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,294
How did you manage to get out?

282
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,503
Ask him.

283
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,547
Trade secret.

284
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:18,258
Enough of this. Where is Oberon?

285
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,218
Ah, yes

286
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,431
that mouthy little pipsqueak was very rude to Granny.

287
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,516
And he's going to be taught a lesson.

288
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,351
See? What'd I tell you?

289
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,228
People are so predictable.

290
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,316
Try not to think about where

291
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,985
you've got Oberon hidden.

292
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,778
Uh, uh-h-h...

293
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,197
Darkseid's old palace. I'll guide you.

294
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,999
He's safe.

295
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,169
Good, because now I can...

296
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,421
I'm sorry, but you can't.

297
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,090
The power struggle must continue here.

298
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,342
A curse on both their houses.

299
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,594
Indeed.

300
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,932
Feel free to applaud at any time.

301
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,143
Ah, it's good to see you, old friend.

302
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:11,936
It's good to see me too.

303
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,545
All the trouble we had to go through

304
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,482
because of you.

305
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,568
All legs and no heart.

306
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,612
You're just too far away to hear it.

307
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,748
How?

308
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,793
Granny never failed with any of them.

309
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:37,128
How did she fail with him?

310
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,297
Oh, one last thing.

311
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:58,191
- Flash? - Yeah, I know, I know.

312
00:21:58,399 --> 00:21:59,734
I went behind your back.

313
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,611
But look how everything turned out.

314
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,112
<i>We boomed back here for you</i>

315
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,697
the switch went off perfectly

316
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,626
and now we've got Kalibak locked up on Earth

317
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,076
where neither side can use him.

318
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:09,494
- You don't... - So, yeah.

319
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:10,829
I did go behind your back.

320
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:12,037
But you know what?

321
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,456
I'd do it again.

322
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,124
What do you say to that, big guy?

323
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,211
I was only going to ask

324
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,088
if you wanted to play brawlin' bots?

325
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,550
Dibs on the green one.

326
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,929
I wanted the green one.
