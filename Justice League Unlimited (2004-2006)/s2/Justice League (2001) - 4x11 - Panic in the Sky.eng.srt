1
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,924
<i>Previously on "Justice League Unlimited..."</i>

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:09,759
What's the worst-case scenario?

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:11,527
If they've got enough to tie you to this

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,179
they'll head right for your doorstep.

5
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:16,641
I wouldn't worry about the Justice League quite yet.

6
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,559
<i>They have problems of their own.</i>

7
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,353
Binary fusion generator

8
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,231
<i>initialization sequence in progress.</i>

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,451
<i>- What did we hit? - Cadmus headquarters.</i>

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,871
<i>This was retaliation, sir. Pure and simple.</i>

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,415
We captured The Question, they bust him out

12
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,460
<i>and an hour later, it's death from above.</i>

13
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,869
I'm glad we could lend a hand.

14
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,255
If you care so much

15
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,674
why did you shoot at us in the first place?

16
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:50,967
We didn't... I...

17
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:55,930
Your mission is to take down the Justice League.

18
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>You're going to need help.</i>

19
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,672
Hold still, Galatea.

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,049
You're invulnerable.

21
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,217
This can't possibly be hurting you.

22
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,470
Boredom is my kryptonite.

23
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,639
Okay, actually, kryptonite is my kryptonite.

24
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,265
But you know what I mean.

25
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,392
Although, the way I'm feeling lately

26
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,145
I don't think even that stuff can hurt me anymore.

27
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,354
Think again.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,606
I've artificially aged

29
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,733
your body to its physical prime.

30
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,943
But your underlying DNA matrix

31
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,363
is still a clone of Supergirl's.

32
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,907
I'm better than she ever was.

33
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,450
Be careful with that.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,419
It gives you remote control over the Ultimen.

35
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:44,413
The new generation of Ultimen are blank slates.

36
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,208
They don't think except to follow your commands.

37
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,877
They have no initiative and they feel no pain.

38
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,797
<i>When this light is on, the Ultimen are in puppet mode.</i>

39
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,800
They're little more than an extension of your will.

40
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,008
Wicked.

41
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,304
It's time we got the show on the road.

42
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,390
Report to the staging area.

43
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,147
What?

44
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,691
Nothing.

45
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,445
Goodbye, daddy.

46
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,337
Long-range communications back on line at least.

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,631
How long before you can restore full power?

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,880
Atom's still down in the reactor room working on it.

49
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,928
He thinks he can shave 20 minutes off the system reboot.

50
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,097
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

51
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:46,142
- <i>Is this thing on?</i> - It is now. Go ahead, Flash.

52
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,060
The evacuation's going okay.

53
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,396
Lots of minor injuries, but no casualties.

54
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:51,814
They were fortunate.

55
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,107
<i>That's not how they see it.</i>

56
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,358
They're pretty mad.

57
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,360
They think it's our fault, J'onn.

58
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,129
Do what you can to keep a lid on things.

59
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,572
I'll send additional help.

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,324
I wouldn't. They're scared of us as it is.

61
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,219
If we can help it, we should try not to look

62
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,870
<i>like an invading army, you know?</i>

63
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,038
Agreed. Keep me updated.

64
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,041
Continuing coverage live from Covenant, New Mexico

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,850
where a huge explosion has caused tremors

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,670
detected as far away as Japan.

67
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,589
<i>Although many agree that in the instance</i>

68
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:18,632
<i>before the explosion they saw an energy beam</i>

69
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,134
<i>strike from the sky.</i>

70
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,342
Turn it off.

71
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,012
Our sensors are still out.

72
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,847
This is the only information available.

73
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,894
Diana, John, Shayera, meet me in the main conference room.

74
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,312
Now.

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,147
You, too, J'onn.

76
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,909
- What have we done? - We haven't done anything.

77
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:48,496
An outside force took control of the binary fusion generator.

78
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,206
<i>Whoever's behind that is responsible</i>

79
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,958
for the destruction of Cadmus. Not us.

80
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,377
Tell that to all those people in New Mexico.

81
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,838
They're <i>terrified</i> of us. So is the government.

82
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,174
We can't let that stop us from doing our job.

83
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,842
We aren't here to be liked.

84
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,053
We're here to make the world a safer place.

85
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:07,264
- How are we doing so far today? - Come on, man!

86
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,725
I don't see the two goals as mutually exclusive.

87
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,353
We should make a gesture of cooperation.

88
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,063
That's not a bad idea.

89
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,315
We could dismantle the binary fusion generator.

90
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,400
At least until our innocence has been proven.

91
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,236
I've seen it on a hundred worlds.

92
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,823
Space-based weapons always destabilize planetary politics.

93
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,991
Okay, getting rid of that thing is a start.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,077
But it's not going to be enough.

95
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,120
We have to regain their trust.

96
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,334
Then there's only one thing to do.

97
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,711
<i>I need some light over here.</i>

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,630
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

99
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,298
I have an announcement to make.

100
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,427
Until it's been proven that we aren't responsible

101
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,010
for the tragedy in New Mexico

102
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,097
the founding members are turning ourselves in to US custody.

103
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,140
- What? - That's insane!

104
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,601
- You can't do that. - No way.

105
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,020
Cooperate fully with the investigation.

106
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,939
Give them whatever they ask for.

107
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,316
But, Clark... Superman...

108
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,193
Hold the fort, Kara.

109
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,279
We're counting on you.

110
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:04,697
All of you.

111
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,831
You want me to what?

112
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,833
Turn yourself over in to US custody.

113
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,376
Along with the rest of us.

114
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,420
Yeah, that makes sense, okay.

115
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,388
Meet us at the coordinates I'm sending first.

116
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,882
We should all go over together.

117
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,010
This is the single dumbest plan I've ever heard.

118
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,345
<i>If you're feeling guilty, clear your own name.</i>

119
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,847
Don't stand on the sidelines

120
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,599
waiting for somebody else to do it.

121
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,851
We've already voted. Five in favor.

122
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,561
Six.

123
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,730
You <i>have</i> to come with us, Bruce.

124
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,732
I don't <i>have</i> to do anything.

125
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm a part-timer, remember?

126
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,321
Actually, he took it a lot better than I'd expected.

127
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,016
As promised, we're surrendering ourselves to your authority.

128
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,018
- Where's Batman? - Running late.

129
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,811
The Batmobile, it lost a wheel.

130
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,480
The Joker got away.

131
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,442
That's what I heard.

132
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,281
<i>Those won't be necessary.</i>

133
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,616
It's standard procedure.

134
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:33,535
This isn't a standard situation, son.

135
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,999
I don't think it would've held them anyway.

136
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,757
<i>This bites!</i>

137
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,234
They shouldn't have to go to prison.

138
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:49,385
They're the good guys.

139
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,803
It's the right thing to do.

140
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,681
How do you figure?

141
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,158
<i>We've got no business scaring people</i>

142
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,517
<i>any more than we already have.</i>

143
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:59,019
This will help take some of the pressure off.

144
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,647
Nobody really believes we did this.

145
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,482
I'm not so sure that's true.

146
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,411
But as soon as the watchtower's back on line

147
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,486
we've got 60 guys champing at the bit

148
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,613
to find out who's really behind it all.

149
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,949
I'm worried about them, Steel.

150
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:14,952
- I'm worried about my cousin. - Don't be.

151
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,162
Everybody in the League is good at their job.

152
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,749
But those seven, they're the best ever.

153
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,085
Not because they're the most powerful, they aren't.

154
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:24,670
Not all of 'em.

155
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,678
<i>And it's not just because they were the first.</i>

156
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,258
<i>It's because they're special.</i>

157
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,343
They've proven it time and again.

158
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,388
They make the hard choices. They set the example.

159
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:37,266
They do what's right, not what's easiest.

160
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,601
And they always come out on top.

161
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,479
They're gonna be okay, Kara.

162
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,273
We all are.

163
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,609
You guys see that?

164
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,572
Something coming up from planet side.

165
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,826
Uh, Javelins, maybe?

166
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,789
Not Javelins.

167
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,624
They almost look like...

168
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,254
missiles.

169
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,351
I'm counting two dozen Damocles-Class Missiles.

170
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,979
That's LexCorp technology.

171
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,231
Battle stations, prepare for impact!

172
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,965
Come on, let's get out of here.

173
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,738
Ultimen, keep the League off of me.

174
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,699
Sanitize the watchtower.

175
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,296
We've got business, Waller.

176
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,889
You told me once that you were a patriot.

177
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:24,224
Well, it's time to step up.

178
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,869
You have to know that the Justice League

179
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,895
would never have fired that weapon at you.

180
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,103
Sure you would.

181
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,564
It was retaliation for kidnapping

182
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,107
your man, The Question.

183
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,859
And yet you weren't home.

184
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,320
We've had you under surveillance for months.

185
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,530
You don't think we saw you evacuate your offices?

186
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,783
- A warning shot, then. - Don't be dense.

187
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,536
<i>Someone took over our fusion cannon by remote control.</i>

188
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,413
There are maybe three people on earth

189
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,873
smart enough to pull that off.

190
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,083
Two of them were already on the watchtower.

191
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,460
And that leaves...

192
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,045
Luthor.

193
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,172
That's where you're trying to lead me, right?

194
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,383
- You're too smart to trust him. - Who says I do?

195
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,136
He provides off-the-books funding for Cadmus.

196
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,473
As far as I'm concerned, that's all he's good for.

197
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:06,892
Then you <i>must</i> know he's got his own agenda.

198
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,310
He wants to be President.

199
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:09,798
That's agenda enough for anybody.

200
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:11,813
Almost anybody.

201
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,234
If I were you, I'd start looking at him... hard.

202
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,528
<i>Aa-ah! Uh-oh.</i>

203
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,834
Something's wrong in the reactor room.

204
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,602
- I'll be right back. - Take care of it.

205
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,170
We'll handle these guys.

206
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,815
Urgh!

207
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,838
Steel, everything okay down here?

208
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,301
Ray?

209
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,074
Put him down!

210
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,494
Sure. I was pretty much done with him, anyway.

211
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,206
What do you think you're doing?

212
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,625
Oh, I'm about to set the reactor to overload

213
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,128
and blow the watchtower to bits.

214
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,547
But what I'm hoping, is that you'll be dumb enough

215
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,424
to try and stop me.

216
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,696
Huh! Ha. Ha!

217
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,002
Uh-oh. What's wrong, hero?

218
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,837
Not strong enough?

219
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,882
Maybe that's because I'm the real hero here.

220
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,302
Your Justice League is a bunch of dangerous loose cannons

221
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,513
and I'm going to shut you down.

222
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,556
Who do you think you're kidding?

223
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,642
You don't care about what the League does.

224
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,061
Admit it. You just wanna beat me.

225
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,318
I've already beaten you.

226
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,654
But I'm going to make it last.

227
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,030
You know what?

228
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,032
No matter how bad you beat me

229
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,076
I'm real, not a clone.

230
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,327
Shut up.

231
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,496
Deep down, you know the truth.

232
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,332
You're not a person, you're just a weapon

233
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,876
<i>grown out of one of Hamilton's Petri dishes.</i>

234
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,336
Shut up!

235
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:29,548
He played me.

236
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,259
I knew he was a snake, and I still let him bite me.

237
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,722
He's recently had copies

238
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,476
of a lot of our new technology shipped to LexCorp.

239
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,478
<i>That's what he's stolen, professor.</i>

240
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,231
<i>Could he have taken control of the watchtower weapons system</i>

241
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,149
<i>with that stuff?</i>

242
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,526
Theoretically, yes.

243
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,778
But that's the least of it.

244
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,613
Good Lord, I think, I know

245
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,906
what he's planning to do.

246
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,167
Pitiful.

247
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,505
- What? - The mission is scrubbed.

248
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,007
Do you hear me?

249
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:14,217
<i>Stand down and await further instructions.</i>

250
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,553
I'm not reading you. Can you repeat?

251
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:19,431
Don't do this, Galatea! The mission's over!

252
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,683
<i>Call off the Ultimen. Do you hear me?</i>

253
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,018
<i>Call...</i>

254
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:24,603
Wrong number.

255
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,940
Urgh!

256
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,708
Kara...

257
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,085
power reboot in 18 seconds.

258
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,378
Right.

259
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,839
Ha!

260
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,984
When I get rid of you, I'll be the only...

261
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,208
- Yeah! - Yeah!

262
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,253
- Aw! - Oh!

263
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,924
Somebody blow a fuse down there?

264
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,217
I'll say.

265
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,770
Now you're perfect!

266
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:52,732
A perfect superpowerful immortal body.

267
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,359
A suitable place for me

268
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,611
to spend the rest of eternity.

269
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,113
Ironic.

270
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,156
Years of plotting, hundreds of millions spent

271
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,950
on Cadmus R&D projects

272
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:03,660
and none of it bore fruit.

273
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,705
Now, it's a lonely employee of LexCorp

274
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:09,416
Dr. lvo, creator of Amazo

275
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:12,669
who we have to thank for my impending godhood.

276
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,004
<i>That was the last piece I needed.</i>

277
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,923
Got it all figured out, have you?

278
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,234
When you and Atom worked together

279
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,259
to stop the first Amazo

280
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,136
he showed you the blueprints.

281
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,555
<i>And I suspect, you have a photographic memory.</i>

282
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,056
I'm too modest to boast.

283
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,058
The real purpose of Cadmus

284
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,144
was to give <i>you</i> super powers.

285
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,813
And to ruin Superman's reputation.

286
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,648
Imagine how sweet it will be

287
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,150
when I save the world

288
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,527
from the menace of the Justice League.

289
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,863
Now, when I kill Superman

290
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,823
they'll build statues in my honor.

291
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,783
Maybe next time.

292
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,497
That... was uncalled for.

293
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,355
<i>Hey, Lex!</i>

294
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,901
That android is Cadmus property.

295
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,669
You're gonna have to find somewhere else

296
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,154
to keep your brain.

297
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,950
A nano-disassembler beam.

298
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,952
Your design, I believe.

299
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,704
Arrogant cow!

300
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,707
It'll take weeks to build myself another android body.

301
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,751
You ain't got weeks, baldy.

302
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,399
You're under arrest for trying to use

303
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,379
the Justice League's space gun

304
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,632
to murder everyone at Cadmus.

305
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,137
Did you really think

306
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,307
you could take me down all by yourself?

307
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,434
Actually, yeah.

308
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,103
But on the off chance, I might have been wrong.

309
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,399
Ta-da!

310
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,736
It's over, Lex.

311
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,196
Not until l...

312
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,002
I'd hoped to remain hidden

313
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:22,465
until I could install myself into the android.

314
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,385
But you forced my hand.

315
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:26,803
Brainiac?
