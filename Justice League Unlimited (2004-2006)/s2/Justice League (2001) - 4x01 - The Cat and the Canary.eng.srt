1
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,138
Alright, move it. Let's get this stuff out of here.

2
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,396
Wildcat, it's Black Canary.

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,774
I'm at the warehouse. where are you?

4
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,193
<i>Sorry, baby. Ooh! I got hung up.</i>

5
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,529
This is getting old, Ted. Need a hand?

6
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,159
Nah. Just sit tight. I'll be there in ten minutes.

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,703
Will those be real minutes or Wildcat minutes?

8
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,247
Hey, come on.

9
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,503
Over there.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,757
<i>And there's that merciless left jab.</i>

11
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,218
Larry, we interrupting your private life?

12
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,804
Pay-per-view Webcast. It's almost over.

13
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:56,597
Put it down and get to work.

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,350
Dude, the last one with this guy only went one round.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,228
I'm not missing it. It cost me an arm and a leg.

16
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,436
I'm gonna cost you an arm and a leg if you don't...

17
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,359
Whoa!

18
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,820
Things are about to get ugly here, folks.

19
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:14,240
Kind of late for a charity drop-off, isn't it, boys?

20
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,506
<i>What a spectacle!</i>

21
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,384
<i>You're seeing a living legend in action</i>

22
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,393
<i>It's almost too awful to watch.</i>

23
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,438
Move it!

24
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,434
<i>We may have a knockout in record...</i>

25
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,428
<i>I don't think this one's getting up again.</i>

26
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,681
<i>And that means we have a winner.</i>

27
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,392
Still the undefeated champ...

28
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:28,064
Wildcat!

29
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,182
Most people after they sold a company

30
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,310
for three billion dollars would just kick back and relax.

31
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,645
I'm not most people.

32
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,439
Besides, after taxes and the lawyers

33
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,023
are through with you...

34
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,317
you're lucky if you see a billion and a half.

35
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,069
My heart bleeds.

36
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:00,865
- Black Canary. - Green Arrow.

37
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,533
I've noticed you around.

38
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,868
I know.

39
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,327
You happy punching the bag

40
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,122
or you want to go a few rounds with me?

41
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,166
I am talking about sparring.

42
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:11,709
That'd be nice, too.

43
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,010
You're telegraphing.

44
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,636
You got to center yourself.

45
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,221
Center myself. Got it.

46
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,279
You're good.

47
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,323
You should see me when I'm trying.

48
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,783
I'd like that.

49
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,910
In fact, I could use your help on something

50
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,286
but the league can't know.

51
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,121
I'll explain once we're on the surface.

52
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,749
I don't know. Sounds fishy.

53
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,876
I promise, it's for a good cause.

54
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,837
How about a wager?

55
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,548
If I can get out of this hold, you help me.

56
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,343
Deal.

57
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:10,142
I'll drive.

58
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,360
You can hold on to me if you want.

59
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,572
So tell me about Wildcat.

60
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,242
What's so secret you couldn't talk about it in the Watchtower?

61
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,743
He's doing meta-brawls.

62
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,662
Illegal, no-holds barred cage fighting.

63
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,205
Mostly super-powered criminals

64
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,082
or guys with chemical enhancements.

65
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,335
Only rule, they fight till one guy stays down.

66
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,628
Why's he doing it?

67
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,963
He loves to fight.

68
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,331
Before he was Wildcat, he was

69
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,341
the world heavyweight boxing champ.

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,678
I remember, but doesn't he get enough fighting in the league?

71
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,972
I think the league's part of the problem.

72
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,420
It's like he's going through some kind of midlife crisis.

73
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,102
I'm worried something's gonna happen to him.

74
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,659
Roulette... I need a word.

75
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,619
Anything for my star.

76
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,081
I've come to a decision. I'm not gonna fight anymore.

77
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,624
What brought this on?

78
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,084
It's interfering with my work

79
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,044
and I've been letting my friends down.

80
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,797
Hmm. You mean the Justice League?

81
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,591
That's right.

82
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,301
The timing's a shame.

83
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,262
Atomic Skull's in town and he wanted a shot at you.

84
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,681
But don't worry. I'll tell him you quit.

85
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,308
Knock it off.

86
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,160
I know what you're doing and it's not gonna work.

87
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,061
I've already made up my mind.

88
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,439
Well, you're a good man, Cat.

89
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,816
You care about the right things.

90
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,319
I can't fault you for being loyal to the league.

91
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,196
I just have a hard time understanding it.

92
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,574
What's so hard about it?

93
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:51,493
Well, you must have to swallow a lot of pride

94
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,121
being one of the only normal humans in the group.

95
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,250
No superpowers, not even a pile of gadgets like Batman's.

96
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,252
You want out of this, fine.

97
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,421
But if you want to stay where people respect you

98
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,049
where you're the king, then don't go.

99
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,453
If you can't swing it, there's

100
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,895
a lot of fish in the ocean

101
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,343
You know what I'm saying, babe?

102
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,400
- I need a $1000. - For what?

103
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,086
We can't just go to some big sports arena

104
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,110
for this kind of thing.

105
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,529
The location's a secret.

106
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,938
For a grand, this guy gives us the info and a ticket in.

107
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,037
Well, at least now I understand why you brought me along.

108
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:38,290
You didn't need Green Arrow you just needed green.

109
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,000
It isn't like that.

110
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,753
No? Then tell me, what's it like?

111
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,214
I thought I could trust you.

112
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,137
Man, good guy to have on a date.

113
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,973
A thousand, was it?

114
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,062
Actually, that was just for one ticket.

115
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,940
If you're both going, it's two.

116
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,576
50K on Atomic Skull.

117
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,537
<i>All that cash against Wildcat?</i>

118
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,872
<i>Keeps it interesting. You never know.</i>

119
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,791
<i>Twenty says the Cat crushes the Skull.</i>

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,926
This way.

121
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah?

122
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,902
What is this?

123
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,320
We want to help you, Ted.

124
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,156
We want to get you out of here.

125
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,074
Why? Does it look like I have a problem?

126
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,493
You do if you don't see what you've become here.

127
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,142
You're entertainment for these people

128
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,997
the rooster in a cock fight.

129
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,999
Fighting is what I do, alright?

130
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,585
It's all I was ever good at and I'm still good at it.

131
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,963
I'm Wildcat, the guy who fights.

132
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,256
That's what I am.

133
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,509
You're so much more than that.

134
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,929
Anyway, I can leave anytime I want.

135
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,556
I don't need help.

136
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,225
Then leave. Right now.

137
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:22,965
I'm fighting Atomic Skull tonight

138
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,730
and you know he deserves a beating.

139
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:27,066
Ted, come on.

140
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,554
Hey, I was the greatest, alright?

141
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,277
I fought 'em all and I beat 'em all.

142
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,570
And now look at me.

143
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,139
Most of the time they keep me up in

144
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,074
that stupid spaceship baby-sitting.

145
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:37,701
They call me to do real work less and less.

146
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,620
Don't you think I see where this is going?

147
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:42,331
I mean, I don't shoot beams from my eyes, I...

148
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,999
I can't turn myself invisible.

149
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,168
I don't even have a supersonic bird call.

150
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,879
So that's it?

151
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,408
You're angry at people with powers

152
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,966
and down here you get to beat on them?

153
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,302
Am I getting too close now?

154
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,387
Hey, settle down!

155
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,099
How's this your business, huh?

156
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,307
Stay out of it, Ollie.

157
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,268
That's it. I'm done.

158
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,774
What are you putting me in the middle of this for?

159
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:11,318
You guys obviously have your own stuff to work out.

160
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,527
What stuff?

161
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,363
I'm trying to help a friend.

162
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,990
That sure looked like you were more than friends.

163
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,785
Did you think? Ted is like a father to me.

164
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,037
He trained me, trained a lot of us in the league

165
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,624
and kept an eye on us when we were starting out. I owe him.

166
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,960
Now I guess training isn't enough anymore.

167
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,646
So you want to get him out of this quietly

168
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,630
<i>cause you don't want him thrown out of the league?</i>

169
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,923
Or worse.

170
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,136
Alright. But I saw the look in his eye.

171
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,595
He's not gonna budge.

172
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,223
Then I hope I can count on you for plan B.

173
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,853
Uh, there's no place to change.

174
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,229
Right here'll do.

175
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,528
You drop something?

176
00:10:56,613 --> 00:11:01,869
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Meta-brawl!

177
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,246
<i>Place your bets and take your seats.</i>

178
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:09,710
<i>Get ready for the historic match-up...</i>

179
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:12,588
<i>the clash of titans...</i>

180
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:15,549
<i>between Atomic Skull...</i>

181
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,387
<i>and Wildcat!</i>

182
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,904
Show's over, folks.

183
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:20,864
Forever.

184
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:01,153
- Hey! - Hey.

185
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:02,823
- Hey! - Let us out of here!

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,669
- Think we can take 'em? - No.

187
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:17,921
Hold it!

188
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,631
Just what do you think you're doing?

189
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,276
If the only way to get you out of here

190
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,885
is to take this place down, then so be it.

191
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,680
You better decide who's side you're on.

192
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,532
Sorry about getting you into this.

193
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,825
Forget the apology.

194
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,910
Just do that sonic scream of yours.

195
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,413
I can't. At this range, it would kill them.

196
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,290
I have a better idea.

197
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,626
How would you like to see two League members fight each other?

198
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,378
Me and Wildcat?

199
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,130
In the cage right now.

200
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,049
That make you some money?

201
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:04,634
Oh, definitely.

202
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,428
Then here's the deal.

203
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:10,349
If I win, you ban Wildcat from cage fighting forever.

204
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,018
And if I lose, I'll never bother you again.

205
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,603
Forget it.

206
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:18,190
Can't do that, Cat. It's much too good an idea.

207
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,816
Everything's okay, folks.

208
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,069
In fact, it's fabulous.

209
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,154
Because after a brief intermission

210
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,532
Wildcat is going to fight Black Canary.

211
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,661
<i>That's right, two good guys fighting each other.</i>

212
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,497
<i>And one of them's her.</i>

213
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,296
So place your bets.

214
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,969
Give our new contender a dressing room

215
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,639
and keep them both in it until showtime.

216
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:58,855
I'm not doing it.

217
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,504
I only fight guys who have it coming.

218
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,775
That's all I've ever done.

219
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,610
Or so you've told yourself.

220
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,904
The truth is you love the fight.

221
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,656
Well, I'm not going to love beating up

222
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,533
one of my own students, that ain't right.

223
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,702
If you trained her, she can take care of herself.

224
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,746
She knew what she was getting into.

225
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,248
<i>And if you don't do this</i>

226
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,875
I'll never let you fight in that cage again.

227
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,545
And I expect you to win no matter what.

228
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:24,965
Don't take a fall. Don't even go easy on her.

229
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:29,261
You're still my star attraction and I need you undefeated.

230
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:32,264
Ruin that and I'll put you out to pasture

231
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,266
as quickly as the league.

232
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:36,143
<i>Are we clear?</i>

233
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,735
Well, you bought us some time

234
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,213
but it still looks like we're gonna

235
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,613
have to fight our way out of here.

236
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,741
Changed your mind about using the scream?

237
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,993
You don't understand.

238
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,120
If we leave here without Wildcat or worse

239
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,955
if I use my power to force him out

240
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,582
he'll just come back.

241
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,209
We have to settle this the only way he understands.

242
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,086
You're not really gonna fight him?

243
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,046
I have to. And beat him.

244
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,466
It's the only way to make him stop.

245
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:10,177
I thought that was just you pretending again.

246
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,803
What's that supposed to mean?

247
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,473
Like all that flirting you did up at the Watchtower

248
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,684
the way you acted interested to get me to come with you.

249
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,644
Who said that was pretending?

250
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,481
Oh, no. I know your game now.

251
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,858
It's not always a game.

252
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,359
No? Come here.

253
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,070
Look me in the eye and say so.

254
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,958
Don't worry. You'll still get your main event.

255
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,506
Ladies and gentlemen

256
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:50,759
<i>prepare yourselves for the world's first cage fight</i>

257
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,469
<i>between two heroes</i>

258
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,138
<i>right here at Meta-brawl.</i>

259
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,520
However, there's been a change in the program.

260
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,730
<i>Instead of Black Canary</i>

261
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,944
<i>Wildcat will be fighting Green Arrow.</i>

262
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:10,862
There's no way. I'm not fighting him.

263
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,490
Canary could have held her own, but not this guy.

264
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,242
You'll fight who I tell you to fight.

265
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,785
End of story.

266
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,879
What's the matter, Cat? Afraid?

267
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,339
He's not a fighter.

268
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,634
I know what it is.

269
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:35,428
Maybe you'd rather fight a woman.

270
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,941
That idiot.

271
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,250
Arrow!

272
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,505
What do you think you're doing?

273
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,966
Teaching the teacher a lesson.

274
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,769
Wildcat, stop it!

275
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,229
He asked for it.

276
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,234
So when are you gonna start, has-been?

277
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,870
Yeah!

278
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
I don't have any powers.

279
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,762
And you're still too old to knock me out.

280
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,489
You had enough, smart guy? Huh?

281
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,617
Get up. I'm not done.

282
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,104
What have you done?

283
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,314
<i>I'll tell you what he's done</i>

284
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,067
he's taken the fights to a whole new level.

285
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,955
Think of the word that'll spread from this.

286
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,904
Anything's possible here.

287
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,824
Next time you fight we'll clear millions!

288
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,202
No. No, I'm out.

289
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,872
And this time, I mean it.

290
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:20,051
You know, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do

291
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,347
not to mention arrogant, pig-headed, macho and...

292
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
very, very sweet.

293
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,900
- I'm sorry. - I'm not.

294
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,109
Huh!

295
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,403
It's a stunner.

296
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,989
Puts you in metabolic stasis for a few minutes.

297
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:44,451
You wanted him to see what it would feel like to kill someone.

298
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,870
Think it worked?

299
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,456
It worked.

300
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,502
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>

301
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,838
You won't be happy stuck on that ship.

302
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,090
I give you a month and you'll be back here

303
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,217
crying for me to give you another chance.

304
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,596
Mark my words, Wildcat, I know your kind

305
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:06,598
and you will fight again.

306
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,518
Of course he will. Just not here.

307
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:40,965
I'm sorry for what I put you through.

308
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,636
But don't worry, seeing a dead body from my hands

309
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:47,222
it knocked me back to my senses.

310
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,725
I believe you, but I'd like some assurance it's gonna stick.

311
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Excuse me?

312
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:54,896
Things like this sometimes

313
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:56,689
you can't stop all by yourself

314
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,191
no matter how much you want to.

315
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,279
Believe me, fighting's nowhere near

316
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,114
as tough as this is gonna be.

317
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,331
<i>How's he doing?</i>

318
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,041
He'll make it. How about you?

319
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,251
You recovering okay?

320
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,459
I've had worse.

321
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,838
I wouldn't brag about that.

322
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:22,757
Care to join me for a cup of coffee?

323
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,384
Yeah.

324
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,970
Good. You're buying.
