1
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,431
Here is where I make my stand!

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,559
Here is where I shall carve out the kingdom

3
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,603
I am destined for!

4
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,570
Bow before the power of Mantis!

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Whoa!

6
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,700
Get out of the way!

7
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,706
Is it me, or are the world conquerors getting mouthier?

8
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,915
He's from Apocalypse.

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,043
They're all pretty chatty there.

10
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,132
Move it!

11
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:31,257
Bow down before your better, Man Of Steel.

12
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,511
What's the story on this guy?

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,263
Civil war back on his home planet.

14
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,515
Guess, he thought things would be easier here.

15
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,933
Bad call.

16
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:52,403
Captain Atom!

17
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,947
I'm okay. It'll just take me a moment

18
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,532
to adjust to the energy.

19
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,421
What in Sam Hill is that?

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,881
A boom tube.

21
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,424
An extra-dimensional doorway

22
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,800
back to Apocalypse.

23
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,844
Got it. Duck.

24
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,602
- Nice work, Captain. - Thanks.

25
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,650
But what's stopping him from coming right back?

26
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,105
You mean, besides this?

27
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,443
Superman!

28
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,782
Lois Lane, "Daily Planet."

29
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,617
Yeah, Lois, I know.

30
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,762
Would you care to comment on what just happened here?

31
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,579
I'd like an interview.

32
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,539
One on one.

33
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,028
I'm pretty sure there's something

34
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,543
I have to do someplace.

35
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,752
You're late.

36
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,713
- I was busy. - Like I wasn't?

37
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,591
But I've already written the story up and filed it.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,426
So now that we're both off the clock?

39
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,101
Captain Adams.

40
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,979
Captain Nathaniel Adams.

41
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,691
General Eiling, sir, what brings you...

42
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,901
- What's this? - Orders.

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,695
Your commission has been reactivated.

44
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,196
You're back in the Air Force.

45
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,782
I'm committed to the Justice League now, sir.

46
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,035
You also made a commitment to the service, captain.

47
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,162
Seems to me, you've got a decision to make.

48
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,568
Seems like I never see you anymore.

49
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,903
It's been a while.

50
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,030
That's why I'm trying to make today special.

51
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:42,238
Where are we going?

52
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:43,532
You'll see.

53
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,460
- What do you think? - A picnic?

54
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,979
I suppose, your high school sweetheart

55
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:59,048
loved this kind of cornball stuff.

56
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:01,091
As a matter of fact, she did.

57
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,763
I've been worried about you.

58
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,640
It's a dangerous job, Lois

59
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,600
but you know I can take care of myself.

60
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,144
There's more than one way to get hurt.

61
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,230
You remember what happened to your reputation

62
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,190
when you were under Darkseid's control.

63
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,858
That was years ago.

64
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,820
People haven't forgotten, not everybody.

65
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,905
- I know. - Do you?

66
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:26,575
The way you and the League have been acting lately.

67
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,286
Look, I'm a reporter, not a public relations person.

68
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,330
But with all the muscle you guys throw around

69
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,040
you're starting to scare me.

70
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,792
I'll admit, we've got a lot of power

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,919
but we only use it to help.

72
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,407
Like when you and Captain Marvel

73
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,881
wrecked Lexor city on National Television?

74
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,370
Or maybe you mean, when you fired

75
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,134
that big space gun in the desert?

76
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,803
We come on a little strong sometimes

77
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,596
but it's for the people's own good.

78
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,307
That sounds like something Lex would say.

79
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,642
Don't even joke about that.

80
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,811
I'm nothing like Lex Luthor.

81
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,396
Of course you're not.

82
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,284
I'm just saying, you can't serve the public

83
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,566
without their confidence.

84
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,150
It's a question of trust.

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,156
So, what's for dessert?

86
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:15,332
You really know how to show a girl a good time, Q.

87
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,754
When are we going out on a real date?

88
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,132
Shh! Trying to concentrate.

89
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,259
I'm not even in the Justice League anymore.

90
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,802
You're lucky to have me along.

91
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,847
Hardly. You're drawn to my eccentric charm.

92
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,645
Finished.

93
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,564
- Me, too. - Not quite.

94
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,192
You get what you came for?

95
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,777
I believe so.

96
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,589
If there's a link between Luthor and Cadmus

97
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,156
I'll find it here.

98
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,700
Which leaves the rest of our evening tantalizingly free.

99
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,827
There are three terabytes of data here.

100
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,621
I'll be busy for days.

101
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,627
Dinner and a movie?

102
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,086
It's a start.

103
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,389
Take off your chest plate.

104
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,266
You don't need it.

105
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,727
What are you doing? I'll die without this.

106
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,271
- The cancer! - Is gone, Lex.

107
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,606
You're in remission.

108
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,316
No. That's not accurate.

109
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,901
There's no trace of the disease.

110
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,653
As if it were never there.

111
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:27,404
That's preposterous.

112
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,490
You've got the body of a 20-year-old

113
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:32,326
and you don't have cancer.

114
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,828
- How? - I don't know.

115
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,122
It might be the vest.

116
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,691
It might be an unexpected effect of the kryptonite poisoning

117
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,628
that gave you the disease in the first place.

118
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,089
I'll continue to study the...

119
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,133
I'm in the middle of my physical, Mrs. Waller.

120
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,260
You might be in the middle of a Hornet's Nest.

121
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,429
Question and Huntress have copied files

122
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,099
from a high-security Cadmus Terminal.

123
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,433
What did they get?

124
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,978
Tech support can't tell for certain.

125
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,437
Maybe everything.

126
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,718
For all our sakes, we'd better hope

127
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,528
that the encryption on those files

128
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,446
is as good as we've been told.

129
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:27,881
Finally, the connection between Cadmus and Luthor.

130
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,135
<i>Or something better.</i>

131
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,803
<i>"'President Luthor."</i>

132
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,271
Oh, no. No, no.

133
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,778
It's all connected.

134
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,114
Not alternate reality.

135
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,782
Time loop.

136
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,119
Luthor becomes President, Flash is killed.

137
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,121
Superman kills Luthor in retaliation.

138
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,458
Superhuman arms race, Armageddon.

139
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,918
End of the world, inevitable.

140
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,882
Is the future immutable?

141
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,925
Can destiny be changed?

142
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,552
Will they allow it?

143
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,181
Screening your calls?

144
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,224
You haven't answered the phone for days.

145
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,188
Oh. It's rank in here.

146
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,024
- Is that you? - Have to try.

147
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:28,817
Alternative unthinkable.

148
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,486
Q?

149
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:33,072
- Are you alright? - Have to go.

150
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,115
Can't let it happen again.

151
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,916
<i>There are at least six different ways</i>

152
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,626
<i>I could stop you right now.</i>

153
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,504
<i>But, they all involve deadly force, don't they?</i>

154
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,589
And you don't do that.

155
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,382
No. You need me.

156
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,718
You wouldn't be much of a hero without a villain

157
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,179
and you do love being the hero, don't you?

158
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:59,973
<i>The cheering children, the swooning women?</i>

159
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,600
<i>You love it so much</i>

160
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,269
<i>it's made you my most reliable accomplice!</i>

161
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,021
<i>Accomplice? What are you...</i>

162
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,357
You could have crushed me any time you wanted.

163
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,609
And it wasn't the law or the will of the people

164
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,860
that stopped you.

165
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,445
It was your ego.

166
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,906
Being a hero was too important to you.

167
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,367
<i>You're as much responsible for this as I am.</i>

168
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:21,703
<i>So go ahead, fix it somehow, put me on trial</i>

169
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,705
<i>lock me up, but I'll beat it.</i>

170
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,999
And then we'll start the whole thing

171
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,918
all over again.

172
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,920
I did loving being a hero.

173
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,257
But if this is where it leads, I'm done with it.

174
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,466
Oh, my.

175
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,398
Just a few more minutes, Superman.

176
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,733
It's okay, I can do this all day.

177
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,402
Not that I want to.

178
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,574
Something I can help you with?

179
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,618
I hope so, but I assume you don't want to discuss

180
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,663
your White House Weenie Roast in front of a crowd.

181
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,627
I'll be back in a few minutes.

182
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,469
Always wondered what was in here.

183
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,555
Private conference room.

184
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:24,474
Original members only, yes?

185
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,270
A place where you're free to discuss your secrets and lies.

186
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,397
You said something about me in the White House.

187
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:35,152
Not you exactly. Another version of you, hmm?

188
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,863
Stop dancing around it. Tell me what you know.

189
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,157
I know what you <i>told</i> everyone.

190
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,118
The Justice Lords a parallel universe version

191
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,494
of the Justice League

192
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,496
came to our world to rid it of crime

193
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,498
just as they did on their own world.

194
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,501
<i>With Lex Luthor's help, our Justice League</i>

195
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,587
<i>managed to rout them before they could impose</i>

196
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,381
<i>their totalitarian will on our populace.</i>

197
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,926
I also know what you didn't tell

198
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,595
anyone outside of the original seven members

199
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,888
of the Justice League.

200
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:04,431
On that other Earth

201
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,683
so very much like our own

202
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:12,022
a Superman, so very much like you killed the President.

203
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,735
Question, no one can know about this.

204
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,153
Or what?

205
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,489
You'll incinerate me, too?

206
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,157
I'd never do anything like that.

207
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,700
Wouldn't you?

208
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,036
Didn't you recently try to lobotomize Doomsday

209
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,248
with your heat vision just as the Justice Lord did?

210
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:32,167
- That's different. - It's the same.

211
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,877
A heavily armed watchtower

212
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,004
with an army of proactive heroes.

213
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,631
Luthor running for President.

214
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,385
If it's not quite the same, it soon will be.

215
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:45,097
Have you seen Amanda Waller's computer simulations?

216
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:46,640
Batman told me about them.

217
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,350
Did he tell you all the models predict

218
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,143
that a war between the Justice League

219
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,229
and the government will devastate the planet?

220
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:53,855
We would never fight the government.

221
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,608
Not even if Luthor was the government?

222
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,946
Predestined.

223
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:04,199
Flash will die, you will kill Luthor.

224
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,202
Armageddon, inevitable.

225
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,579
Question, I'm...

226
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,833
I'm worried about you.

227
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,459
You're mixed up.

228
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,336
This world isn't like the other one.

229
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,380
We're not the Justice Lords.

230
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:21,633
Those things you're afraid of will never happen here.

231
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,302
I won't let them.

232
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,653
Question, isn't it?

233
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,364
I believe you took something that belongs to me.

234
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,907
Have you seen the latest polls?

235
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,284
It's beginning to look like

236
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,161
you're going to be our next President.

237
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,079
Just like in that other world.

238
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,166
I wouldn't bet against me.

239
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:56,168
No. It wouldn't be prudent.

240
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:59,087
I want you to understand something, Luthor.

241
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,298
Although my distaste for you as a human being

242
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,760
is Brobdingnagian, what I'm about to do isn't personal.

243
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,928
What are you babbling about?

244
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,557
Everything that exists has a specific nature.

245
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,560
Each entity exists as something in particular

246
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,980
and has characteristics that are a part of what it is.

247
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:22,361
"A" is "A," and no matter what reality he calls home

248
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,364
Luthor is Luthor.

249
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,866
If I'm to save the world

250
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,951
your existence must come to an end

251
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,746
before you take office.

252
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:36,291
You're going to kill me so that Superman can't.

253
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,543
I'm a well-known crackpot.

254
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,422
The Justice League's reputation will survive my actions.

255
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,300
And Superman's legacy will remain intact.

256
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,803
Interesting plan.

257
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:51,556
Unfortunately for you, it's not really an option.

258
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,274
<i>President? Foolish, faceless man.</i>

259
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,443
My campaign is a farce.

260
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,238
A small part of a much grander scheme.

261
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:08,739
President.

262
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,662
Do you know how much power

263
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,206
I'd have to give up to be President?

264
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,838
That's right, conspiracy buff.

265
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:25,715
I spent $75 million

266
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,301
on a fake presidential campaign

267
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,887
all just to tick Superman off.

268
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,147
Now, about those files you stole from me.

269
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,264
This doesn't have to continue.

270
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,975
I can stop you from seeing the visions at any time.

271
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,274
You stole files from our computer.

272
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,067
Just tell me what you've learned.

273
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,030
Topically applied fluoride doesn't prevent tooth decay.

274
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:33,074
It does render teeth detectable by Spy Satellite.

275
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,871
Tell me what you know.

276
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:42,834
The plastic tips at the ends of shoelaces

277
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,586
are called aglets.

278
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,630
Their true purpose is sinister.

279
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,427
Tell me what you know.

280
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,846
There was a magic bullet.

281
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,057
It was forged by Illuminati mystics

282
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,684
to prevent us from learning the truth!

283
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,436
Have it your way.

284
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,189
This will continue until I break you.

285
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,857
Perhaps, even afterwards.

286
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:16,742
Jimmy.

287
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,626
Jimmy?

288
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,336
<i>Not exactly.</i>

289
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,758
Some kind of hypersonic signal, right?

290
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,553
Keeps good time, too.

291
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,054
What do you think you're doing?

292
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,472
Your little pal is fine.

293
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,683
I was just trying to get your attention.

294
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,560
You guys need a hotline.

295
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,354
A minute, Jimmy.

296
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,606
This better be good.

297
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,401
Question's been missing for almost a week.

298
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,987
Just before he disappeared, he was behaving oddly.

299
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:54,864
I mean, oddly for him.

300
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,866
He saw a fake tape of you killing Luthor

301
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,827
freaked out, and ran off.

302
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,205
Question, this is Superman.

303
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,291
Come in, please.

304
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,501
Channel's open, but he's not responding.

305
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,545
J'onn should be able to track his location.

306
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:15,969
Oh, no.

307
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,892
- I'll find you, baby. - Not here you won't.

308
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,704
They wouldn't have bothered to dump his comlink

309
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,854
unless they took him alive.

310
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:27,939
It has to be Cadmus, but if they've got him

311
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,649
we'll never find him.

312
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,902
Sure we will. We've been keeping tabs on Cadmus for months.

313
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,613
We know exactly where they are.

314
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,156
And you didn't do anything?

315
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:38,658
The Justice League plays by the rules.

316
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,494
We'll move when we have solid evidence, not before.

317
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,040
And we'll move within the limits of the law.

318
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,167
That's why I quit.

319
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,462
The way I remember it, you were fired.

320
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,547
But you may have a point this time.

321
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,882
So?

322
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,509
So, you and I will do this together.

323
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,511
And we're doing it off the books.

324
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,152
We're past the lead shielding.

325
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,529
I should be able to find Question with my X-ray vision.

326
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,323
Hold on.

327
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:22,202
Didn't want you to get hit by a ricochet.

328
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,468
Hold the fort.

329
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,387
I've got some personal business.

330
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,891
Hey, take your time.

331
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,524
A lot of things

332
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,612
are starting make sense now, Professor Hamilton.

333
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,528
When did Cadmus recruit you?

334
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:57,904
Recruit me?

335
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,656
I went to them.

336
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,700
How can you work for these people?

337
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,201
Do you know what they are?

338
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,829
Powerbrokers, politicians, criminals

339
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:09,290
and black ops mercenaries with one thing in common.

340
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,503
Besides they're humanity's last hope against your kind.

341
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,380
What are you talking about?

342
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,674
Humanity doesn't need protection from us.

343
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,884
I used to believe that.

344
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,011
I thought you were a guardian angel

345
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,431
come to answer our prayers.

346
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,642
But Lucifer was an angel, too, wasn't he?

347
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,644
- Professor. - You forget.

348
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,021
I've been on the receiving end of your wrath

349
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,898
when you brought Supergirl to S.T.A.R Labs

350
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,275
for medical treatment.

351
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,652
I know what you're capable of.

352
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,362
That's what this is about?

353
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,698
One little scare, and you betray us?

354
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:46,286
You stole Kara's DNA, violated her trust, my trust!

355
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,955
The chicken or the egg, Superman?

356
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,345
Next time, go to the bathroom

357
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,347
before you leave for a mission.

358
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,807
Let's go.

359
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,149
Don't be stupid. Drop it.

360
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,324
Sorry. Not good enough.

361
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,206
Huntress!

362
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,044
Yeah. Okay.

363
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,506
Lean on me.

364
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,672
We're getting out of here.

365
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,176
Secret messages

366
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:47,055
encoded in amino acid chains in carb-free breakfast bars.

367
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,057
Come on, baby doll.

368
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:50,266
It's alright.

369
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,684
It's gonna be a little rough.

370
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,704
I'll take the guards, you get ready to move him.

371
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:57,232
That won't be necessary, Superman.

372
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,317
Good to see you, captain. Cover our flank.

373
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,277
I'm afraid you misunderstand.

374
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,030
I'm speaking as an officer of the United States Air Force.

375
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,491
Bad time to grow a sense of humor, cap.

376
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:07,951
No joke, ma'am.

377
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,799
I'm currently assigned to General Eiling's

378
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,412
special projects unit, and my orders

379
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,057
are to prevent you from taking Question

380
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,749
out of this facility.

381
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,459
So, how's this gonna go down?
