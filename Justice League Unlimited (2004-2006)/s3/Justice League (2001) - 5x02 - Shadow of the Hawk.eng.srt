1
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,868
We will not be stopped!

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,163
Your partners are going down, Dreamslayer, and so are you.

3
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,921
Mari!

4
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,720
- You okay? - Just need to catch my breath.

5
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,889
Save a piece of him for me.

6
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,142
You think you can stop me with a bubble?

7
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,987
It's a really good bubble.

8
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,530
Where's Shayera?

9
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,153
Why do they always think it's going to be so easy?

10
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,031
Because they always underestimate you.

11
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,247
Get back behind the police line.

12
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,749
I can't do that, Shayera.

13
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,835
I've been hoping to talk to you for a very long time.

14
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,504
- And you are? - Carter Hall.

15
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,423
I wanna show you something.

16
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,681
Easy. It's an artifact, not a weapon.

17
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,808
Well, actually, it's both.

18
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,481
Thanagarian.

19
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,449
All the Thanagarian tech that was left behind

20
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,735
after the war was either confiscated or destroyed.

21
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,445
Most, not all.

22
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,614
Thanagarian contraband sells for big bucks

23
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,199
on the black market.

24
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,746
- Where did you get this? - In Egypt.

25
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:46,999
During an archaeological dig. It's not from the invasion.

26
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,919
<i>It's been on Earth for over 8,000 years.</i>

27
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,504
You're Thanagarian.

28
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,631
With your help, I could translate the glyphs.

29
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,925
Figure out how the technology got there.

30
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,968
We could investigate this together.

31
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,345
Come with me to Egypt.

32
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:01,514
Cairo's beautiful this time of year.

33
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:04,016
I can recommend some nice restaurants.

34
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,102
We'll examine the artifact and get back to you

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,230
when we know something. Thank you, Mr. Hall.

36
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,198
The Metro Tower has some of the most advanced

37
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,859
scientific equipment on the planet.

38
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,445
Okay, while they run their tests, maybe you and I

39
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,365
can discuss this in more detail... over dinner.

40
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,659
Oh, I don't, um...

41
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,999
<i>Okay. Sure.</i>

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,675
I'll see you soon.

43
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,372
<i>- Is that right? - Let me run it again.</i>

44
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,708
Carbon-14 dating confirms that this artifact

45
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,502
is over 8000 years old.

46
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,588
I'm no historian, but that date roughly tracks

47
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,256
with the era of the weapon's design.

48
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,927
And the relative crudity of its Nth metal components.

49
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,595
I've gotta go.

50
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,776
Shayera, I wanted to... Judas Priest!

51
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,656
- Problem? - No, no.

52
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:27,701
It's just, uh, I've never seen you in a dress before.

53
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,748
- You don't like it? - It's, uh, fetching.

54
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,126
If you want one for Vixen, I can tell you where I got it.

55
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,630
Ahem, listen...

56
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:44,134
Glad I caught you before you did something stupid.

57
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,303
- Excuse me? - Carter Hall.

58
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,848
- What about him? - I did some research.

59
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:51,016
His birth name is Joseph Gardner.

60
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,810
- He lied? - No.

61
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:55,563
Six months ago, he had it legally changed to Carter Hall.

62
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,231
He's an archaeologist.

63
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,734
<i>Currently curator of The Midway City Museum.</i>

64
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,612
Had an excellent reputation until about five years ago

65
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,615
when he started claiming that aliens landed in ancient Egypt.

66
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,243
Aliens? Well, then, he must be a lunatic.

67
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:11,912
Because we all know that there's no life on other planets.

68
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,664
- There's more. - What?

69
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,542
Our Mr. Hall spends quite a bit of time on the internet.

70
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,168
Dang, lock him up.

71
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,629
He frequents the I-hate-Hawkgirl bulletin boards.

72
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,132
That doesn't mean... Boards?

73
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,677
- How many are there? - Fifty seven web rings.

74
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,321
Unaffiliated sites number in the hundreds...

75
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,763
Forget I asked.

76
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,557
Hall keeps getting banned from them.

77
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,726
For flaming the anti-Shayera posters.

78
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,312
- So he's a fan. - He's a stalker.

79
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,035
<i>There.</i>

80
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,828
So he was in the crowd.

81
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,872
- I don't see what... - Wait.

82
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,011
A coincidence. This-this doesn't mean he's...

83
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,648
I'm gonna have a little talk with this guy.

84
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,609
This isn't any of your business or yours.

85
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,195
- It's League business. - Oh, really?

86
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,030
<i>Do I tell you who to date?</i>

87
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,616
Carter Hall has uncovered a genuine mystery.

88
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,451
And I think it's worth investigating.

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,078
You should take backup.

90
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,706
I meant Batman. I...

91
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,750
We don't want you walking into a trap.

92
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:44,088
I can take care of myself. Thanks.

93
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,339
The point is...

94
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:48,467
The point is you don't trust me.

95
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,094
Either of you.

96
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:53,889
Don't wait up.

97
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,394
This isn't right.

98
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,312
- I know, but don't... - No.

99
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,232
I mean, this shouldn't be happening.

100
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
When we traveled to the future

101
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,569
we met my son, mine and Shayera's.

102
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,739
We're supposed to be together. It's our destiny.

103
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,159
If you really believe that, why are you still with Vixen?

104
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,716
- What? - I miss the dress.

105
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,051
You didn't miss it last night.

106
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,980
Anyway, it didn't seem like the right outfit

107
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,097
for an archaeological dig.

108
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:38,308
You're right. The pants are fine.

109
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,437
You'd look beautiful in anything.

110
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,023
It's your dig, Romeo. Lead the way.

111
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,038
Shayera, don't!

112
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,050
Poison. They're mercury-tipped.

113
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,384
Nasty.

114
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,846
The entire tomb is booby-trapped.

115
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,557
It took me months to learn how to avoid them all.

116
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,810
Right. After you, then.

117
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,313
The trick is the raised glyphs.

118
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,875
<i>If you press them in the proper sequence</i>

119
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,419
<i>they disarm the defenses down here.</i>

120
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,195
<i>And if you get it wrong?</i>

121
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,614
<i>Well, we're already in a tomb, so that's handy.</i>

122
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,415
I've made a lot of progress deciphering

123
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:52,234
some of these glyphs, but this one, for instance...

124
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,444
<i>Journey, I think.</i>

125
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,823
And the mark on the side means Conclusion.

126
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,783
The end of a long journey?

127
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,785
I have a confession to make.

128
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,705
I haven't been completely honest with you.

129
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,748
<i>I brought you here under false pretenses.</i>

130
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,128
Or should I say... destiny brought you.

131
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,713
What do you think you're...

132
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,883
You and I are the reincarnation of lovers who died here.

133
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:18,343
<i>Thousands of years ago.</i>

134
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,512
<i>My real name is Katar Hol.</i>

135
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,186
But you can call me Hawkman.

136
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,117
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,328
I'm not laughing at you... exactly.

138
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,414
I just, I've got the worst taste in men.

139
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,542
- I'm serious, Shayera. - I know you are.

140
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,754
<i>And I'm in a lost Egyptian tomb with my stalker.</i>

141
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:56,131
<i>The worst part is, I'm going to have to listen to John</i>

142
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,383
<i>and Batman saying, "I told you so."</i>

143
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,802
<i>I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out.</i>

144
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,679
<i>Our souls have been bound together</i>

145
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,681
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

146
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,766
This device, it's called an Absorbacron.

147
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,354
<i>I unearthed it three years ago.</i>

148
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,817
<i>And when I touched it...</i>

149
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>After I woke up, I understood everything.</i>

150
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:12,249
<i>Almost everything.</i>

151
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,418
<i>The machine restored the memory of my life here</i>

152
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,378
<i>thousands of years ago.</i>

153
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,884
<i>In 6600 BC, two Thanagarian law hawks were sucked</i>

154
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,263
<i>through a worm hole into an uncharted sector of space.</i>

155
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:29,266
<i>They landed here when their ship ran out of fuel.</i>

156
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:42,779
<i>They were stranded with no way to get home.</i>

157
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,532
<i>They decided to use their technology to improve the lives</i>

158
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,119
<i>of the locals, and they succeeded...</i>

159
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,288
<i>beyond their wildest dreams.</i>

160
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,501
<i>They turned this arid waste into a paradise.</i>

161
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,338
<i>We ruled this land with fairness and compassion</i>

162
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>and the people loved us.</i>

163
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,258
<i>But there were factions that resented</i>

164
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,844
<i>these two Gods from another world.</i>

165
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,764
A jealous priest poisoned us.

166
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,933
Poisoned you and me. Do you understand now?

167
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,685
We died, Shayera.

168
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,104
The extraordinary society we created fell

169
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,442
in less than a generation, its technological secrets lost...

170
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,903
until I rediscovered them.

171
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,838
Look, an Absorbacron is just a database

172
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,132
that you interface with telepathically.

173
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,843
What you saw was probably just the ship's log.

174
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,137
It's old, probably damaged.

175
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,807
It filled your mind with thoughts, feelings

176
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,017
memories that weren't your own.

177
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,353
We're not reincarnated lovers.

178
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,146
Come with me.

179
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,940
Once you touch it, you'll understand.

180
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,148
Hands off.

181
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,191
Hah!

182
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,571
Shayera, please.

183
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,908
<i>Let the Absorbacron speak to you as it's spoken to me and...</i>

184
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,843
Rise and shine, my delusional friend.

185
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:11,052
Who are you?

186
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,846
He calls himself the Shadow Thief.

187
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:14,264
He's a talker.

188
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,100
Unfortunately, she isn't.

189
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,186
At least not so far.

190
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:20,562
Stop!

191
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,272
What do you want from her?

192
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,481
Nothing.

193
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,192
That was just for fun.

194
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,611
I've been following you for weeks.

195
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,863
Waiting to be led to this treasure trove.

196
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,491
These Thanagarian artifacts will go for millions

197
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,870
on the black market. And I do so like money.

198
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,582
But I need your archaeological expertise in order to disarm

199
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,961
the tomb's final line of defense and enter the burial chamber

200
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,381
where, of course, the most valuable pieces lie.

201
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,091
Not going to happen.

202
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,468
Really?

203
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,346
I think we've got room to negotiate.

204
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:01,186
I understand that Thanagarians are stronger than humans.

205
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:06,441
<i>I wonder how long will you last under my tender care.</i>

206
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,902
Knock yourself out, jerkhole.

207
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,404
A little rude, darling, don't you think?

208
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:14,866
Stop! I'll help you!

209
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,326
Carter, no!

210
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,603
<i>You again.</i>

211
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,064
I've never been afraid of shadows.

212
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,109
Now is an excellent time to start.

213
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,791
This chamber's unstable. If we don't end this fast...

214
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,253
The whole tunnel could come down on us.

215
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,019
I'll take one of those.

216
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:07,520
And one of those.

217
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,647
Hah!

218
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,860
Haven't you figured it out yet, darling?

219
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,988
I'm only solid when I want to be.

220
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,907
Who said I want you solid?

221
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,080
Filthy witch!

222
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,621
The Absorbacron!

223
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,338
Carter, it doesn't matter. It...

224
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,716
No! I've got to save it!

225
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:39,988
- It's lost forever. - It nearly killed you.

226
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,073
That machine was designed to telepathically

227
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,075
communicate with Thanagarians.

228
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,203
It was too powerful for an unshielded human mind.

229
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,164
J'onn J'onzz is a telepath.

230
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:51,392
Perhaps he can help you sort through the information...

231
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,376
I don't need any help.

232
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,628
I know the truth.

233
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,591
We're the reincarnations of Katar and Shayera Hol.

234
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,967
And I love you.

235
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,636
Oh, you can't love me, Carter.

236
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,306
You don't even know me.

237
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:07,640
Your favorite color is teal.

238
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,409
You could eat Croatians oysters everyday

239
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,144
even though they give you heartburn.

240
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,354
<i>You get up early because you love the sunrise</i>

241
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,191
<i>and nothing's more important to you than fighting for those</i>

242
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,152
<i>who can't fight for themselves.</i>

243
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,281
You'll see the truth... eventually.

244
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,408
- It's destiny. - It's not.

245
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,327
It's just the Absorbacron.

246
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:30,872
I've waited thousands of years for us to find each other.

247
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,916
I can wait a little longer.

248
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:46,137
- How stupid do you think I am? - Scale of one to ten?

249
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,389
Funny. I meant this.

250
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,228
Hall was the one I didn't trust.

251
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:56,147
Right, that's why you planted this bug.

252
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,816
How much did you hear?

253
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:01,277
A bunch of nonsense about reincarnation and destiny.

254
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,738
Maybe it isn't nonsense.

255
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,657
If you really believe that.
