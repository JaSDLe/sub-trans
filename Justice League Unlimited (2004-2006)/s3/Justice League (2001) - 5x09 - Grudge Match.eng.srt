1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,022
- Ha ha. - Come on!

2
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,863
- Disaster. - You don't know the half of it.

3
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,866
We'll be lucky if we can make the rent on this toilet.

4
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:39,330
- That's it? - Nobody's betting.

5
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,588
<i>Who can blame them?</i>

6
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:03,229
It's no good. There isn't enough.

7
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,899
The last remnant of Brainiac but there isn't enough to work with.

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,903
Perhaps if you constructed a positronic event chamber.

9
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:15,533
Yes, yes, that could work, but where would I get the money?

10
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,341
Between the government freezing my assets

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,704
and the cost of running this secret society...

12
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:22,748
He's talking to his imaginary friend again.

13
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,418
You're a resourceful human, Luthor.

14
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,086
I'm sure you'll find a way.

15
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,464
What do you want, Sonar?

16
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,425
You busy? Roulette wants to...

17
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,678
I'm more than capable of speaking for myself.

18
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:40,224
Lex, darling, I'm having some serious financial problems

19
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,268
and I'm afraid you're to blame.

20
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:45,104
Well, don't look at me to bail you out, Roulette.

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,273
I'm the one who skims you.

22
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,567
You know I don't like to complain, Lex

23
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,737
but you are taking a much bigger cut of the gross

24
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:56,866
than Grodd ever did and Meta-Brawl receipts are down.

25
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,868
I've seen the books.

26
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:02,413
Now, don't think me ungrateful but you've been poaching

27
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,626
the best fighters for your so-called secret society.

28
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:10,087
Pity. Cut to the chase, Roulette. What do you want?

29
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,883
If I could only have a few star attractions in the ring...

30
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,844
Bizarro, Sinestro...

31
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,388
Maybe Bizarro versus Sinestro.

32
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:25,019
Back off, hot pants. Give the man some space.

33
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,063
You're playing with fire, witch.

34
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,398
- Who's playing? - Tala!

35
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,275
Come on, let 'em go at it a minute.

36
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,319
There's not going to be any fighting.

37
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,491
At least not here.

38
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,452
Sonar, I think you've given me the solution

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,331
to Roulette's problem and mine as well.

40
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,336
Of course, the new Meta-Brawl. All-girl fights all the time!

41
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:54,715
We'll call it The Glamour Slam or The Belles Of The Brawl.

42
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,218
Chickapalooza!

43
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,600
With the right backing, it's a million-dollar idea. A cash cow!

44
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,936
But even this won't work if the girls are all

45
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,938
second-string villains.

46
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,941
Who said anything about villains?

47
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,558
<i>Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.</i>

48
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,492
- Need a hand, Canary? - Not from you.

49
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,286
Suit yourself.

50
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,500
I've never seen you so sloppy. What's the deal?

51
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,002
Get out of my way.

52
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,799
I don't need your help, Huntress.

53
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,218
Right, you were doing a fabulous job

54
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,386
of getting your butt handed to you.

55
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,555
What did he do, anyway?

56
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,599
- Stole a wallet. - Shut up!

57
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
You got creamed by a pickpocket?

58
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,147
- You sure you're okay? - Worried?

59
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,650
- Curious. - Right.

60
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,695
I didn't think you cared about anyone.

61
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:45,135
I'm telling you, Q, Canary's totally off her game.

62
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,470
I think she's moonlighting?

63
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,722
Maybe she's stepping out on Green Arrow.

64
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,101
The deeper mystery here is why do you even care.

65
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:54,229
Isn't this the woman who beat the snot out of you

66
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,395
a few months back?

67
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,606
She got a lucky shot in.

68
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,110
<i>Okay, five or six lucky shots.</i>

69
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,546
<i>Anyway, that's not the point...</i>

70
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,948
Aha! As I suspected.

71
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,117
<i>Thirty two flavors.</i>

72
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,161
<i>There's something wrong here, Q. I can feel it.</i>

73
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,999
I'm the conspiracy theorist and even I don't see anything.

74
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,378
So what are you wearing?

75
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,213
<i>Blue overcoat, fedora.</i>

76
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,174
You really stink at this.

77
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,843
<i>Orange socks.</i>

78
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,864
Piece of...

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,826
cake.

80
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,457
Going down?

81
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,902
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

82
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,989
Welcome to another ultra-exclusive evening

83
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:13,242
of Meta-Brawl Glamour Slam.

84
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,079
My name is Roulette, and I make the rules.

85
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,845
Prepare to see the biggest, baddest, super-powered struggle

86
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:36,682
for dominance that it has ever been my pleasure to present.

87
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,686
<i>A no-holds-barred fight between two legendary ladies</i>

88
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:46,275
of the League, Fire, the blistering babe from Brazil

89
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:49,278
<i>and the sultry siren of the Sonic Smackdown</i>

90
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:54,908
the undefeated queen of the Glamour Slam, Black Canary.

91
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:04,084
<i>Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

92
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>Let the pain begin.</i>

93
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,359
Ha-ah!

94
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,820
<i>And the winner is...</i>

95
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,836
Jeez, what's wrong with you? You almost killed Fire back there.

96
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,630
Are you undercover? ls Roulette blackmailing you?

97
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,215
Talk to me.

98
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,388
You've got worse than that coming.

99
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,380
You better call the League in on...

100
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,470
Terrific.

101
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,764
What's-what's going...

102
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,229
Thanks for saving us the trouble.

103
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,441
We really appreciate it.

104
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,570
How was I supposed to know you snapped out of it?

105
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:39,156
I mean, I couldn't be sure.

106
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,118
They've had you up every night working the arena.

107
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,246
No wonder you've been fighting like a girl.

108
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,455
You know what I mean.

109
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,218
You don't remember, do you?

110
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,426
You did that to her.

111
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,720
No way.

112
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,680
Where do you think you got that burn?

113
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,265
It wasn't your fault.

114
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,976
They must be using some kind of mind control technology.

115
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,185
Grodd's.

116
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,479
Wherever it comes from

117
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,940
that stuff's a little too efficient for my taste.

118
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,668
Your earpiece was wrecked in the fight.

119
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,902
We can't phone for help.

120
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,279
Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.

121
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,656
The League comlinks.

122
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,664
That must be how Roulette was controlling you.

123
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,082
If she dies, Roulette, I'm taking you down

124
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,000
hard, I promise you that.

125
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,462
Now why would I let such a valuable commodity die?

126
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,674
On the other hand, you two aren't under my control

127
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,551
which means I'm going to have to eliminate you.

128
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,387
In the ring, of course.

129
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:47,057
Why just snuff you when I can sell tickets and lay odds?

130
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,934
You're scum.

131
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,728
No, no, my dear. I'm an entrepreneur.

132
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,315
Let's face it, with some A-list heroes to do the jobs

133
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,402
your deaths will net me millions.

134
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,790
An extra-added attraction tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

135
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:18,297
<i>Black Canary had so much fun, she's come back for more.</i>

136
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,552
<i>And she's brought the Huntress with her.</i>

137
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:33,770
<i>But they won't be fighting each other.</i>

138
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,068
<i>They'll be fighting together.</i>

139
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:45,449
<i>Huntress and Black Canary versus two new contenders.</i>

140
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:48,493
<i>Vixen, the beauty with the beast powers</i>

141
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,789
<i>and the Thanagar thrasher, Hawkgirl.</i>

142
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,134
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.

143
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,053
Looks like we're in this together.

144
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,679
If you call me girlfriend

145
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,015
I'm gonna dropkick you into the next county.

146
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,809
Now, don't go all sentimental on me.

147
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,807
No, no, no, little bird.

148
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,268
Watchtower...

149
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,021
What?

150
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,607
Let me give you the short version.

151
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,945
Huh!

152
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:06,488
I don't wanna hurt you, Shayera.

153
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:08,740
But I wanna hurt you.

154
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,913
Just when we were starting to get along.

155
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,688
Huh?

156
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,858
I don't think I wanna know.

157
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,318
We're all in a cage match fighting to the death.

158
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,654
Yeah, see?

159
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:52,033
Is that all you got?

160
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,077
Oh, no.

161
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,456
<i>I've saved the very best for last.</i>

162
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:14,264
<i>Yes, that's really Wonder Woman, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

163
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,433
<i>It is on!</i>

164
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,894
<i>Can even these four beautiful bruisers</i>

165
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:22,355
<i>stand up to the Amazon powerhouse herself?</i>

166
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,275
- Anybody got a plan? - Yeah, try to stay alive.

167
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,985
Anybody got a good plan?

168
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,104
We're getting creamed here.

169
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,947
Let me try. Cover you ears.

170
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,709
Keep her busy so I can take her from behind.

171
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,377
Oh, nice move.

172
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,837
That's all I got.

173
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:07,729
Control center's gotta be up there.

174
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,522
Hang on.

175
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,534
I should have taken you down last time. My mistake.

176
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,713
I know your kind, Roulette. You like to watch.

177
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,242
<i>But when it comes to getting your own pretty hands dirty...</i>

178
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,512
Didn't think I was that good, did you?

179
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,353
Breaking news, I'm even better.

180
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,169
- Who's better? - You.

181
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,922
- You! - You got that right.

182
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,842
In another 30 seconds, your brains will be so scrambled

183
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,969
I'll be able to serve 'em up with bacon.

184
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,184
Okay, I give up.

185
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,400
Do I kill the signal or you?

186
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,640
I hope you two have an explanation for this.

187
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,607
Slow steps. That's it.

188
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:18,443
- I did what? - I know how you feel.

189
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:20,463
You know, if you want, I can talk to the League

190
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,780
and get you back in.

191
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:24,115
Nah, I do fine on my own.

192
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:28,745
Thank you, Helena. If you hadn't...

193
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,164
You would have done the same.

194
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,892
You know, I was totally whipping your butt

195
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,083
back when they caught us.

196
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,919
Pfft! In your dreams.

197
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,505
Like I'd waste my dreams on you.

198
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,298
We could settle this right now.

199
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,260
After all the mindless brutality we've seen tonight, no, thanks.

200
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,388
Yeah, I hear you, bad enough most people think

201
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,016
superheroes solve all their problems with their fists.

202
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,102
Like we're all a bunch of muscle-headed stereotypes.

203
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,355
- We're better than that. - Way.

204
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:01,027
- Two falls out of three? - You're on.
