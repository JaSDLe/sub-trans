1
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,776
What?

2
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,237
I know. I'm going as fast as I can.

3
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,609
Luthor, don't make any sudden moves.

4
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,194
It's over.

5
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,499
Hold fire! Hold fire!

6
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,979
Here we are, Mr. Luthor.

7
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,857
Your benefactor is looking forward to meeting you.

8
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,109
Does the mystery man have a name?

9
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:55,406
No reason to be insulting, Lex. I'm far superior to any man.

10
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:02,204
Grodd, I appreciate the help but gratitude only goes so far.

11
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm not interested in working with you or anyone else.

12
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:08,169
I think you'll change your mind...

13
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,838
once you've seen what I have to offer.

14
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,176
Why would you even try to move a prisoner

15
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,470
that dangerous without calling us?

16
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,949
Maybe because we thought we could do our jobs without help

17
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,213
from the mighty Justice League.

18
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,685
And yet, here we are.

19
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,771
Okay, Shayera, what's done is done.

20
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,565
Let's see if we can pick up his trail.

21
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,066
Aztec?

22
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,829
The wall's sub-molecular integrity has been compromised.

23
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,457
Leptons showing residual weak force interactions?

24
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,292
Yeah. How did you know?

25
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,128
It's a common energy signature of matter phasing technology.

26
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,755
I assume it doesn't leave a trail?

27
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:18,048
No such luck. Maybe Aztec could...

28
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,550
You guys want some coffee?

29
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,802
Apparently I got nothing better to do here.

30
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,471
Sorry, we got caught up in the work.

31
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,390
Special agent, King Faraday, I'm the new liaison

32
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,994
between the attorney general's office and the Justice League.

33
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,395
- Good to meet you. I'm... - Aztec.

34
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,397
I've been well-briefed on all of you.

35
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,025
Security on Luthor's transfer was lax

36
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,568
because it didn't seem necessary.

37
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,945
We haven't had a peep out of him since he was arrested

38
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,114
for that Brainiac business last summer.

39
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,826
He's a broken man. Just sits in his cell talking to himself.

40
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,370
When he's not stealing police vans, you mean.

41
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,997
That came out of nowhere.

42
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,249
We had no reason to think he was an active threat.

43
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,001
Do what you can. Put out an APB.

44
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,086
Stake out airports, train, and bus stations.

45
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,631
Already done for what it's worth.

46
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,800
If he's sighted, don't approach him.

47
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,427
- Call in the League. - My people can handle this.

48
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,681
No, they can't. Your people are good, Luthor is better.

49
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,185
And if you get a lead on him, I expect to be kept in the loop.

50
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:12,686
Of course.

51
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,272
What is this?

52
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,234
A home away from home for members of my...

53
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,985
organization.

54
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,963
I'll admit we're putting on something of a show

55
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,489
for your benefit.

56
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,450
We rarely have so many members here at once.

57
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,455
Yes, it would take a huge scam to pay for all these people.

58
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,417
Actually, it's the other way around.

59
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,336
They pay me.

60
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,381
The world's most powerful supervillains

61
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,300
<i>banded together with one common goal.</i>

62
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,053
They protect each other from the Justice League.

63
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,515
It's the only way to survive in the modern world.

64
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:53,018
There are so many heroes now and under the Martian

65
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,437
they're too organized for freethinkers like ourselves

66
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,940
to make a dishonest buck.

67
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:00,067
You're running a protection racket.

68
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,652
A co-op.

69
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,821
Everyone's free to go about their own business

70
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,408
but if, say, Batman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash

71
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,660
show up to foil your bank robbery...

72
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,246
you no longer have to face them alone.

73
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,874
Right.

74
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,876
He does it out of the goodness of his heart.

75
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:22,548
Plus 25 percent of the gross. So far, it's working perfectly.

76
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:25,175
The League doesn't even know that we exist.

77
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,512
I have to hand it to you. This is an impressive operation.

78
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,723
But we're still not interested.

79
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,686
See, now, that's a problem.

80
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,271
You're much too powerful a player

81
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,814
to be out there freelance.

82
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't worry about the competition.

83
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,820
- I'm out of the business. - Really?

84
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,239
Then why bother to escape from prison?

85
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,660
Oh, you've still got the spark, Luthor.

86
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,705
I see it in your eyes, the spark of a man

87
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,250
<i>who can't be bound by society's petty restrictions.</i>

88
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:03,213
Besides, nobody who plays the game at our level ever quits.

89
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,717
Oh, you got that right. Completely missing the point.

90
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,888
- Luthor? - You think you understand me.

91
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,557
That you actually have anything to offer?

92
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:18,228
For a brief moment, I attained absolute knowledge, godhood.

93
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,772
Now it's all gone.

94
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,359
You melded with the computer-being, Brainiac

95
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,777
and at your moment of triumph

96
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:28,989
the Justice League destroyed him, tragic.

97
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,451
Now there isn't a single piece of him left anywhere on earth.

98
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,371
<i>Except of course, for this one.</i>

99
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,707
Give it to me.

100
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,877
Salvation comes at a price, Lex.

101
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,088
First you do something for me

102
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,007
then you'll get your precious rock.

103
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,009
<i>Do whatever he asks.</i>

104
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,472
My entire program resides in even the smallest part of me.

105
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,558
I could reconstitute you, bring you back to life.

106
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,853
Yes, we could be together again.

107
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,358
Alright, Grodd. I'm in.

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,493
<i>- Chuck!</i> - What is it, honey?

109
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,912
Your old footlocker's beeping.

110
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,420
At first, I thought it was the smoke detector.

111
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:27,006
<i>That ain't no smoke alarm.</i>

112
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,014
<i>It's a sound I never thought I'd hear again.</i>

113
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,054
There's trouble on Blackhawk Island.

114
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,351
Aztec didn't find anything else?

115
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,187
Sorry, Superman. It was a bad lead.

116
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,605
Nobody's fault.

117
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,858
When you guys do pick up Luthor's trail, call me.

118
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,526
I want in.

119
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:53,782
You know what? This new monitor duty rotation isn't so bad.

120
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,035
No more overnights unless you want them.

121
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,287
Only one shift a week and you're done.

122
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,330
- Wally? - Hmm?

123
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,376
I'm telling you, you shouldn't let it go out.

124
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:07,629
Why don't you just go talk to her?

125
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,133
Who? Me? Talk to her? Ha! No way.

126
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:14,219
Yeah, you'd probably be wasting your time anyway.

127
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,096
I hear she's, you know...

128
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,642
Brazilian.

129
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,478
Ha ha.

130
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:25,439
If you're afraid to talk to her, I'll tell her for you.

131
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:31,987
- Don't! - You are so very sad.

132
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,198
Got something for you.

133
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,159
Tell Hawkgirl your story, Mr. Seriani.

134
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,412
<i>We met a while back, ma'am. Longer for me than for you.</i>

135
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,040
<i>When you traveled in time to World War ll</i>

136
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:44,708
<i>you fought alongside my squadron.</i>

137
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,878
- You're one of the Blackhawks. - Only one still kicking.

138
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,422
- I'm sorry to say. - What's the problem?

139
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,841
During the war and for decades after we captured

140
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,178
a lot of weapons, real sci-fi stuff

141
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,347
we hid the worst of it on Blackhawk Island.

142
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,891
We decommissioned the place over 30 years ago.

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,060
But this morning, the old security alarm went off.

144
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,561
<i>Might be nothing.</i>

145
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,688
Or it might be someone raiding your armory.

146
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,108
We'll take a look. Shayera out.

147
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,277
- Pick a third for the team. - Um...

148
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,990
- Hey, Fire. - Yes?

149
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,159
We've got a mission. Let's go.

150
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,713
I'm not going to argue with you about this.

151
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,300
I didn't come to argue. It gets cold up there.

152
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,404
Allow me.

153
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,497
Something of a specialty of mine.

154
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,382
You haven't said a word the whole trip.

155
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,677
I was hoping this mission would give us

156
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,180
the chance to get to know each other a little better.

157
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,937
I understand. You're very deep in thought.

158
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,730
Mentally preparing for the battle.

159
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,107
No time for women. I understand.

160
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:19,363
Oops. Sorry.

161
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,951
Two bogeys closing fast.

162
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:43,512
I'm losing it. We're going down.

163
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,318
Get ready to bail.

164
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,987
Ejector pods off-line.

165
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,114
We're gonna have to do this the hard way.

166
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,003
I got it.

167
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,050
Ha!

168
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,273
Ha!

169
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,117
Hawk! Aah!

170
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,080
That thing's gonna blow.

171
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,689
You need both hands to help Shayera.

172
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,125
Drop me.

173
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,715
Sure hope I think of something before I hit the ground.

174
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,608
<i>He told you to drop him?</i>

175
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,777
He is the senior member of the team.

176
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,904
You know he can't fly, right?

177
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:25,572
<i>Hey, ladies!</i>

178
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,703
Check me out. I'm just like a helicopter.

179
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,581
Whoa! Ah!

180
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm sort of like a helicopter.

181
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't you ever scare me like that again.

182
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:44,174
She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had.

183
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,426
Only, you know, short.

184
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,680
Wait up!

185
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,645
I know everything there is to know about this island.

186
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,356
- You're going to need my help. - We've got it covered.

187
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,884
And no offense but you're little old for this kind of work.

188
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,444
Something's activated the island's defense grid.

189
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,823
You wanna make it out of here alive, I'm coming with you.

190
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,039
Whoever's on the island will be headed for master control.

191
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,834
That's in a bunker under the Blackhawk Victory Museum.

192
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,710
Where you stored the weapons you captured?

193
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,796
Yeah. There's some serious ordinance there.

194
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:24,673
Even got a couple of old war wheels.

195
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,467
Wasn't all that stuff destroyed in the war?

196
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,916
Don't believe everything you see

197
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,762
on the documentary channel, sweetheart.

198
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,764
War wheels? Robot condors?

199
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,100
You got a pretty goofy security system here.

200
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:38,186
- Yeah. Good times. - I see something.

201
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,277
<i>Somebody ain't impressed with the security.</i>

202
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:58,999
We have to hurry.

203
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:04,880
That should keep them occupied.

204
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,119
Move it or lose it!

205
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,967
You're the human lock pick. Why don't you do this?

206
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,345
- Grodd's not testing me. - Company's coming.

207
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,440
Whoever you guys are, you got no business being in here.

208
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,152
Sorta goes with the territory. We're thieves.

209
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,031
We're going to do this the hard way, Lex? Please say yes.

210
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,701
You're threatening us with a metal weapon?

211
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:00,704
I'm a ferokinetic or hadn't you heard?

212
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,584
Shayera!

213
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,590
You've got problems of your own.

214
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,856
Magnets lose their charge if you heat them.

215
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,276
You can't hurt me with...

216
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,821
What are you doing? I can't...

217
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:44,474
Now, why is it you always find the keys

218
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,809
in the last place you look?

219
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,227
<i>Let them go.</i>

220
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,312
They're pathetic, but they're with me.

221
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,398
I'm sorry. If I were 20 years younger...

222
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:54,234
You'd still be ancient. Keep quiet.

223
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,115
<i>Island self-destruct sequence initiated.</i>

224
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,075
<i>Three minutes to detonation.</i>

225
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:06,746
Chew on that for a while. We're leaving.

226
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,249
If you follow, you know what happens to him.

227
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,929
What did you do?

228
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,437
Don't bother. We got what we came for.

229
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,816
Forget it, there's still time

230
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,443
for me to run us out to the water.

231
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:40,238
No, I'm not going to let all this history be lost.

232
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,950
I can't crack the code, but maybe if I...

233
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,120
You better let me do that.

234
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:50,290
<i>Self-destruct sequence canceled.</i>

235
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,333
Can't fix everything by hitting it.

236
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:58,673
What was in there?

237
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:15,356
The spear of Longinus. Hitler believed that whoever holds it is invincible.

238
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,834
What are you going to do with it?

239
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,058
Sell it to the highest bidder?

240
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,236
Keep it yourself and try to conquer the world?

241
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,823
I was thinking it would look good on the wall in my office.

242
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,576
You mean you recruited me, sent me to an island

243
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,829
full of death traps, end up against The Justice League?

244
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,832
You made me risk my life and all for nothing?

245
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,252
Essentially, yes.

246
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,340
Monkey, I like your style.

247
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,842
Give me the piece of Brainiac and we're even.

248
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,221
Not yet, Lex. Today was just a test.

249
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,848
Your next mission is for real.

250
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,393
He still has something we need.

251
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,063
We have to put up with him for the moment.

252
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,732
I should kill you.

253
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,568
- But you won't. - No.

254
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,780
Not today.

255
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,955
Luthor sure didn't waste any time rounding up a crew.

256
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:15,250
- Who were those guys? - Dr. Polaris and the key?

257
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,086
I don't know. They've never worked with Luthor before.

258
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:20,588
All I know is Superman's going to be pretty ticked

259
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,925
that we let Luthor get away just to keep some musty old museum

260
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,385
from being destroyed.

261
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,647
It was worth it.
