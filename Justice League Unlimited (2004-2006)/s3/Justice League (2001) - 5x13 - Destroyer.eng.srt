1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,590
<i>Previously on "Justice League Unlimited..."</i>

2
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:09,342
<i>You are the mystic conduit</i>

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,969
<i>that draws cosmic essence from the debris.</i>

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,513
<i>I'll be able to reconstitute</i>

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,806
<i>Brainiac from that energy.</i>

6
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,523
Let the universe howl in despair

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,900
for I have returned.

8
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,736
Superman must suffer for killing me.

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,280
<i>His adopted world will die screaming.</i>

10
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,367
We have a little problem.

11
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,100
Let's say, just for the sake of argument

12
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,394
that I believe a single word of your story.

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,146
How did you survive the explosion?

14
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,148
By the skin of my teeth.

15
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:56,741
<i>But stranded more than a power ring's charge from home</i>

16
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,744
<i>we found ourselves dependent on the kindness of strangers.</i>

17
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,708
<i>A resident of the nearby planet</i>

18
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,210
<i>New Genesis, drawn by our ship's explosion</i>

19
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,712
<i>offered his help.</i>

20
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,052
<i>We accepted, of course.</i>

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,013
You've got some nerve coming to us for help.

22
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,891
Darkseid took Brainiac away from me.

23
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,393
I can't hear his voice in my head anymore.

24
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,646
Enough of the crazy talk, Lex.

25
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,315
Darkseid said he was coming to Earth to destroy it.

26
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,651
You guys were supposed to keep that from happening.

27
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,402
We'll do just that, lady.

28
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,862
Thanks for the heads-up.

29
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,530
And what about us?

30
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,240
You're all going into holding cells.

31
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,427
You think so? Ain't no way we're giving up without a...

32
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,911
Watchtower to Metro Tower.

33
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,997
- We've got a situation. - What's going on up there?

34
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,791
Multiple hyper-spatial incursions

35
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,042
but they're planet-side.

36
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,919
<i>I'm sending telemetry.</i>

37
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,962
- Boom tubes. - He's right.

38
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,964
Can you hear it? Like thunder?

39
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,821
<i>Attention, all Justice League personnel</i>

40
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,115
<i>this is an Omega-level threat.</i>

41
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,826
- Get to the Javelins. - No time.

42
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,495
All members, prepare for emergency teleport.

43
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,415
Send us first. Give the others a chance to get their pants on.

44
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:28,623
You got it.

45
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,554
Okay. Let's get these people locked up.

46
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,281
It sounds like we've got a fight on our hands.

47
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,640
If you think you're locking us up

48
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,475
while the whole world's under attack

49
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,644
you got two fights on your hands.

50
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,565
She's got a point.

51
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,613
We'll need all the bodies we can throw at this.

52
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,527
Oh, come on. It's Lex Flippin' Luthor.

53
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,112
Why should we trust him?

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,572
Hey, it's our world, too.

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,657
Let's be clear about this.

56
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,743
We're not here to help you save the world.

57
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,662
You're here to help me get revenge on Darkseid.

58
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,832
When this is over, it's back to business as usual.

59
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,085
Wouldn't have it any other way.

60
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,254
- You get all that? - Yeah.

61
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,257
- You guys sure about this? - Trust, but verify.

62
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,343
Put the bad guys on teams with regular leaders.

63
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,596
Search through the telemetry on the attack groups.

64
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,347
Find the best protected mother ship.

65
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,932
That's where Darkseid will be.

66
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,685
- That's where I wanna go. - I imagine so.

67
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,188
It's in Metropolis hovering over "The Daily Planet."

68
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,396
Stand by.

69
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,110
Back off.

70
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,672
Is there a plan here?

71
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,927
Take out the small fry until we attract

72
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,804
the big fish's attention.

73
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,681
Ah, with everything going on

74
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,516
I'll bet he never notices us.

75
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,395
You're on.

76
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,731
I'll take some of that action.

77
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,406
I hope you appreciate, Kal-El

78
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,909
that everything that happens from this point

79
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,786
is on your head.

80
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,788
<i>The skies will rain fire.</i>

81
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,498
<i>The oceans will boil.</i>

82
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:39,375
<i>The streets will run red</i>

83
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,418
<i>with the blood of billions.</i>

84
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,712
Only then, after your last

85
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,798
pitiful hope is extinguished

86
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,592
will I end your life.

87
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,219
Let's go.

88
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,148
You destroyed Brainiac

89
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,567
and I'm going to make you pay.

90
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,277
Unlikely.

91
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,796
I'm more powerful than I've ever been.

92
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,715
And the last time we met

93
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,342
you barely managed to hold your own.

94
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,803
Funny. That's not how I remember it.

95
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,764
Allow me to refresh your memory.

96
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,439
- I have to go help. - I know.

97
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,069
Find shelter. I'll be back as soon as I can.

98
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,075
Blue Devil got me close enough to get a good look.

99
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:39,119
<i>Those big burrowing machines are Magma Tappers.</i>

100
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,330
At least now we know what they're trying to do.

101
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,457
The invaders are setting up drilling machines

102
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,459
to tap the heat at the Earth's core.

103
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,086
They're trying to create fire pits.

104
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:49,880
If they succeed, it's apocalypse on Earth.

105
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,256
They won't succeed.

106
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,217
Your primary targets are those drills.

107
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,886
<i>Destroy them at all costs.</i>

108
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,971
You heard the man. Rock 'n' roll.

109
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,233
Looks like the main power coupling.

110
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,276
Cover my backside.

111
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,066
Get out of here. It's gonna blow.

112
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,700
Yeah!

113
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:04,329
We gotta find a way to take this out for good.

114
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,541
Why don't you just throw it to the sun?

115
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,543
Yeah, I guess it was a pretty stupid idea.

116
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,086
<i>No. Maybe you're onto something.</i>

117
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,088
But I'll need more leverage and a trench.

118
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,297
On it.

119
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,974
Now what?

120
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,311
Oh, cool.

121
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,901
Doesn't look like it quite made escape velocity.

122
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,277
Nope.

123
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,740
Good effort though.

124
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,971
Don't leave us yet, Kal-El.

125
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,390
I want you to see your adopted home world

126
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,392
bow down before me.

127
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,104
Only then will I allow you death's sweet release.

128
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:23,825
Parademons, dispose of these annoyances.

129
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,037
Excuse me.

130
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,183
Get away from here. It's not safe.

131
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,978
Don't worry. I'm here to help.

132
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,189
I appreciate your intent...

133
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,819
Hera!

134
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,962
- J'onn! - Good to see you, Diana.

135
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,547
I've got a lot to tell you about.

136
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,216
- We'll catch up later. - Wouldn't miss it.

137
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,801
First things first.

138
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,824
- Problem? - I'm out.

139
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,410
- Take my extra. - Not my style.

140
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:49,619
Suit yourself.

141
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,039
I'm planning to live through this.

142
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,557
Flea.

143
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,442
Impressive.

144
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,445
No one has ever avoided my Omega Beam.

145
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,490
I wonder if the other one is as agile.

146
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,000
- Excellent strategy. - Luthor!

147
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,716
Your friends have abandoned you or fallen before my might.

148
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,520
Super or otherwise...

149
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,231
you're merely a man...

150
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,775
and I am a God.

151
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:21,294
You, Metron, you knew this was going to happen.

152
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,005
This outcome was the most likely possible result

153
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,007
of your foolhardy actions.

154
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,384
You can help me.

155
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,511
I demand that you help me!

156
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,389
You are in no position to make demands of anyone.

157
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,908
I warned you that you were dabbling

158
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,684
in forces beyond your comprehension.

159
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,145
You'd be surprised what I can comprehend.

160
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,772
For instance, if you know so much about Darkseid

161
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,607
I'll wager you know how to beat him.

162
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,651
There is one possibility.

163
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,237
One thing in all the universe that might...

164
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,989
But no. The risk is...

165
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:52,451
I know a little something about risk myself.

166
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,328
Care for an object lesson?

167
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,746
Very well.

168
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,207
I will take you where you want to go.

169
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,762
You still try to fight.

170
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,268
Can't you see that it's hopeless?

171
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:29,362
That man won't quit as long

172
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,239
as he can still draw a breath.

173
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,033
None of my teammates will.

174
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,118
Me? I've got a different problem.

175
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard.</i>

176
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,297
Always taking constant care not to break something.

177
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,049
To break someone.

178
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:51,301
Never allowing myself to lose control

179
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,887
even for a moment or someone could die.

180
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,939
But you can take it, can't you, big man.

181
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,441
What we have here is a rare opportunity

182
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,152
for me to cut loose and show you

183
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,863
just how powerful I really am.

184
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:53,488
- Had enough? - Not quite yet.

185
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,544
It's called the Agony Matrix.

186
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:12,257
Direct neural stimulation of pain receptors. All of them.

187
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:15,510
Imagine the worst pain you've ever felt in your life...

188
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,220
times a thousand.

189
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,890
Now imagine that pain continuing forever.

190
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,313
Oh, that's right. You don't have to imagine.

191
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,194
Behold the source wall.

192
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,530
Behind it is the single greatest

193
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,907
secret of the universe.

194
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,076
<i>This is as far as I dare to go.</i>

195
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,956
I warn you one final time.

196
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,917
Only a 12th-level intellect has the slightest hope

197
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,795
of surviving what you're about to experience.

198
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,922
Then I'm overqualified.

199
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,401
Still alive.

200
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,695
You impress me, Kryptonian.

201
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,032
More, your valor has touched my heart.

202
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,408
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

203
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,327
<i>There is still some small part of me</i>

204
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:23,787
<i>that knows mercy.</i>

205
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:27,248
I will end your pain with something special

206
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,210
I've been saving for just this occasion.

207
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:32,462
I'm going to carve out your heart

208
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,298
and put it on a pike in my throne room.

209
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,842
As much as I'd enjoy seeing that

210
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,428
first you've got some business with me.

211
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,097
Sorry it took me so long.

212
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,474
I had to go get my power suit.

213
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,851
You would dare challenge me?

214
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,353
Insanity.

215
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,355
Oh, I'm not here to challenge you, Darkseid.

216
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,940
Quite the contrary.

217
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:54,025
I've got something you want.

218
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,194
The only thing you want.

219
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,616
The Anti-Life Equation.

220
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,952
My gift to you.

221
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,759
- Lex, don't. - It's too late.

222
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,678
It's beautiful.

223
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:22,971
Isn't it?

224
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,890
Yes. Yes, it is.

225
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,627
<i>This has been the scene all over the world.</i>

226
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,463
In the wake of Darkseid defeat

227
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,381
his attacking forces have withdrawn

228
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,092
presumably back to wherever it is they came from.

229
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,052
Thanks to Luthor, of all people.

230
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,180
In many ways, Lex Luthor represents

231
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,182
the worst mankind has to offer.

232
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,184
But he died saving us all.

233
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,060
I doubt that either of them died.

234
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,355
- We saw it this time. - You saw it last time, too.

235
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,525
What's the old saying? "Believe half of what you see."

236
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,360
"And none of what you hear."

237
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,653
They'll be back.

238
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,489
And we'll be ready for them.

239
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,073
Meanwhile, it's past time

240
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,051
that Luthor's partners in crime were locked up.

241
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,160
Wait a minute.

242
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:28,828
We helped you guys save the world

243
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,705
<i>and we don't even get any consideration?</i>

244
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:37,545
You're right. Five minute head start.

245
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,839
Five minutes? Are you kidding?

246
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,925
Four minutes, fifty seconds.

247
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,062
I should be back in time for dinner.

248
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,023
- I love you, too. - These are the end times.

249
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,152
A head start.

250
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,029
You're getting soft in your old age.

251
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,449
Don't you have a tall building to go leap?

252
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,077
And the adventure continues.
