1
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,453
Lex, stop it!

2
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,497
You will blow us all to pieces!

3
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:42,083
Not now, woman! Something's happening.

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,544
It's... it's...

5
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:58,057
It's just one more steaming flop.

6
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,274
Baby...

7
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:07,775
Nothing works!

8
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,782
Lex, forget bringing back Brainiac.

9
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,785
I don't need input from some crystal-gazing parasite!

10
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,996
One who's confused a wench's grip on power

11
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:21,581
with the real thing!

12
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,128
This is the real trouble-maker for us.

13
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,921
It's pure wild goose chase.

14
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,464
Look, I will prove it.

15
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,300
I will show you what is in there.

16
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:33,759
Don't be stupid.

17
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,053
This is science. What good is your sorcery?

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,639
Unless you plan to turn stone into gold?

19
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,974
Or maybe a frog?

20
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:41,350
Such ignorance.

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,894
Transmutation is what you want to do!

22
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,479
Transmutation is...

23
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:48,524
What are you waiting for? Do it!

24
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,401
- Okay! - Okay!

25
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,075
By the slaughter of the innocent

26
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,622
by pestilence and plague, reveal the hidden unto me.

27
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,460
There, you see? Just a rock.

28
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,003
A worthless piece of...

29
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,546
What?

30
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,089
It's not important.

31
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,592
Show me!

32
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,977
Critical system failure in three seconds.

33
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,647
Two seconds.

34
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,565
One second.

35
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,531
No, keep the image!

36
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,460
There is still Brainiac in the universe.

37
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,837
There is no way to tell where it happened.

38
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,046
Wrong.

39
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,298
I saw enough of those stars

40
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,676
to determine the explosion's coordinates.

41
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,135
It should be a simple matter.

42
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,304
You saw the wild goose again.

43
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,848
Concentrate on us, baby.

44
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,684
Space is too far.

45
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,853
Together, we can rule this world.

46
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,655
If you like this world so much, keep your fool mouth shut.

47
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:19,949
Then maybe I'll let you keep it.

48
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:24,829
Me, I'm going to be a God again.

49
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,908
Speed it up!

50
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,956
Sinestro, don't forget the floor.

51
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,205
<i>I want radiation shielding</i>

52
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,375
<i>from every direction.</i>

53
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,585
<i>Rampage...</i>

54
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,049
Help Bizarro.

55
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,016
Don't distort the metal, moron!

56
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,352
I don't even know why we're doing this.

57
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,315
Killer Frost, if Weather Wizard here

58
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,859
doesn't shape up I'm holding you accountable.

59
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,068
Whatever.

60
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,530
Structural integrity is crucial.

61
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,949
Okay! Got it.

62
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,158
Geez.

63
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,758
Soon, people, the Secret Society

64
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,802
will no longer exist.

65
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,430
<i>Instead, you'll become the new ruling class of the universe.</i>

66
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,559
You are the lucky few, the chosen

67
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,728
witnesses to the moment I seize my Godhead.

68
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,190
Luthor, what kind of game is this?

69
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,776
Because so far, it's no fun.

70
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,446
Bear with me, Toyman. You'll get the hang of it.

71
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,115
You're going to help me collect

72
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:09,118
some newly discovered pieces of Brainiac.

73
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:10,870
Swell.

74
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:13,414
So you merge with a living computer, like you did before.

75
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:16,500
You become more powerful than all of us put together

76
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,127
but what do we get?

77
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:22,172
You'll all be my lieutenants in the new order.

78
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,592
Of course, if you don't like those terms

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,720
you better stop me now while you still have a chance.

80
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:32,266
But you'd also better remember what happened to poor Goldface.

81
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:44,862
I'm already more powerful than all of you put together.

82
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,907
Excuse me.

83
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,827
Don't take this the wrong way, but what exactly are we doing?

84
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,871
I was coming to that.

85
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,587
I reconfigured Grodd's cloaking field into a hyperspatial drive.

86
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,172
You're not serious!

87
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,049
Little bit.

88
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,893
Why is my headquarters moving?

89
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,397
Hey! What's going on?

90
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,610
I demand to know what's going on!

91
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,153
<i>Quiet, Grodd.</i>

92
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,532
<i>You.</i>

93
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,492
Come to gloat at me again?

94
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,261
I'm not some monkey in a zoo throwing...

95
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,578
Shh.

96
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,707
Listen, I've been very, very bad.

97
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,458
I backed the wrong pony.

98
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,794
It should have been you.

99
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,422
Oh, you finally sussed it out.

100
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,216
That hairless sweetheart of yours isn't a leader.

101
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,760
- He's a thug. - And how.

102
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,055
I don't like to compete for Lex with a dead computer.

103
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,267
I want you to be my man in charge, like before.

104
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:42,187
So, baby, what do you want?

105
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,399
Oh. Why, only you, my dear.

106
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,277
And Luthor's fat head on a plate.

107
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,160
That's one mother of a laser show.

108
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,745
Toyman?

109
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,789
We should be reaching the Brainiac remnants soon.

110
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,585
By the way, thank you for making me your navigator, Luthor.

111
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,171
I always love learning a new controller.

112
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,964
Just keep us on course.

113
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,133
The slightest error, and we're dead.

114
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,640
I wouldn't worry about it, Neanderthal.

115
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,479
The way I see it, you're dead either way.

116
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,487
I'd like to complete this transaction

117
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,364
with as little bloodshed as possible, Lex.

118
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:39,078
Now, put your hands up and have Toyman turn us around.

119
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:41,288
Don't look at him, big boy.

120
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,790
Grodd is leader.

121
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,054
Luthor?

122
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,089
Finish that off!

123
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:55,028
Giganta, you're out of jail.

124
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,488
How's your head?

125
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,867
Pretty good, considering you tried to fry my brain.

126
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,413
Don't get grabby, thunder thighs.

127
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,373
Grodd is mine now.

128
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,391
Hey.

129
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,613
One creepsicle coming up.

130
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,117
You are so annoying.

131
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:55,088
<i>Trapped like a rat.</i>

132
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:01,011
It's very weird.

133
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,181
You were never so much fun when we were together.

134
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,151
You wouldn't believe what this cost me.

135
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,542
Around the world.

136
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,382
Rock the cradle.

137
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,639
Sleeper.

138
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,485
Luthor! Look out!

139
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,851
Give it up, Lex.

140
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,229
You're only delaying the inevitable.

141
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,731
You're right.

142
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,157
if it's all the same to you

143
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,744
I'd rather snap your neck with my bare hands.

144
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,512
You know, this mutiny was easy.

145
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,098
The Secret Society hates you.

146
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,768
Ah! Like they love you.

147
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,275
Idiotic simian!

148
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,277
Half-baked objectivist!

149
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,075
You're ill-equipped to lead, Lex.

150
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:32,204
A lower primate, masquerading as an intellectual.

151
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:36,666
I'm the more accomplished, both physically and mentally.

152
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,134
Took you long enough.

153
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,096
I was beginning to think I'd figured you wrong.

154
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:52,349
Now, bow down to me.

155
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,900
Who is master here?

156
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,778
You... are.

157
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,279
Get up.

158
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,452
Take six steps forward.

159
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,799
Get in.

160
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,353
I should have let you rot in jail.

161
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,646
Goodbye, Grodd.

162
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,441
It could have gone the other way.

163
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,360
It really could have, couldn't it?

164
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,569
No.

165
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,572
But why speak ill of the dead?

166
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:59,416
You twisted pink rat-hole of a hominid, I'm not done with you!

167
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,169
I'll get out of this, and when I do...

168
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:10,552
Can any of you give me one good reason to let you live?

169
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,442
Killer Frost, you've got a future.

170
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,902
Get rid of the rest.

171
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,445
You got it.

172
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,658
We're here.

173
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,917
Darling, Grodd must have used mind control.

174
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,045
Okay, maybe not.

175
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,548
But, baby, you don't ever doubt that I love you, correct?

176
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,885
I-I-I know I did something bad.

177
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:53,303
I'm a sick person.

178
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,388
You don't know what it's like to be me.

179
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,557
Don't be afraid, darling.

180
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,310
You still have a big role in my plan.

181
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,897
In fact, I can't do this without you.

182
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,030
I used to think magic was unknowable

183
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,824
unpredictable, and not to be trusted.

184
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,035
You've taught me so much, Tala.

185
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,204
Even my wealth of scientific knowledge

186
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:21,998
would never have been up to this task.

187
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,917
<i>You will be the mystic conduit</i>

188
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,128
<i>that will siphon Brainiac's essence from the debris.</i>

189
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,340
<i>I'll be able to reconstitute him from that energy.</i>

190
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,384
<i>But I doubt you'll see it.</i>

191
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,512
You planned this all along. Even before I...

192
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,681
I'm a sick person, too.

193
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,850
Luthor, the collection panels are in place.

194
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,019
<i>Lex, please!</i>

195
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,521
I beg you!

196
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,314
Hold that thought.

197
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,233
Do it!

198
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,486
I said, do it!

199
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,572
He cannot hear you, Lex Luthor.

200
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,906
Time has stopped.

201
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,202
We exist between two ticks of the clock.

202
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,289
In my travels through the myriad paths of infinity

203
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,208
I have seen the first and the last.

204
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,211
But what you do today threatens the entire universe

205
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,506
past, present, and future.

206
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,216
I should hope it does.

207
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,010
Look, I didn't catch the name.

208
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:18,221
Metron, scientist and chronicler.

209
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,391
Well, Metron, I'll soon be ready for anything

210
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,393
the universe can throw at me.

211
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,228
I'm about to become a God.

212
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,397
You don't know what a God is.

213
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,941
Or what you are unleashing.

214
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,111
Tampering with forces beyond my ken, and so forth?

215
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,487
Nice try.

216
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,948
If you want my power, make your move.

217
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,075
Otherwise, you can get lost.

218
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,286
You will regret your decision.

219
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:42,579
We all will.

220
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,000
♪ Twinkle twinkle Brainiac ♪

221
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,003
♪ Tala's gonna bring you back ♪

222
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:52,546
Lex!

223
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,726
Brainiac, I'm coming.

224
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:24,371
People, meet your new lord and master!

225
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,345
It seems I have you to thank for my resurrection.

226
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,722
Though your world will suffer slowly

227
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,392
I grant you a quick death.

228
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,839
That rodent thunderbar thinks he can rule Apokolips

229
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,674
in Darkseid's stead.

230
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,217
We'll be the ones who deliver

231
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,178
his pestilent corpse to Granny Goodness.

232
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,801
Welcome home, oh, mighty Darkseid.

233
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,346
Arise, my children.

234
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,476
Let this meaningless battle for control end today.

235
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,978
Of course, lord.

236
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,647
We had thought ourselves bereft forever.

237
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,483
Only the slimmest of chances

238
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:19,194
has allowed me to overcome my death

239
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,446
at the hands of Superman.

240
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,531
But let the universe howl in despair

241
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,909
for I have returned.

242
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,664
What is your will, my lord?

243
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,168
As ever, to search for the Anti-Life Equation

244
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:38,505
that I may bring order to this aimless universe.

245
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:42,759
But first, Superman must suffer for killing me.

246
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,720
His adopted world will die screaming.

247
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,556
Only then will I seek the ultimate end.

248
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,100
Forgive me, lord, but an attack on Earth

249
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,645
would violate your pact with Highfather.

250
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:56,648
New Genesis would doubtless retaliate.

251
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:59,234
Where do you think I'm going next?

252
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,325
<i>Superman!</i>

253
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,829
You'd better get outside, quick!

254
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,764
We have a little problem.
