1
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,557
I know you are here, Boston Brand.

2
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,687
What's the point of being a flipping ghost

3
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,106
if you can't even sneak up on people?

4
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,542
For that matter, what's the point of me

5
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,068
being a ghost, period?

6
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:30,029
It's been over a year since I caught the man who murdered me.

7
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,782
So, your work here is done?

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,035
You are ready to pass on to the next level?

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,703
I don't know what ready means.

10
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,705
But I feel like I've done my time.

11
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,750
And yet, here you are.

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,252
"Here you are"?

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,295
What kind of lousy wisdom is "Here you are"?

14
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:50,216
If you seek knowledge, you have but to ask.

15
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,051
I've avenged my own death.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,719
Why am I still here?

17
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,014
Your destiny is not to avenge your own death.

18
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,226
Your destiny is to avenge mine.

19
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:01,435
What?

20
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,292
Grodd never sends us anyplace nice.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,169
His humble one begs your forgiveness.

22
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:32,550
But to enter this sacred place, the right must be earned.

23
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,557
Keep the change.

24
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,314
His humble one begs your forgiveness...

25
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,943
but no outsider is permitted in the temple of Nandeparvak.

26
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:20,741
That's cute, kid. Get out of the way or I'll spank you.

27
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,993
This would also not be permitted.

28
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:31,919
Little Bruce Lee's got your number.

29
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,088
Lucky thing you got us for backup.

30
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:37,341
This humble one would not presume to fight you alone.

31
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,186
Now things are getting interesting.

32
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,363
Take them down.

33
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:26,265
Bizarro, you despise me, right?

34
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,310
Uh-huh. Bizarro hate Luthor.

35
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,395
He do anything for him.

36
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,105
Good. I mean, bad.

37
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,316
Anyway, take care of those monks.

38
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,524
Okay.

39
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,515
Stand aside or you're dead.

40
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:11,477
In the fullness of time, we are all dead.

41
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,157
This is not the way to end my life.

42
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,846
Master!

43
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,564
Do not waste your time, Boston Brand.

44
00:05:56,772 --> 00:06:02,069
This portion of my journey has come to an end.

45
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,529
But...

46
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,740
We will meet again.

47
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,583
I'm gonna make you pay!

48
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,764
Rampage, what's wrong with you?

49
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,437
She has been possessed.

50
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,405
Oh, undead spirit!

51
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,200
What just happened?

52
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:59,877
This is it, the heart of Nandeparvak.

53
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,940
We have what we came for.

54
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:22,148
It's time to leave.

55
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,770
I have done as you asked, Lord Grodd.

56
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,106
Get off your knees, woman.

57
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,483
Not until my master says so.

58
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,735
Excellent work, my dear.

59
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,696
You may rise.

60
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,408
You're pathetic, debasing yourself like that.

61
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,410
I owe Grodd everything.

62
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:18,831
I would still be trapped in that mirror if he hadn't freed me.

63
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,126
When Giganta gets out of prison, she ain't gonna appreciate you

64
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,294
hanging on to her boyfriend like that.

65
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,005
That's her problem.

66
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:29,216
Giganta's not nearly enough woman for Grodd.

67
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,844
True.

68
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,555
If you're quite finished demonstrating what an alpha male

69
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,141
you are, maybe you'd care to explain what you intend to do

70
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,475
with that thing.

71
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,520
I already told you, but you won't accept it.

72
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,230
You don't believe in magic.

73
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,898
It's not a matter of belief.

74
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm just unaccustomed to working

75
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,902
with something I don't fully understand.

76
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,488
As long as the amplifier you built for me works...

77
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,157
It does.

78
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,410
Then consider this an exotic power source.

79
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:58,704
You don't need to understand anything more.

80
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,832
You can't produce a carrier wave of the amplitude

81
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,556
you're talking about with this building's

82
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,084
cloaking-field generator.

83
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,503
So you've convinced me.

84
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,922
I don't intend to use our field generator.

85
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,591
You're planning to build one?

86
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,968
Luthor, Luthor, Luthor.

87
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,013
Why build when we can take what we want.

88
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,098
Gentlemen, shall we go?

89
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,400
<i>Rama Kushna, just like you to show up too late to help.</i>

90
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,403
<i>Your impertinence is refreshing as always.</i>

91
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,698
<i>But have a care, the Gods are capricious.</i>

92
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,366
What do you want from me?

93
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,743
The master is dead.

94
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,495
They're all dead.

95
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:43,248
<i>Do not presume to lecture me on the nature of reality.</i>

96
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>The monks have not yet passed from this plane.</i>

97
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,669
They're in some kind of coma?

98
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,671
<i>That is as close to the truth as you</i>

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>are capable of comprehending.</i>

100
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,803
<i>You must retrieve the heart of Nandeparvak</i>

101
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:00,349
<i>or they will remain in their current state for all time.</i>

102
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,725
<i>I have spoken.</i>

103
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,272
How the heck am I supposed to do that?

104
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,071
<i>Is that really everything?</i>

105
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,280
We're done.

106
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,908
- All reports filed. - Good.

107
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,877
What do you guys say we get something to eat?

108
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,274
We hardly ever spend time together when we're not working.

109
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,664
Sounds good to me.

110
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm tired of commissary food.

111
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,710
I'd like to, Diana, but I've been away from Gotham too long.

112
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,296
Come on, Bruce. I know a burger place in Metropolis

113
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,632
that has the best fries on the East Coast

114
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,592
and the milkshakes are so thick...

115
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,137
- I need your help. - That's pretty thick.

116
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,765
I'm serious. I need your help on a mission of vengeance.

117
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,852
Now, don't be alarmed, but I'm not Superman. I'm...

118
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,646
A ghost, inhabiting his body.

119
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,981
Is that you, Boston?

120
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,274
Hiya, Bats.

121
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,442
When I'm working, people call me Deadman.

122
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,403
You know this... ghost?

123
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:57,698
Yeah, Batman helped me solve my own murder a while back.

124
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,825
Now, I need your help again.

125
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,493
If you hurt Superman, I'll...

126
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,745
Relax. He doesn't even know I'm in here.

127
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,914
We can't see or hear him otherwise.

128
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,041
Once he leaves, Superman will be fine.

129
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,250
It's like he says.

130
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,919
Why are you still around?

131
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,755
I thought once your murder was solved, your exile was ended.

132
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,424
You and me, both.

133
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,093
You know how they say no good deed goes unpunished?

134
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,142
I guess I shot my mouth off to the wrong deity.

135
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,597
What's this about?

136
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:24,683
A bunch of Supervillains busted into Nandeparvak

137
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,561
and stole a mystic totem filled with the souls

138
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,356
of hundreds of monks, and they killed the master.

139
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,735
Batman?

140
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,237
He knew the master even before I did.

141
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,448
He was one of my martial-arts teachers.

142
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,492
With all the power in this body, it'd be easy to punish

143
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,329
the men responsible, if I could find them.

144
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,582
That's not the master's way... or yours.

145
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,917
We'll find them and we'll see

146
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,961
that justice is done, not vengeance.

147
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,048
Yeah, fun to think about, though.

148
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,443
Let's go up to ops and see if you can't pick the bad guys

149
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,552
out of a photo array.

150
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,180
You're sure that's not the magician you saw?

151
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,766
Nope. All the rest of 'em are right on, though.

152
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,614
<i>First sign of Luthor since Shayera saw him</i>

153
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,061
on Blackhawk Island.

154
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,646
What's he up to?

155
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,357
<i>This seems like it might be bigger than Luthor.</i>

156
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,443
Agent Faraday told me Devil Ray escaped from prison.

157
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,237
And Bizarro showing up again?

158
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,571
And all the odd teams

159
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,531
of previously unaffiliated villains?

160
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,909
Whose brains have conveniently been shorting out

161
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,661
when we question them.

162
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,705
Do you guys remember the one bit of information J'onn was able

163
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,458
to pull out of Giganta's mind before it shut down?

164
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,043
Grodd.

165
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,462
Think he's put together a new secret society?

166
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,381
Except this time, he's doing a better job

167
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:38,674
of keeping the secret.

168
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:39,882
So, how do we find them?

169
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,426
I wish I could help.

170
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,097
I can feel the psychic screams of the souls they stole.

171
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:46,974
But I can't pinpoint a location.

172
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,768
All I get are images of Africa.

173
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,479
I know, a continent doesn't much narrow things down

174
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,688
but it's all I can...

175
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,730
Gorilla City.

176
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,441
He's gone back home.

177
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,527
Solovar, this is Batman.

178
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>What a coincidence. I was just about to call you.</i>

179
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:02,906
Wanted to give you a heads up.

180
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,343
We've got reason to believe that Grodd's headed your way.

181
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,202
You don't say, that might explain the armies

182
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,204
of supervillains attacking the city.

183
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,413
<i>How bad?</i>

184
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,165
All but taken over.

185
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,060
They're already holding the central control building.

186
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,964
We could use some help if you have any to spare.

187
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,671
Can't chat.

188
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,880
<i>Signing off.</i>

189
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,549
Gorilla City?

190
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,797
A hidden city of super- intelligent talking gorillas

191
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,430
with technology far beyond anything humans have created.

192
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,056
No, really?

193
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,625
You're the ghost from the Himalayas

194
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,768
having trouble believing this?

195
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,977
Point.

196
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,445
You know, when they beam down on that TV show, they never miss.

197
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,530
We didn't miss either.

198
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,034
It's a force field, but it also hides the city from prying eyes.

199
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,328
Looks like a job for Superman.

200
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,915
You're wasting time.

201
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,251
Go in as a ghost, find the central control building

202
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,045
and shut down the shield generator.

203
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,755
We'll follow as soon as we can.

204
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,049
Yeah, okay.

205
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:04,259
You have to eat them with a spoon.

206
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,844
What am I doing in Africa?

207
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,741
You two, Devil Ray wants you outside right now.

208
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:31,244
Go on, I'll take care of things here.

209
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,222
You'd think the thing would be a big, red button

210
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,248
or at least have a sign on it or something.

211
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,875
The heck with it.

212
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,548
That's our cue.

213
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,967
Skull, what do you think you're doing?

214
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,804
I gotta say, I don't have a good answer for ya.

215
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:50,097
It's the ghost.

216
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,099
He's here again.

217
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,852
But this time, I will take care of him for good.

218
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:09,574
I cannot destroy him.

219
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,719
Can you at least get him out of our hair for a bit?

220
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:15,789
Yes. I banish you from this place, evil spirit.

221
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,303
We lost shield power for 41 seconds

222
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,721
before the backup kicked in.

223
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,973
We have to assume...

224
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,599
That the Justice League is here.

225
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,939
They're headed this way.

226
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,668
We need more time to complete our work.

227
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,816
Then, it won't matter.

228
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,985
I'm on it.

229
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,320
Bizarro.

230
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,657
Superman is your best friend.

231
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,992
Do you understand?

232
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,702
Bizarro understand.

233
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,370
Superman am friend.

234
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,080
Bizarro must kill him.

235
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,085
You killed my teacher, my friend.

236
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,463
You'll have to be more specific, lady.

237
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,924
I've killed a lot of people.

238
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:50,884
The old monk.

239
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,769
What are you waiting for?

240
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:04,147
You want revenge? Take it.

241
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,691
No. That's not what he would have wanted.

242
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,493
Next time, ask permission!

243
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,994
Tala, we're ready for the heart.

244
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,958
Good.

245
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,169
Then, all I have to do is install this mind-control module

246
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,923
and you'll be able to project your will over the entire world.

247
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,092
Present company excepted, of course.

248
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,887
Actually, that's just what I wanted you to think.

249
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,598
My true plans are far more grand.

250
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,933
Tala?

251
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,230
Some sort of genetic reconfiguration matrix?

252
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:48,567
You show impressive intellect for a homo sapien.

253
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,987
Using the massive carrier-wave that, thanks to you

254
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,657
Gorilla City's shield generator can now produce.

255
00:17:55,865 --> 00:18:00,579
I'm about to send a signal that will rewrite human DNA.

256
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,999
A devolution ray that will turn every man, woman

257
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:07,502
and child on earth into an ape!

258
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,563
You okay?

259
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,648
Yeah. Let's wrap this up.

260
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,238
Oh, come on!

261
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,455
Why am I not surprised?

262
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:51,630
Don't bother.

263
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,548
It's too late.

264
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,508
Tell me how to stop it.

265
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,177
Get us out of here, Tala.

266
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,176
ls everything okay?

267
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,470
Well, I'm sort of missing flash's obligatory joke

268
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,263
about how Grodd made a monkey out of us.

269
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,391
Just couldn't let it go unsaid.

270
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,643
Obligatory.

271
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,186
That's it, guys, yuck it up.

272
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,938
You saved the world, but I failed.

273
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,524
Everyone in Nandeparvak is gone...

274
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,651
forever.

275
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,459
We're in your debt again, Justice League.

276
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,322
If only Luthor and Grodd hadn't gotten away.

277
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,700
If it's any consolation, we picked up nearly a dozen

278
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:05,537
of his superpowered cronies, with more to come, I'm sure.

279
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:17,507
No, I didn't mean it.

280
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,936
Bruce, Deadman took over your body.

281
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,145
It wasn't your fault.

282
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,276
Let me explain.

283
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,324
He would have shot her. I didn't have a choice.

284
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,286
<i>Boston Brand, your actions led to the death of another.</i>

285
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:47,537
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,746
I didn't mean to.

287
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:51,040
<i>Intentions are immaterial.</i>

288
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,293
<i>You were gifted with power to be used</i>

289
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,671
<i>to balance the scales of karma.</i>

290
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,050
<i>Because of your actions, the scale now is unbalanced.</i>

291
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,719
Unbalanced?

292
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,512
Thanks to Devil Ray and his team

293
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,556
the master and all the other monks are dead.

294
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,308
<i>Incorrect.</i>

295
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,226
<i>When the heart was shattered</i>

296
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,146
<i>the essence of the monks was set free.</i>

297
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,819
<i>Even now, their souls return to their rightful places.</i>

298
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:38,505
No one dies in Nandeparvak but the scales are unbalanced.

299
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:42,383
<i>Your work in this world is not yet done.</i>

300
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,848
Since there's only one monkey left around here

301
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,937
I'm assuming that the Justice League found a way

302
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,102
to stop the carrier wave.

303
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,355
There's more than one way to peel a banana.

304
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:56,940
Next time...

305
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:59,359
I wasn't going to do this for another few weeks

306
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,902
but seriously...

307
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,405
turning all of humanity into apes?

308
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,200
That was your master plan?

309
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,041
Listen up.

310
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,503
From now on, I'm in charge of this operation.

311
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:20,839
Anybody got a problem with that?

312
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,721
No problem at all, baby.
