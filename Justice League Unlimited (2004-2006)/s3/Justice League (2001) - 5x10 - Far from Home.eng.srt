1
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:15,096
This stinks, Brainy

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,724
I hate running from a fight.

3
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,368
They'll never think to look for us here

4
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,120
that gives us a chance to mount a counterattack.

5
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,270
Attack how?

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,147
There's only the two of us left.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,274
Yes, I've been giving that problem some thought.

8
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:31,197
Oh, no, I know you're a level 12 mega genius

9
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:33,449
but you are seriously out of your mind.

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,992
There's no other option.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,994
All of our teammates have been captured.

12
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,247
To save them, we'll have to break the laws of time

13
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:40,873
and recruit heroes from the past.

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,833
But messing with history?

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,877
That's risky, even for us.

16
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,338
Incomplete records from the 21 st century

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,007
show that three members of the legendary Justice League

18
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,592
once came to the future.

19
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,136
My research indicates now is that time.

20
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,930
I did my homework, too, Brainy.

21
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,808
The histories say three heroes came to the future.

22
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,018
But only two of them ever made it home.

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,716
You're ready, Supergirl?

24
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:16,344
Dude, I was born ready.

25
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,477
That tickles.

26
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,357
Kaboom

27
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:36,530
I'll take that, thanks.

28
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,967
So, Queen Bee and Dr. Cyber?

29
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,844
Not much of a workout.

30
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,639
Hear that, Ollie? Kara thinks it's too easy.

31
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,641
Well, we wouldn't want her to get bored.

32
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,658
I hate you.

33
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:41,761
Some kid, huh?

34
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,514
Today's her 21 st birthday

35
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,083
but she'd rather be here practicing

36
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,851
than go out on the town with me and Dinah.

37
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,059
Good for her.

38
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,227
Hey, at least we wanted

39
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,438
to spend some time with her.

40
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,440
You ever think about how she must feel?

41
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,983
She's always an outsider.

42
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,193
I know a little bit about that myself, Ollie.

43
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,822
Just a little. You came to Earth as a baby, grew up here.

44
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,115
Kara spent most of her life

45
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,491
on a planet with technology

46
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,885
hundreds of years ahead of ours.

47
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,029
<i>She's got to feel like she's</i>

48
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,203
<i>trapped in the stone age.</i>

49
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,289
I've tried to make her feel at home.

50
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,751
How? Seems to me, you treat her just like another cape.

51
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,795
I was never happy about Kara going into the family business

52
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,631
but now that she's decided it's what she wants to do

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,968
I've tried to step back and let her develop into her own person.

54
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,657
I didn't want her living in the shadow

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,722
of being Superman's cousin.

56
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,516
This may shock you, but she's proud to be your cousin

57
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,144
she even changed her costume to look more like yours.

58
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,522
Yes and I'm very proud.

59
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,608
But don't tell her.

60
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,028
No, that's a job for Superman.

61
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,161
- Well? - Well, what?

62
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,472
Aren't you gonna give me notes

63
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,289
about all the stuff I screwed up?

64
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,124
No notes, Kara.

65
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,335
I've got nothing left to teach you.

66
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,091
Not bad, kiddo, you set a new record for the simulation.

67
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,353
Kara!

68
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,655
I'm certain that this must be disorienting for you.

69
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,115
- My name is... - Brainiac!

70
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,325
Yes, how did you...

71
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,539
Please, calm down

72
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,082
I'm not going to hurt you.

73
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,501
Whoa, sparky

74
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,128
let's hear what he has to say.

75
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,380
Thank you.

76
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,131
Yes, I am a Brainiac

77
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,675
but I'm not a machine.

78
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,301
I'm organic.

79
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,011
The universe conquering Brainiac

80
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,639
you knew is my distant ancestor.

81
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,128
<i>Over time, he learned how to pass</i>

82
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,767
<i>his code down biologically.</i>

83
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,186
I am Brainiac 5.

84
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,039
Think of me as the black sheep of my family

85
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,481
dedicated to doing good to make up

86
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,233
for my ancestor's legacy of evil.

87
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:02,570
And you demonstrated that by kidnapping us?

88
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,031
We'd have never done it if the situation wasn't so dire.

89
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,492
Where are we, anyway?

90
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,495
Approximately 1,000 years into your future

91
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,706
in what you'd call the 31 st century.

92
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:16,000
Time travel, swell.

93
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,002
It's a real thrill for me to meet you, sir.

94
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,462
You're the famous John Stewart, father of...

95
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,299
You wanna shut up before you create a time paradox?

96
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:24,633
Sorry.

97
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:29,138
Chuck Taine, codename, Bouncing Boy.

98
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,056
Why did you bring us here?

99
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,895
We're part of a group called the Legion Of Superheroes.

100
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:39,607
<i>A galaxy spanning force, none unlike your Justice League.</i>

101
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:42,151
A team of criminals called the Fatal Five attacked

102
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,570
our new headquarters and captured all our teammates.

103
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,178
They must have something big planned

104
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,865
to risk taking on the Legion.

105
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,658
But we can't figure what it is.

106
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,494
We needed help, so we set the time bubble to bring back

107
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,246
some of Earth's greatest heroes.

108
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,748
But why us?

109
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:59,001
It-it was random, we'd have taken anyone.

110
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,045
Okay, so how can we help?

111
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,880
Whoa, time out.

112
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,638
Just because he's seriously cute

113
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,514
doesn't mean we should trust a Brainiac.

114
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm not getting a bad vibe off the kid.

115
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,019
Apparently neither are you.

116
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,938
Seriously cute, huh?

117
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,566
The date we pulled her from

118
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,610
is exactly when Supergirl vanished

119
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,362
from the historical records.

120
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,781
Brainy, she's going to die.

121
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,240
We have to tell her.

122
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,368
No, telling her could change history.

123
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,787
Keep quiet, Chuck. That's an order.

124
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,289
You know, Brainiac, being organic and having

125
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,750
a heart, not the same thing.

126
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,045
We're in. What's next?

127
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,049
The lab's this way.

128
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,337
The tech is out of date, but we should find enough...

129
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,487
A Green Lantern, that's a rare sight in this galaxy these days.

130
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,782
Take a good look, he won't be here long.

131
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,849
So what's your power? Super strength, speed?

132
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,559
I have a 12th level intellect.

133
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,020
Great, you can knock them out with your diploma.

134
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,821
That was unnecessary, my belt protects me from any impact.

135
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,740
Maybe I was just trying to cop a feel.

136
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,390
Empress.

137
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,960
You'll find the Emerald Eye of Ekron more than a match

138
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,378
for your ring.

139
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:55,844
On your feet.

140
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,810
Ohh, what?

141
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,258
You've got to free the others...

142
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,900
Forget them, we have the Green Lantern, let's go!

143
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,074
Ohh, what's going on?

144
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,921
<i>Can you track them with those things?</i>

145
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,507
Not yet, but I've identified the technology.

146
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,175
They're Scion receptors.

147
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,095
Hey, that soda machine in the lobby still works.

148
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,140
Oh, thanks.

149
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:43,308
Back on Argos, we use Scionic technology

150
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,060
for our remote controls.

151
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,480
When we lost one, you just had to think at it, and it'd beep.

152
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,773
Don't know why we bothered

153
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,942
they were always in the couch cushions.

154
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,694
Good idea, but it won't work.

155
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,530
The Fatal Five are masking the carrier wave somehow.

156
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,907
So, I have to know.

157
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,201
Why'd you save me first?

158
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,810
My decision was based on pure logic.

159
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,954
Really?

160
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,956
Because Green Lantern's the most powerful.

161
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,245
No offense, but I really don't think you could follow

162
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,211
the reasoning of a 12th level intellect such as my own.

163
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,880
Guess not.

164
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,691
Hey, Kara, wanna get me one of those drinks?

165
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,258
Oh, sure.

166
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,054
Admit it, genius, you're in love with her.

167
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,764
Ludicrous, we just met.

168
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,226
Moreover, as a Coluan, I'm ruled by intellect, not emotion.

169
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,854
So in love with her.

170
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:32,983
Increased sweat gland production, shortness of breath

171
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,402
inability to concentrate...

172
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,239
I thought it was guilt, but I am in love.

173
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,490
How did you know?

174
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,409
Just call me Cupid, junior.

175
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,244
I never miss.

176
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,206
I'm gonna raid this dump.

177
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,707
See if I can't upgrade my arrows

178
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,125
with some future tech.

179
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,044
I'll be gone for a long time

180
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,714
so you two are stuck with each other, alone.

181
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,466
For a long time.

182
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,730
You had the superior weapons

183
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,565
and the advantage of surprise.

184
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,944
Explain to me how you failed to capture Brainiac 5?

185
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:20,489
Watch your tone, half a man, I'd hardly call capturing

186
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,282
a Green Lantern a failure.

187
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,576
<i>He's more powerful than a dozen Brainiacs.</i>

188
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,788
Perhaps, but that was never part of the plan.

189
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,374
You have to learn to improvise, Tharok.

190
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,750
We're better armed than ever

191
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,127
to strike against the United Planets.

192
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,714
After that, the universe will be ours for the taking.

193
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:42,885
What's that?

194
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,970
A legion flight ring

195
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,055
all of us have one.

196
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,475
So, does this mean we're going steady?

197
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,607
Trust me, a thousand years ago, that joke was hilarious.

198
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,901
I thought since I couldn't trace the control disk

199
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,946
maybe I could trace the missing Legionnaires' rings.

200
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,656
But it was another dead end.

201
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,575
It's a shame our Justice League comlinks don't work here.

202
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,912
We could track Green Lantern by his transponder.

203
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,540
Come to think of it, we still could if we had a...

204
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:14,376
Quantum tunneling RF transponder.

205
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,836
Hold that thought.

206
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,556
Yeah, this looks like it could do some damage.

207
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,308
<i>Get up here, Brainiac's found GL</i>

208
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,607
His signal is coming from this ship.

209
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,086
They're headed right towards the capital of the United Planets.

210
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,362
The Fatal Five has tried to destroy it before.

211
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,281
And now with GL and the entire Legion

212
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,200
under their control, they just might succeed.

213
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,369
The good news is my personal cruiser runs rings

214
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,621
around their ship. We could still beat them there.

215
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,123
Then what?

216
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,125
We improvise.

217
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,217
<i>Nice ship.</i>

218
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,678
It's strictly no frills, but it's fast.

219
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,138
What do you pilot back home?

220
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,890
Usually just a pickup.

221
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,767
A pickup, is that a type of star cruiser?

222
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,395
Yes, yes, it is.

223
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,688
We're going into orbit.

224
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:18,982
And we've got company.

225
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,283
You guys get aboard that mother ship

226
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,393
and shut down the control devices.

227
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,601
What are you gonna do?

228
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,020
Hold off John and the Legion

229
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,688
until you snap them back to normal.

230
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,149
You won't stand a chance against them.

231
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,819
Maybe, but I'm the only one who does stand a chance

232
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,029
of protecting the capital.

233
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,656
You can't go, because I lo...

234
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,284
Because I lied to you.

235
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,913
Kara, I don't even know you but history says you never

236
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,415
return from this battle.

237
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:17,623
What?

238
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,084
And you knew that all along?

239
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,710
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,380
I had hoped it wouldn't come to this.

241
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,798
I wanted to spare her.

242
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,886
There's still a planet full of people down there

243
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,427
who need our help.

244
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,595
Do your job, and I'm going to do mine.

245
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,013
But...

246
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,016
In case I don't see you again.

247
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,824
Hey, genius.

248
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,911
Hi, how about putting that big brain of yours

249
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,414
to work on a plan to get us aboard the mother ship?

250
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,837
I'll get us in.

251
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,365
I love the direct approach.

252
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,118
The rest of the mission won't be so easy, let's move.

253
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,042
<i>You can do this, Kara.</i>

254
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,836
No biggie, just another practice mission.

255
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,171
Shoot.

256
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,214
I know, I was hoping

257
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,400
they'd be out looking for us.

258
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:32,551
No, shoot!

259
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,262
Obliterate them.

260
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,808
Okay, big guy, that's as far as you go.

261
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,936
You can't stop Validus with that toy.

262
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,897
Rusty, I got him right where I want him.

263
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,693
No!

264
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:08,229
John, stop... Fight it.

265
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,075
Oh, Kara!

266
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,539
I knew what I was doing, but I couldn't stop.

267
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,959
Where are we?

268
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,253
Last thing I remember was...

269
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,797
Oh, no.

270
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,930
Just so you know, the sharp

271
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:43,723
part's on the other end, chief.

272
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,016
Believe me, that's coming.

273
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,773
Tear him to bits.

274
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,191
Slowly.

275
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,429
We wanted to say thanks

276
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:25,014
by making you Honorary Legionnaires.

277
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,643
It's very nice, but I already have a ring.

278
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,438
Don't worry about it, GL, you can't keep it anyway.

279
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:32,886
If you took it home, the future

280
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,941
technology could pollute the time stream.

281
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm keeping mine.

282
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,541
I'm not going back.

283
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,711
Kara...

284
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,846
History says Supergirl never returned from this mission

285
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,474
because she decided to stay in the future.

286
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,788
Whatever abducted them didn't leave

287
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,481
any traceable energy signature.

288
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,858
Maybe Dr. Fate or Zatanna?

289
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,905
Where's Kara?

290
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,865
She asked us to give you this.

291
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,872
Tell ma and pa I love them.

292
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,291
And I love you, too, Clark.

293
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,421
Don't take this the wrong way but I found a place

294
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,298
where I can make a difference.

295
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,177
Where I'm more than just Superman's kid cousin.

296
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:48,056
I... I feel I belong here.

297
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:51,184
Also, I met this boy.

298
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:58,149
You should've seen her, she was amazing.

299
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,902
She's a grown woman now, capable of choosing...

300
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,531
Kara's headstrong, but she's always made good decisions.

301
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,449
I trust her judgment.

302
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,952
But you were right, Ollie.

303
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,037
I wish I had told her.

304
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,747
It's okay, Clark.

305
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,040
She knows.

306
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,212
Now, this boy, Kara likes so much...

307
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,505
does he have a name?
