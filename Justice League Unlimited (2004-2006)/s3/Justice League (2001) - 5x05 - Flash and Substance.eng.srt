1
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,976
Gentlemen, we live in brutal times.

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,395
Last week, to make ends meet, I was reduced to hijacking

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,856
a tractor trailer full of sports cars.

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,816
That is so beneath you.

5
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,860
At least knock over a bank.

6
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,862
You gotta visualize.

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,071
Visualize?

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,740
What the heck does that mean?

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,076
If I don't visualize a mortgage payment soon

10
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:37,620
the wife'll have me bagging groceries for a living.

11
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:40,414
She's always been an ice queen, that one.

12
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:44,210
Captain Boomerang, you old son of a wallaby.

13
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:46,671
Mirror Master, Captain Cold.

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,550
Does me good to see the old faces, even the Trickster.

15
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,009
We heard you were out early.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,428
Time off for good behavior, you might say.

17
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,846
I cut me a good deal.

18
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,182
Got my sentence down to five years.

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,518
And now, they tell me I'm reformed.

20
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,103
Reformed?

21
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,313
The man who robbed an entire fleet of armored cars

22
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,522
in one month?

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,857
Now, that was a crime.

24
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,402
Yeah, too bad The Flash busted you

25
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,650
and you didn't get the chance to spend a dime of it.

26
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,239
And you know what else?

27
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:16,576
Well, at least he didn't make me eat my own laser kaleidoscope.

28
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:19,537
That's a rumor, a complete exaggeration.

29
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,664
And anyway, it was a laser pistol.

30
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,333
It's like that time I stole an entire train

31
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,542
while it was moving.

32
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,919
The way people tell it

33
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,879
you'd think the flash shoved my cold gun...

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,688
You know, I've had him on the ropes, too.

35
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:32,967
Yeah, that's the way I heard it.

36
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:35,469
So, we're the hardest men in town...

37
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,265
What'll it be, boys?

38
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,183
- Arnold Palmer. - Cherry cola.

39
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,395
- Decaf soy-latte. - Milk.

40
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,939
My ulcer's been acting up.

41
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:52,153
The hardest men in town, and we all have something in common.

42
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,696
Bilateral symmetry.

43
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,662
We'd all be living like kings if it weren't for the Flash.

44
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,039
Don't tell me.

45
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:05,166
- I'll say. - Yeah.

46
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:08,502
The Flash has put each of us away at one time or another.

47
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,589
He's interfered with our livelihoods and to complete

48
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:15,343
the insult, the city has honored this Buttinski with a museum.

49
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>Tomorrow is supposed to be the biggest day</i>

50
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,722
<i>in the Flash's life.</i>

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,224
<i>I say we make it his last.</i>

52
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,629
Wally, what do you got for me?

53
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,964
It's kind of great.

54
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,258
The luminol showed a bloodstain on the toe.

55
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,706
Couldn't type it 'cause it was cleaned off with dish soap

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,178
but we went one better.

57
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,222
Turns out the soap is the same brand

58
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,307
as the one in the victim's kitchen.

59
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,144
Nice work. That's the way to nail a crook.

60
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,562
It's one way.

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,522
Hey, I'm taking that half day, remember?

62
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,149
You need anything else?

63
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,817
No. Take off.

64
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,694
- Bye, Wally! - Later, Rick.

65
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,821
- Take care. - Later, Margie.

66
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,031
- Have a good one. - Later, Tony.

67
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,708
Watchtower, table for one.

68
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,296
Hey, guys.

69
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:19,175
So, looks like Superman and GL are in space

70
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:21,010
Wonder Woman's doing disasters...

71
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,636
Why are you here?

72
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,348
Oh, right, uh, 'cause it's Flash Appreciation Day.

73
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,184
Yeah, it'll be great.

74
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:30,227
I understand if everybody's too busy to come.

75
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,104
No biggie.

76
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,397
My mom's gonna be there.

77
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,441
Let's see, my uncle's flying in.

78
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,110
Be great if one of the original seven made it.

79
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,530
I mean, okay, yeah, it's a Flash museum, but to me

80
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,579
the whole league deserves the honor, all of us.

81
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,452
Like I said, no biggie.

82
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,414
- What time? - 6 o'clock.

83
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,958
<i>No. You're really coming?</i>

84
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,294
Awesome. You're a stand up guy, bats.

85
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,838
Don't ever let them call you a crazed loner.

86
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,007
Well, I got a lot to do.

87
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,610
I'm getting the key to the city today

88
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,986
I need to practice my museum speech.

89
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,970
And hey, I better polish my boots.

90
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,602
I can't believe you let that buffoon manipulate you.

91
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,188
You'd never see me at one of these museum openings.

92
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,277
It's not black tie, is it?

93
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,831
Hey, guys, how're they biting?

94
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,792
- Flash! Congrats, man. - Good going!

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,627
Hey, Flash, big day.

96
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,003
Hi, Ed.

97
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,964
Erlene, that bursitis any better?

98
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,217
I'll say. You really know your liniments.

99
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,173
- You're the best, Flash! - You're awesome! Good going!

100
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,060
<i>Help!</i>

101
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:56,021
<i>Mommy!</i>

102
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,065
<i>Help!</i>

103
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,736
Help, mommy!

104
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,656
It's dark and I'm scared.

105
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,157
What's wrong, sweetie?

106
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,366
You lost?

107
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,538
Come on, I'll take you...

108
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,081
Hey!

109
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,604
- Mirror Master. - You're quick as ever.

110
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,398
Yeah, well, you're...

111
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,774
You're not really all there.

112
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,776
Oh, nice try.

113
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,825
If you had another minute, you'd probably think

114
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,113
of a decent comeback.

115
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:51,076
Sadly, you don't have the time.

116
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,378
<i>In another minute, you'll be dead.</i>

117
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,477
I was never fond of you, Flash, but I'm a reasonable man.

118
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,189
<i>If you'd just looked the other way once in a while</i>

119
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,399
<i>we could have coexisted in peace.</i>

120
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,195
Instead, you never let up, so, you've got to go.

121
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,950
That music is what's got to go.

122
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,716
While you're waiting for me to come arrest you

123
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,636
why not take some time and reflect on your mistakes?

124
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,264
Hey, that was pretty good.

125
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,186
<i>For his charitable work</i>

126
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,105
with the city's underprivileged.

127
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:04,066
His bravery during the Thanagarian crisis.

128
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:07,403
And most of all, for his great help reducing crime

129
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:12,574
in Central City, I proclaim this Flash Appreciation Day!

130
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,255
Thanks, mayor. Thanks, folks.

131
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:30,551
Wow, you've all been so great to me over the years.

132
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,428
It really gets to me, you know.

133
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,013
Hope I always make you guys proud.

134
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,807
<i>Aw!</i>

135
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,267
Um, that's all.

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,565
How's it going?

137
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:45,773
Nice slacks.

138
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,693
Thanks! Hey, Mrs. Green.

139
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,879
I didn't forget about painting your fence, Saturday.

140
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,072
Once I get started, it won't take very long.

141
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,366
Tom, we still on for minigolf, Sunday?

142
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,035
Oh, don't tell me.

143
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,414
<i>Boomerangs!</i>

144
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,166
Clear the area!

145
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,470
That should do it.

146
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,557
Duh.

147
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,328
Good day, mate.

148
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:40,954
Captain Boomerang here.

149
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,791
Seems that Mirror Master wasn't up to the task.

150
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>Now, it's my shot.</i>

151
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,003
<i>I'm gonna kill you ugly, Flash</i>

152
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,422
<i>and I want you to see it coming.</i>

153
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,674
I swear, when I get out of this, I'm gonna find you

154
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,009
and hurl all over you.

155
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,677
A touch of dizziness?

156
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,181
You might find it useful to fix on one point on the horizon.

157
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:05,938
For instance, that mountain you're set to crash into.

158
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,035
Flash?

159
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,662
Hey, guys.

160
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,081
You're tied to a very large boomerang.

161
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,289
Yeah.

162
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:26,792
What are you guys doing here?

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,280
The thing isn't for another hour.

164
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,837
Someone means to kill you.

165
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,089
You don't say?

166
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:35,467
Waller told me that Boomerang left Task Force X

167
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,219
so, I did some checking.

168
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:40,430
Three other super criminals from Central City are off the radar.

169
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,142
Hey, Mirror Master took a shot at me, too.

170
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,560
Here's what we're going to do.

171
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:46,353
Listen, I need to go home and change

172
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,602
before the opening tonight.

173
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,064
We're coming with you.

174
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,649
You really don't have to.

175
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,027
We're coming... with you.

176
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:57,197
Okay, but you guys are so slow.

177
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,953
I can't believe you expect us to kick in for that fiasco.

178
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,038
Don't you start pouting, Cold.

179
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,082
That stunt cost me a fortune.

180
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,585
Boomer, must you always plead poverty?

181
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,211
I've got my overhead.

182
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,701
You just pull another mirror out of your blinking arsenal.

183
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,881
What's that cost?

184
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,592
Nothing.

185
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,343
Me next. It's my turn.

186
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,180
Nothing as stupid as a giant boomerang.

187
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:25,350
Firstly, I get 400 cases of fake dog-vomit.

188
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,021
Grease the bottoms of them and when the Flash runs into them

189
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:33,150
the whole mess slides into a wall of metal spikes.

190
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,403
The cases break open and what's left of the Flash is buried

191
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,324
alive in phony barf and then...

192
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,409
everything explodes!

193
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,454
You know what?

194
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,372
Taking turns is dumb.

195
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,541
Let's just all jump him at the museum.

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,669
- Brilliant. - Good deal.

197
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,339
But come on, it'll be great.

198
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,882
Okay, you don't like the Barf?

199
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,384
I can make do with 50,000 rotten eggs and a chain saw.

200
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,741
Well, if that's the way you're gonna be, forget about it!

201
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,226
I quit!

202
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,852
Nobody gets me.

203
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,401
This is where you live?

204
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,945
Isn't it great?

205
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,993
Low maintenance fees and there's a laundry room

206
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,698
on the same floor.

207
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,343
The way you talk, I would have thought

208
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,967
your Central City had built you a palace.

209
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:26,838
<i>You get a big burst of flavor in every bite.</i>

210
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,209
Dude, that was my last standy.

211
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,794
It... startled me.

212
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,846
Cool, huh?

213
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,349
The hard part is getting the costume back into it.

214
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,893
Take these attempts on your life more seriously.

215
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,064
What? Manure Master and Captain Koala?

216
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,273
No way.

217
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,900
Not just them.

218
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,944
Captain Cold and the Trickster.

219
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,488
That's four super criminals with an axe to grind.

220
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,257
If there were some way to hunt them down

221
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:06,076
we could eliminate these dogs before they strike again.

222
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,120
Look, I'll just round them all up tomorrow.

223
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,931
They all hang out at this little hole-in-the-wall

224
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,707
on fourth street.

225
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,108
My plan was solid.

226
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,069
I mean, what's so special about a disco of death?

227
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,821
Heck with all of 'em. I'm an artist.

228
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,573
They're just robbing banks.

229
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:47,993
Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang.

230
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,201
Probably would have gone for it if I was a captain.

231
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,667
Gotcha!

232
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,264
It's a snotgun.

233
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,932
Where are the others?

234
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,269
Those crabby hacks can go plug a hole for all I care

235
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,188
but I'm not about to rat 'em out.

236
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,814
Orion?

237
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,027
Talk...

238
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,695
while you still have a jaw.

239
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,197
Hey, hey!

240
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,491
Would you guys please take it down a notch.

241
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,034
Let me handle this.

242
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,747
James, you're off your meds, aren't you?

243
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:35,123
Better off without 'em.

244
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,417
Take 'em if I start feeling down.

245
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,961
You know that's not how the medicine works.

246
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,170
You're not well.

247
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,923
I'm fine.

248
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,424
You want to throw some darts?

249
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,510
No.

250
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,221
Listen, James, you're wearing the suit again.

251
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,639
I am?

252
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,682
Well, what do you know?

253
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,892
Here's the deal, buddy.

254
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,435
Tell me where those guys went

255
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,413
and I promise to come see you in the hospital.

256
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,064
We'll play darts.

257
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,690
The soft kind.

258
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,860
Okay. They're gonna ambush you at the Flash museum.

259
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,069
See?

260
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,072
That's all we needed.

261
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,698
Come on, we better get over there.

262
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,076
- What about your enemy? - Oh, right.

263
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:14,579
Dude, soon as you finish your drink, turn yourself in.

264
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,331
Got me again, Flash.

265
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,307
The Central Keystone area's beloved super hero, the Flash

266
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,477
is on hand for the opening of the new Flash museum.

267
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,189
When we come back, I'll try to get with him, get to him

268
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,983
for an interview.

269
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,191
Are we off?

270
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,986
Geez, he's a total babe.

271
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:48,238
Like, the entire track team at once.

272
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,127
I can't believe you're not into him, Marla.

273
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:52,242
<i>Okay, now, you're off.</i>

274
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,206
All clear on my end.

275
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,543
And I've removed every mirrored surface in the entire museum.

276
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,920
<i>To enter the building, they'd have to come through us.</i>

277
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,923
They'd be stupid to try.

278
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:12,179
Central City builds statues to this fool, who makes bad jokes

279
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:15,807
who concerns himself with pitiful men like the Trickster.

280
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,018
I don't understand.

281
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,145
No, you don't.

282
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,941
Flash, hi.

283
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,735
Over here. Evening news.

284
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:28,320
Uh-huh.

285
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:30,530
I'm going live again in about 50 seconds.

286
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,491
Can I get a few words from you then?

287
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,534
Huh? Uh, oh, sure.

288
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,411
Super. And, uh, here.

289
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,542
Oh. Thanks.

290
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,919
30 seconds, Linda.

291
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,587
Okay, let me touch up.

292
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,467
- Shh. - Ah!

293
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:51,675
Now!

294
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:55,764
Thanks, miss.

295
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,974
<i>We'll take it from here.</i>

296
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,364
If we aren't taking turns

297
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,491
let's at least see who hurts him the worst.

298
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,328
Better you than me.

299
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:42,936
Oh, Boomer, not the Turtleman display.

300
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,384
Hey, been looking for that.

301
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,808
You are <i>so</i> cleaning this place up.

302
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,017
Make me...

303
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,103
or rather, find me.

304
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,775
Nope, nope, nope.

305
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,404
There you are.

306
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,948
Time-out! Time-out!

307
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,618
Hang on, lady.

308
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,103
I've never seen so many stars.

309
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,521
Are we dead?

310
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,981
Those aren't stars.

311
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,667
They're millions and millions of mirrors.

312
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,051
We're trapped in another dimension.

313
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,573
Do you mind if I carry you?

314
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,866
Please.

315
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,204
- Did it work? - Kind of.

316
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,307
We know that isn't the mirror that takes us out of here.

317
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,249
We have to try them one at a time?

318
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,752
That could take years, even for you.

319
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,214
Where'd he go?

320
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:37,092
He's gone, lost forever in a mirror.

321
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,261
Time to seek the nearest exit.

322
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,554
That's it?

323
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,556
I was all set to crack some bones.

324
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>Then brace yourself.</i>

325
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,113
Let's make sure this one don't get up again.

326
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,446
Missed me.

327
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,080
Flash, look.

328
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,295
This will make my rep forever.

329
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:16,065
Gentlemen.

330
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,425
Are you sure that's all of the pieces?

331
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,094
<i>I demand a full accounting. Where's my lawyer?</i>

332
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,889
I know my rights, you obscene caricature of civil servant.

333
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,975
So, don't worry.

334
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,329
We took care of the bad guys and everything's okay now.

335
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,605
Flash, what about the new museum?

336
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,650
It got destroyed in the battle and it was our biggest shrine

337
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:03,988
to you, and you're our greatest hero, our greatest hope.

338
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,742
Well, at least I got to be on TV

339
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,786
and you know how much I like that.

340
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:15,250
Now, I understand.

341
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,294
You play the fool to hide a warrior's pain.

342
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:23,466
Dude, the bad guys went down and nobody got hurt.

343
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,677
You know what I call that?

344
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,554
A really good day.
