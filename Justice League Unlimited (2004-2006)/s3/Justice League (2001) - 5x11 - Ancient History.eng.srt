1
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,389
I like it. Very imaginative.

2
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,392
But your ring's useless against me, Lantern.

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,645
Then why are you running from it?

4
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,330
Mind the ion drive. That's delicate equipment.

5
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,668
Right. I took you lightly.

6
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,795
I won't make that mistake again.

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,757
I think you might...

8
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:57,515
if I were to give you another chance, I mean.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,566
He's all yours, GL

10
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:08,752
The Nth metal in this net...

11
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:10,027
Has properties that interfere

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,862
with dimensional shifting. I know.

13
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,408
Next time, Green Lantern, I'll do you proper!

14
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,118
Quiet down in there!

15
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,790
I've fought our gentleman ghost before.

16
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,434
These intangible types can be tricky.

17
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,876
Uh-huh.

18
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,421
But he didn't stand a chance against the two of us.

19
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:31,257
Look, Hawkman, I appreciate the help.

20
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,800
Let's leave it at that.

21
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,679
Well, give Shayera my regards.

22
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,889
You might wanna ease up a bit there.

23
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,142
Most guys don't really go for the ripped bulky look.

24
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,521
Just trying to maintain my girlish figure.

25
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:11,691
My girlish, girlish figure.

26
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,153
And why does it always have to be about the guys, anyway?

27
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,322
Honey, it's always about the guys

28
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,283
and since I'll be away on that photo shoot for a week...

29
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,576
Here we go.

30
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,953
Well, I'm just surprised

31
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,746
you haven't made your move before now.

32
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,289
<i>Still trying to figure out</i>

33
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,667
the proper Earth protocol for this situation.

34
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,336
It's not like I can just assassinate you in your sleep

35
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,090
or poison your water. I miss Thanagar.

36
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:39,051
I'm just saying, you think you got a shot, take it.

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
I'm not worried.

38
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,388
Mari, look, this isn't...

39
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,473
There you are.

40
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,933
Hey, stranger.

41
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,686
I was thinking, we could skip the concert tonight

42
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,354
just stay in and order take-out.

43
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,772
What do you say?

44
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,541
That'd be fine, Mari. Whatever you want.

45
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,110
Uh, I need to talk to Shayera for a sec.

46
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,613
Oh, uh, okay.

47
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,990
See you tonight, then.

48
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:03,784
Oh, Mari.

49
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,287
Thanks.

50
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,670
Really not worried.

51
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,090
I just ran into your stalker boyfriend, Carter Hall.

52
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,633
He's not my boyfriend.

53
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,886
And he's still talking about you.

54
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:26,390
Yeah, the whole reincarnated lovers from ancient Egypt bit.

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,768
Carter's just a little confused.

56
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:31,937
He's an obsessed fanboy with wings and an axe.

57
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,190
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were...

58
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:35,649
Concerned.

59
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,568
The guy's a serious creep.

60
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,069
I'm a big girl, John.

61
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,863
You know I can take care of myself.

62
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,532
Yeah, I just-just wanted to give you a heads up.

63
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,746
This isn't about us, Shayera.

64
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,130
The photo shoot runs a week in Milan

65
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,382
maybe another day in Rome.

66
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,345
Let me get that.

67
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,682
You can kiss, you can schlep.

68
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,643
I think men are just wonderful.

69
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,645
- I'll miss you. - You better.

70
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,261
Do you have time for breakfast?

71
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:16,565
The car's downstairs.

72
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,151
Just an English muffin. Perfect.

73
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,613
Sure you've got everything?

74
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,365
You can let the driver up for those.

75
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:25,991
I'll call you every day.

76
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Checking up on me?

77
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,994
Go finish your coffee.

78
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,515
Gotcha.

79
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,061
Get away!

80
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,646
This doesn't concern you!

81
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:00,734
What do you want with Vixen?

82
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,696
Guess again.

83
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:06,115
<i>And don't bother shining that bright light on me.</i>

84
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,741
Hasn't worked in months.

85
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:15,958
Mari, get down!

86
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,814
You just bought yourself a world of it, Shadow Thief!

87
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,036
Blackest night ends brightest day.

88
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:55,998
John!

89
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,708
Last warning, zoo candy.

90
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,752
This is between me and the Green Lantern

91
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,462
and that Thanagarian Harpy.

92
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,880
Stay out of it.

93
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:15,768
Shayera, he got John!

94
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:16,976
<i>What?</i>

95
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,103
<i>Vixen, what's happened?</i>

96
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,472
The Shadow Thief attacked us.

97
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,106
He took John.

98
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,818
And he said I was next?

99
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,279
Unless you know any other Thanagarian Harpies.

100
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,215
Anyway, I figured since your boyfriend here...

101
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,699
Not my boyfriend.

102
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,410
Since Hawkman's tangled with this guy before

103
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,120
he might be able to give us a lead...

104
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,569
What's wrong with this picture?

105
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,216
Hello?

106
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,096
Carter?

107
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:58,769
Did you hear that?

108
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,108
<i>Welcome, Shayera.</i>

109
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,158
We've been waiting for you.

110
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,419
Thank you for saving me the trouble of tracking you down.

111
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,353
I've got you, babe.

112
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,165
I warned you before to stay out of this.

113
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,876
See what happens to naughty girls?

114
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:06,211
Get away from her!

115
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,715
Hawkman.

116
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,633
The cast is complete.

117
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,029
You always were good with that thing.

118
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,237
Just hit him!

119
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,823
Right.

120
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,127
Rest easy, warrior.

121
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,977
<i>Of course you recognize the Absorbacron.</i>

122
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,855
Despite your best efforts to bury me alive

123
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,066
I managed to retrieve it.

124
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,274
Where is Vixen?

125
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,902
Out of the way.

126
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
She's not a part of this.

127
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,248
That machine is Thanagarian technology.

128
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,958
It's a telepathic database

129
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,626
more complex than anything on Earth

130
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,086
and it's broken.

131
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,504
She might be right.

132
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:33,048
When I touched it before, the feedback...

133
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,299
Hush now.

134
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,301
Watch and learn.

135
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:48,147
<i>Eight thousand years ago, two Thanagarian law officers</i>

136
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:51,108
<i>found themselves stranded on a primitive planet.</i>

137
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>This planet.</i>

138
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,195
<i>Katar and Shayera Hol</i>

139
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,323
<i>used their technology to make the desert bloom</i>

140
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,492
<i>and build the greatest city on Earth.</i>

141
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,662
<i>The people loved them</i>

142
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:14,590
<i>For decades, their ever-growing empire was a utopia.</i>

143
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:18,802
<i>But nothing lasts forever, at least, nothing good.</i>

144
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,263
Our armies are victorious, my liege.

145
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,432
They continue to bring the gifts' of Thanagar

146
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,975
to the rest of the world.

147
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,437
Hath Set, I wish to speak to my husband.

148
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,315
Alone.

149
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,233
As you wish, my queen.

150
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,656
What troubles you, Shayera?

151
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,034
Why ask what you already know?

152
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,410
I want to bear your child...

153
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,205
I don't want to have this conversation again.

154
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,748
Why the hurry?

155
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,958
You're a young woman. There's plenty of time.

156
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,710
Thirty or forty years at most.

157
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,795
I'm not a girl anymore.

158
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,548
You look the same as you did the day I met you.

159
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,966
<i>When my work is complete</i>

160
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,010
<i>after I've tamed this savage continent...</i>

161
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
You'll set out to conquer the rest of the world.

162
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,889
It's my duty.

163
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,777
We owe these people the peace and stability

164
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,559
that comes from Thanagarian rule.

165
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,228
I'm not arguing that

166
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,940
but you also have a duty to continue your bloodline

167
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,876
or are you so tired of me that you don't even...

168
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,318
I love you, Shayera Hol.

169
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:18,111
Nothing will ever change that.

170
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,400
It's just that right now, I need to concentrate on...

171
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,334
Hail, King Katar!

172
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,044
<i>Hail, Queen Shayera!</i>

173
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,926
Vashari, no need to stand on ceremony, my friend.

174
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:45,389
- What news do you bring? - Victory.

175
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,717
The land of Khandaq has been freed from Ahk-Ton's rule

176
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,102
and placed under your benevolent protection.

177
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,812
As tribute, Teth-Adam sends

178
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,481
one hundred of the finest stallions on Earth.

179
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,404
My husband and I travel on the winds, general.

180
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,489
What good are horses to us?

181
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,698
I'll show you.

182
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:10,580
I begin to see the worth of these beasts, Vashari.

183
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,542
I thought you might, milady, with the right company.

184
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,421
if you desire my company, you'll have to ride faster.

185
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,587
- Save some for me! - Hey!

186
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,547
Ha ha ha!

187
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,132
Ha ha ha!

188
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,633
I should have kept it for myself.

189
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,842
You're wasting it.

190
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,393
Katar's my husband.

191
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,395
And my best friend.

192
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,939
I'd leave him for you.

193
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,149
I'd never ask.

194
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,984
I'm afraid that you would.

195
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,235
Katar needs you.

196
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,862
And I need you.

197
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,219
It can't be true.

198
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,054
No, of course not.

199
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:52,265
Vashari would never betray your friendship in such a manner

200
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,686
and the queen's trustworthiness is of course beyond reproach.

201
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,939
Then, why pester me with idle gossip?

202
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,359
It's just that these ugly rumors undermine your authority

203
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,985
and I must admit...

204
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,030
No, I speak out of turn.

205
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,617
You speak when I command it, Hath Set.

206
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,078
They spend a great deal of time together.

207
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:16,373
They give the appearance of impropriety.

208
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:20,544
I trust Vashari with my life, and Shayera is my life.

209
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,671
I'll hear no more of this nonsense, Hath Set.

210
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,506
Leave me now!

211
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:26,425
As you say, my liege.

212
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,739
You didn't have to do that.

213
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,948
I can fly.

214
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,909
When we're together, so can I.

215
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,389
I wish they were dead.

216
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,533
What is it?

217
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,494
Answer me, woman!

218
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,211
No!

219
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,612
No.

220
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:22,749
Poison.

221
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,168
Just as you wished, my liege.

222
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,377
I didn't.

223
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,546
I never meant.

224
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,339
Get out.

225
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:32,133
My liege, I-I only...

226
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,010
I said get out!

227
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,142
Shayera.

228
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,545
Now you can let go.

229
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,965
You're Hath Set.

230
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:14,426
You're the one who poisoned us. I mean...

231
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:15,634
No, my queen.

232
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,054
I think Hawkman knows who I am.

233
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,434
I'm your darkest thoughts, your unspeakable desires.

234
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,604
- I'm you, Katar Hol. - No.

235
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,775
<i>When you first touched the Absorbacron</i>

236
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,571
<i>you freed me to do everything you wanted.</i>

237
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:39,034
<i>You wanted the secrets of Thanagarian technology.</i>

238
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:40,910
I found them for you.

239
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,495
You wanted to be a hero.

240
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,332
I became an arch villain for you to vanquish.

241
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,000
You want this woman...

242
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:49,961
I give her to you.

243
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,550
He's the only thing standing between you

244
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,179
and a love that spans 8000 years.

245
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,894
End it, Katar Hol. Take what you want.

246
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,992
Go, Katar, finish it.

247
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,205
Don't do it, Carter!

248
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,999
Shayera, you're all I've ever wanted.

249
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,419
But you'll never have her, not while he lives.

250
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,636
Had me worried there.

251
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,810
Weakling. Must I do everything for you?

252
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,116
My understanding is that this ring of yours

253
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,148
requires concentration.

254
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,953
You see, even now she runs to him.

255
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,538
Are you alright?

256
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,790
Hurts like crazy, but I'll live.

257
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:10,291
- Where's Mari? - Don't know.

258
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,710
I've gotta find her.

259
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,020
Who knows what that psycho might have...

260
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,714
We'll take care of shadow guy. Go.

261
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:29,893
Harlot!

262
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,187
What's wrong with you?

263
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,647
You should be with us.

264
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:47,787
It doesn't matter how many millennia you've been festering

265
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,541
I... will... conquer... you.

266
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,252
Carter! Carter, stop!

267
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:01,926
Shayera, I owe you an apology.

268
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,970
It's not the time, Carter.

269
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,639
No, it never was.

270
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,368
We weren't really meant for each other.

271
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,810
I have to accept that.

272
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,105
And I think we both know how the story is supposed to end.

273
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,118
Slight concussion, multiple fractures and lacerations.

274
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,163
Without her healing powers, it could have been worse.

275
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,083
Hey, cheer up, she's going to be fine.

276
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,214
Shayera, I haven't been fair to Mari

277
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:41,424
and I haven't been fair to you.

278
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,384
I couldn't figure out how to tell you this

279
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,595
or even if I should.

280
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,597
What?

281
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,891
When Batman and I went to the future

282
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,935
we met a man named Warhawk.

283
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,521
He's our son, yours and mine.

284
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,022
Our son?

285
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,650
That's why I've been so awkward around you lately.

286
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,528
I've been trying to figure out what to do with that knowledge

287
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:03,029
what it means for our future.

288
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,824
Well, what else could it mean?

289
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,700
I won't be destiny's puppet.

290
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,161
Whatever the future holds

291
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,080
we'll make those choices ourselves.

292
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,873
Don't say you don't love me.

293
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,460
I'll never say that, but you need to know...

294
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,254
I'm staying with Mari.

295
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,690
Tell me about my son.
