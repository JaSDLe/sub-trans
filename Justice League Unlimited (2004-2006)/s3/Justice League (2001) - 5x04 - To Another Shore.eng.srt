1
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,092
Looking good, Diana.

2
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,345
- Big date? - No such luck, Ollie.

3
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:20,306
I'm representing Themyscira at the global warming conference.

4
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,808
Way to go, man. Save the planet.

5
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,311
More like save my relationship with my mother.

6
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,104
Hey, at least you're speaking again.

7
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,749
It's the first thing she's asked me to do

8
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,274
since we mended fences.

9
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,401
I'd rather take another day trip to Tartarus.

10
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,446
I think you'll make a great diplomat.

11
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,906
Leave your sword.

12
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:40,034
I'm serious. I really don't want to go by myself.

13
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,495
J'onn, how about you come along and keep me company?

14
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:46,082
The Justice League currently has 23 active missions in progress.

15
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,918
Only I can properly deploy what remains of our resources.

16
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,837
Oh, please. Mr. Terrific can fill in.

17
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,446
He's smart enough to do monitor duty

18
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,591
and the Sunday Times crossword at the same time.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,594
Go ahead, J'onn. I'm already finished with the crossword.

20
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,471
You did it in ink again, didn't you?

21
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,348
Mr. Terrific is more than capable

22
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,642
but I insist on remaining where I'm needed.

23
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,894
Turn around and talk to me.

24
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,122
You've been cooped up like a hermit in the watchtower

25
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,439
for almost <i>two</i> years now.

26
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,899
I can better serve the League...

27
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,788
We're not even going to have that argument.

28
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,194
You're a super strong

29
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,905
nearly invulnerable, telepathic shape-changer.

30
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,217
The reason you aren't on the ground protecting humanity

31
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,368
is because you don't want to be.

32
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:26,080
You don't actually like humanity all that much, do you?

33
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,833
I don't... dislike them.

34
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,169
You're not the only newcomer to this world around here.

35
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,423
People have strange ways and take a lot of getting used to.

36
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:38,342
But it's worth the effort. They're worth it.

37
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,428
She's got your number, J'onn.

38
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,930
You need to mingle, maybe take a meal

39
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,699
in the commissary every once in a while.

40
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,517
My Martian physiology doesn't require

41
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,018
as many meals as a human.

42
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:52,648
You know what he means. You must be terribly lonely.

43
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,860
I've gotta go, but we're not done talking about this.

44
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,087
<i>Progress report, Mr. Luthor.</i>

45
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,840
<i>As promised, I've used various technologies to augment</i>

46
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,342
the powers of dozens of our associates.

47
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,262
I've had notable success with Atomic Skull.

48
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,474
- And Devil Ray? - Ready for action.

49
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:30,019
- I feel stronger than ever. - That's because you are.

50
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:32,107
The increased strength is the least of the gifts

51
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,064
I've granted you, your stingers...

52
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,858
Perfect timing, Lex.

53
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,836
I've got an assignment that's right up Devil Ray's

54
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,195
new and improved alley.

55
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:40,488
Where to?

56
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,948
First, I want to tell you a story.

57
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,411
<i>In Scandinavia, early in the tenth century</i>

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,288
<i>lived Prince John</i>

59
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,124
<i>the greatest warrior of his era.</i>

60
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,877
<i>His tremendous skill and valor brought him fame</i>

61
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:59,507
<i>throughout the world as the legendary Viking prince.</i>

62
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,676
<i>His adventures were epic, as were the legends that grew</i>

63
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,179
<i>around his exploits.</i>

64
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,389
<i>This much, we know to be truth.</i>

65
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,768
<i>On a frozen battlefield, Prince John, sole survivor</i>

66
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:14,313
<i>of a bloody war, its purpose lost to time</i>

67
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:18,108
<i>met a Valkyrie, a messenger from the Norse Gods</i>

68
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,610
<i>sent to escort the souls</i>

69
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,445
<i>of fallen heroes to their reward</i>

70
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,823
<i>in the halls of Valhalla.</i>

71
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,867
<i>Impossibly, they fell in love</i>

72
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,495
<i>and swore their hearts to each other.</i>

73
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,081
<i>But Odin, king of the Norse Gods</i>

74
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,208
<i>discovered their illicit affair</i>

75
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>and enraged, banished John from Valhalla.</i>

76
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,006
<i>The Viking prince pleaded with Odin for mercy</i>

77
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,884
<i>begging to be allowed to remain with his love.</i>

78
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,639
<i>Odin agreed, saying that if John died a heroic death</i>

79
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,226
<i>he and his love would again be united for all eternity.</i>

80
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:56,313
<i>But Odin was a crafty God and cruel.</i>

81
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,358
<i>Before exiling John, he gifted him with invulnerability</i>

82
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,404
<i>to harm from metal, wood, fire and water.</i>

83
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:04,947
<i>The Viking prince soon realized</i>

84
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,199
<i>that he would never die a hero's death</i>

85
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,910
<i>because no weapon on Earth could slay him.</i>

86
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,496
<i>He trod boldly across a troubled world</i>

87
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,291
<i>in search of adventure and an honorable death</i>

88
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:18,544
<i>growing ever more distant from humanity.</i>

89
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:21,422
<i>Eventually, weary of the endless fight</i>

90
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,258
<i>for justice and despairing in his loneliness</i>

91
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,010
<i>he sailed north</i>

92
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,512
<i>beyond the boundaries of the known world</i>

93
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,265
<i>and passed from the knowledge of man.</i>

94
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,730
That is, until now.

95
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,482
That Viking ship they found in a glacier last month.

96
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,359
You think it's his.

97
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,653
I <i>know</i> it is.

98
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,073
That's the standard of King Rick, his father.

99
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,035
The Viking prince is on that ship.

100
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,536
And?

101
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,997
I want you to steal his corpse.

102
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,498
You want me to reverse engineer

103
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,751
the secret of his invulnerability.

104
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,254
If we gained that power, all of us

105
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,215
we'd have nothing left to fear from the Justice League

106
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,594
and would be that much closer to achieving my ultimate goal.

107
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,889
Which, I note, you haven't seen fit to share with us.

108
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:14,808
Patience, my friends.

109
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,061
The grandest prizes are worth the wait.

110
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,945
<i>The proposed accords are far too drastic.</i>

111
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,072
<i>With all due respect, princess</i>

112
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,075
we're talking about committing hundreds of billions of dollars

113
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,827
and nobody's even proven the existence of global warming.

114
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,080
My mother's government fully supports the findings

115
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,332
of her scientists and those of the vast majority

116
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,250
of scientists here in man's world.

117
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,628
My government does not accept those studies.

118
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,672
Then, accept the evidence of your eyes.

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,966
There's a Viking ship at the bottom of this mountain

120
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,176
hidden in ice for 1100 years.

121
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,625
If it weren't for global warming

122
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,821
we wouldn't even know about it.

123
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,806
Yes, and it was clever PR

124
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:58,018
for our host to hold the talks here, but it is not proof.

125
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,062
You have to take this seriously.

126
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,647
Atlantis has already withdrawn

127
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,482
from the World Assembly over this

128
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,859
and they aren't the only country considering action.

129
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,529
Are you suggesting Themyscira might do the same?

130
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,281
If your pollution continues to affect my home

131
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,890
my mother is less likely to withdraw

132
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,910
than she is to attempt a military solution.

133
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,627
As a last resort only of course.

134
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,254
Excuse me.

135
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,478
Agent Faraday, what are you doing here?

136
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,316
- Not smoking. Want some? - No, thanks.

137
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,152
I'm here with the special security team.

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,196
The vice president is attending, but you know that already.

139
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,116
I saw you reading him the riot act earlier.

140
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,617
I'm not much of a diplomat.

141
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,661
Don't sell yourself short, lady.

142
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,122
You're an international incident waiting to happen.

143
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:04,793
By the way, if you raise your voice to the VP again

144
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,337
my men are under orders to shoot you.

145
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,919
Smack

146
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,009
You did not just shoot at me.

147
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,107
You have to stop.

148
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,984
If you pull that ship free, half the mountain's gonna come down.

149
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,319
So?

150
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,155
So I'm not going to let you do it.

151
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,074
Out of my way, Jumbo.

152
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,286
That hurt.

153
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,215
Cheater. You're cheating.

154
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,735
It's a poison stinger, sweetheart.

155
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,863
It'll kill you, eventually

156
00:10:56,071 --> 00:11:00,325
slowly, painfully, but today's your lucky day.

157
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,537
<i>I'm gonna put you out of your misery right now.</i>

158
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,926
Move it, you goldbricking yahoos! Pour it on!

159
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,310
- You okay? - Arm's numb.

160
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,520
Stomach's not all that great either.

161
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,689
Easy, princess. Let me look at that.

162
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,193
Stinger's still in there.

163
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,445
- Pull it out. - There's a barb.

164
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,923
If you want a bullet to bite, there's plenty lying around.

165
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,116
Now. Uh!

166
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:43,869
That's all. It's out.

167
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,913
Then, let's take them down.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,090
<i>You are a <i>beautiful</i> man.</i>

169
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,303
I think I'll keep you.

170
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,151
We should retreat.

171
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,694
I'm not backing down from a fight.

172
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,321
Your bloodstream's full of poison.

173
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,169
I can't believe you're still on your feet.

174
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,481
It's only a matter of time until your system shuts down.

175
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,873
I guess calling for support isn't backing down.

176
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,082
I gotta say it ain't.

177
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,671
<i>J'onn, I've got a situation.</i>

178
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,190
Watchtower sensors have picked up the Earth tremors

179
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,674
from your location.

180
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,282
I knew you were on the scene and assumed you could handle it.

181
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:44,179
<i>Well, I can't. I'm outnumbered and I'm not feeling well.</i>

182
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,681
We're still shorthanded.

183
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,975
I could spare Green Arrow and Mr. Terrific.

184
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,477
<i>Bring who you want, J'onn, but I need you!</i>

185
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:57,818
Well, that bites.

186
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,409
What's the matter, honey, break a nail?

187
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,495
<i>- Green Arrow?</i> - And I brought company.

188
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,788
Smack

189
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:32,019
And Black Canary said a buzz-saw arrow was <i>self-indulgent.</i>

190
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,908
They've had every opportunity to escape, but they keep fighting.

191
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,869
<i>What makes that ancient vessel so important?</i>

192
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,787
if I can get my lasso around one of them

193
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,372
I can make them tell.

194
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,542
Good idea, but save your strength.

195
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,754
<i>He gifted him with invulnerability to harm.</i>

196
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,346
Close enough.

197
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,473
J'onn, what happened? Are you okay?

198
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,767
Didn't get it all, but we can't allow them

199
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,352
to take that ship, they...

200
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,776
Fire.

201
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,174
You're a sight for sore eyes.

202
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,218
Not to say that ain't always the case.

203
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,390
Oh, what's happening?

204
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,832
♪ Da da da ♪

205
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,708
♪ Da da da ♪

206
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,215
Hey, buddy!

207
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:17,684
What are you doing in here?

208
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,147
Well, for one thing, it's freezing outside.

209
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:36,368
You're coming with me.

210
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,663
Hey, watch the hands.

211
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,628
This is just too good to be true.

212
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,596
Let me give you a hint.

213
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:58,558
You want to try holding your breath as long as you can.

214
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:33,051
Let me <i>go,</i> freak, or so help me, I'll give you frostbite

215
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,220
in places you didn't even know you <i>had</i> places!

216
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,763
Use your powers.

217
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,558
Stop the avalanche or all the people inside will die.

218
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,059
Why should I care?

219
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,644
When it hits, I intend to see

220
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,813
that we're both standing right here.

221
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,581
I don't even know if I'm powerful enough

222
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,233
to stop a whole avalanche!

223
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,318
Let's find out, shall we?

224
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,445
if you move, we're gonna have to mop the floor.

225
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,915
- You've done well. - Kiss my frosty butt.

226
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,918
I don't suppose you boys want to talk about this?

227
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,048
That's probably for me.

228
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,010
<i>Attention unidentified craft.</i>

229
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,179
<i>This is Special Agent King Faraday</i>

230
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>Your vessel is currently surrounded</i>

231
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:05,685
by three United States navy sea wolf-class submarines.

232
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,104
While I strongly suggest you surrender immediately

233
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,689
and prepare to be boarded

234
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,941
I really enjoy firing trident missiles

235
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,236
at tiny little subs, so the decision's entirely up to you.

236
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,714
- How's the shoulder, Diana? - Better.

237
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,342
The anti-toxin I found in Devil Ray's belt did the trick.

238
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,511
I still don't get what all this was about.

239
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,262
They think the Viking prince's corpse

240
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,390
will give them the secret of invulnerability.

241
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:46,518
That was their plan or as much of it as I could learn

242
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:49,187
before something shut down Giganta's mind.

243
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,064
Green Lantern said the same thing happened

244
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:52,649
when he tried to question Metallo.

245
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,068
So these guys were working with Metallo?

246
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,903
And perhaps with others.

247
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,905
We can't leave Prince John's body here.

248
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,491
Whoever else is involved will just try again.

249
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,869
The legend of the Viking prince is known even to my people.

250
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,956
If this is really him, he deserves to be laid to rest

251
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,041
according to tradition.

252
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,168
I'll take care of it.

253
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,546
Meanwhile, something's definitely not kosher.

254
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:18,007
Strange thefts, super villains with their heads hotwired

255
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,884
to short out if you question them.

256
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,928
We've got a real mystery developing here.

257
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,849
True, but it's a mystery you'll have to solve without me.

258
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,769
I've been thinking about what you said

259
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:33,189
and about the horrible despair of Prince John's life.

260
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,568
I'm a Martian. I'll live far longer than he did.

261
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,529
<i>And unless I find a way to connect with humanity</i>

262
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,532
I'll live out that time totally alone.

263
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,827
I can't learn what I <i>need </i>to learn on the watchtower.

264
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:57,088
And now, all in my own countree, I stood on the firm land.

265
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,299
<i>The Hermit stepped forth from the boat</i>

266
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:03,011
<i>and scarcely he could stand.</i>

267
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,805
<i>"Oh, shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man."</i>

268
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,849
<i>The Hermit crossed his brow.</i>

269
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,352
<i>"Say quick," quoth he.</i>

270
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,980
<i>"I bid thee say, what manner of man art thou?"</i>

271
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:18,443
<i>Forthwith this frame of mind</i>

272
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:21,946
<i>was wrenched with a woeful agony</i>

273
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:26,159
<i>which forced me to begin my tale and then it left me free.</i>

274
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,044
<i>Since then, at an uncertain hour, that agony returns.</i>

275
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,507
And till my ghastly tale is told

276
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,550
this heart within me burns.

277
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,806
<i>I pass, like night, from land to land.</i>

278
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,726
<i>I have strange power of speech.</i>

279
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,273
<i>That moment that his face I see</i>

280
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,860
<i>I know the man that must hear me.</i>

281
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,029
<i>To him my tale I teach.</i>
