1
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,883
Brainiac, you're in there.

2
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,260
I can almost feel you.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:16,390
Abasing myself before Grodd then running this unwieldy super gang

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,226
it's all been worth it if I can just free

5
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,311
the only piece of you that remains.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,231
Lex, don't talk to the rock.

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,274
Stay out of this, witch.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,785
It makes no sense.

9
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,286
The smallest scrap of Brainiac

10
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,413
should be sufficient to reconstitute him.

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,374
Don't worry, darling I'm sure it will be...

12
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:44,335
Unless Grodd is somehow preventing it.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,800
What do you want, Luthor?

14
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,052
How do I unlock the Brainiac code?

15
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,763
You're a genius, figure it out.

16
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,933
Tell me, you leering, manipulative, knuckle dragger...

17
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,769
Oh, Lex, Lex.

18
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,106
You can't expect me to give up my only bargaining chip.

19
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:07,024
What's in it for me?

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,362
When this is over, I'm going to sell your body for dog meat.

21
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,990
It must pain you to see me like this

22
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,200
after what we've been to one another.

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,829
My taste in boyfriends has evolved.

24
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,331
Wait, Lex.

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,874
You're the leader now.

26
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,835
You don't need to lock horns with him.

27
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,063
The only thing that matters now is a speck of information

28
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,340
locked somewhere deep inside Grodd's thick skull.

29
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,926
Yes, okay.

30
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,929
So we break his head open and take it.

31
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,488
We don't think you've got what it takes to run the show.

32
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,875
You've been acting unbalanced

33
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,294
holed up in that lab, talking to yourself.

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,922
After Grodd tried to turn the world into apes

35
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,217
you can imagine how seriously we'd take something like that.

36
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,803
What are you going to do, make everybody bald?

37
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,721
Maybe it's time for younger, smarter

38
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,223
more aggressive leadership.

39
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,350
- Really? - Yeah.

40
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,143
Why should any of us follow you?

41
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,146
Because I'll show you how to make more money in one day

42
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,149
than you've made in your entire lives.

43
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,903
Look, we know Grodd's running some kind of organized group.

44
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,114
I'm tired of just putting out fires.

45
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,116
We need to find his new secret society

46
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,909
and take the fight to them.

47
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,202
Guys, I'm not arguing that

48
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,638
there's just got to be another way.

49
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,662
This is it.

50
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,789
When Grodd took control

51
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,666
of your mind a couple of years ago

52
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,168
even though that connection was broken

53
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,003
he left a psychic resonance.

54
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,132
I can mystically access that resonance and trace it to Grodd

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,425
wherever he hides.

56
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,051
And when we do find Grodd

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,054
we'll likely find Luthor, Bizarro, and any number

58
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,681
of wanted criminals.

59
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:44,974
No doubt, but I don't like

60
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,017
strangers nosing around in my brain.

61
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,226
No offense, doc.

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,395
I assure you, I won't

63
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,938
be reading your thoughts.

64
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,940
Your mind is simply a portal.

65
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,234
This really seems like it's more up J'onn's alley.

66
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,819
J'onn's not here.

67
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,697
What do you say we go check with Batman? He's got clues.

68
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,449
You saw Batman's report.

69
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,200
Grodd covered all of his tracks.

70
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,163
We need to find him before he hurts anyone else, Flash.

71
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,998
This may be our only shot.

72
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:12,293
Man, just be careful with my head.

73
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,128
That's where I keep all my one-liners.

74
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,550
Show me the mind of gorilla Grodd.

75
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,051
<i>You see how much I've learned</i>

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,596
<i>from your mind control technology.</i>

77
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:27,057
Of course, I don't have your natural talent for the work.

78
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,311
So my process is relatively crude.

79
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,105
Last chance, tell me what I want to know

80
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,484
or I'll tear the information from your bleeding frontal lobe.

81
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,986
You're a technological creep

82
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,615
a sadistic child playing with power tools.

83
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:43,991
Do it.

84
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,873
My spell has already found a trace

85
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,167
of Grodd's mental signature.

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,796
It should be a simple matter to follow it back to the source.

87
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,486
- Wally! - No, something is wrong.

88
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:23,656
That's not Flash's mind, it's Lex Luthor!

89
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,866
- What? - What have you done to me?

90
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,868
That's Luthor.

91
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,081
Huh!

92
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,382
Beam me out of here or I'm going to vibrate these fingers

93
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,634
and scramble your brains.

94
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,177
Do as he says, Tony.

95
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,346
We can't let Luthor get away with Flash's body.

96
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,390
He'll be unstoppable.

97
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,019
Yeah, I know.

98
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,779
If Luthor's mind is in Flash's body, where's Flash?

99
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,411
Lex?

100
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:13,706
Whoa.

101
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,504
You guys just stay back.

102
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,381
Hey, what happened to my voice?

103
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,134
He's cooked his own brain.

104
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:37,438
Okay, something's really wrong here.

105
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,733
Lex? You don't look at all well.

106
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,027
Yeah, I'm just a little winded.

107
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,070
Did you say Lex?

108
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,989
Psycho.

109
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,702
Attention all decks, this is a station wide alert.

110
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,079
Lex Luthor has control of Flash's body.

111
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,083
Contain him at any cost, use whatever force is necessary.

112
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,418
I don't want him hurt.

113
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,003
That's not the problem.

114
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,258
I've tracked Flash's comlink and ID badge

115
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,218
it looks like he's hiding in a storage room.

116
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,179
- Come on! - Just you and Fate.

117
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,264
There's something weird about this.

118
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,058
Fine.

119
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,791
- Yeah, it was a trick. - It figures.

120
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,627
I've sent extra muscle to the backup teleport pads, GL

121
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:44,338
<i>You and Red Tornado cover the Javelin Bay.</i>

122
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,966
I must sequester myself and compile a new spell

123
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,968
to reverse this mind switch.

124
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,184
Lex!

125
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,395
Uh, how's it going?

126
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:02,648
My darling, this is no time to show weakness.

127
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:05,150
- The wolf is at the door. - Uh-huh.

128
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,654
Dr. Polaris is this far from open revolt.

129
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,364
He's treacherous.

130
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:14,451
I want to punish him, baby so very badly.

131
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,746
Right, sure.

132
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,916
Uh, just one question, do I know you?

133
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,003
You need to rest.

134
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,611
You need to stop following me around

135
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:27,673
so that I can think for a second.

136
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,802
Okay, okay.

137
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,931
I'm trapped in a building full of super villains.

138
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,531
I've lost my powers, and for some reason

139
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,559
this creepy hot chick thinks I'm...

140
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,602
Lex Luthor.

141
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,481
Oh, that is just wrong.

142
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,690
Cripes.

143
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,733
This is life or death

144
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,193
I'd better call for backup.

145
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:50,988
Duh.

146
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,663
<i>Lex, are you alright?</i>

147
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,123
I'm fine.

148
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,834
No service. Man!

149
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,629
Are we doing this, or what?

150
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,049
I told him you want to be alone.

151
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:13,302
We're supposed to be going over your big plan.

152
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,429
We are still pulling the job, right?

153
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,222
Or was the whole thing just a bluff?

154
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,224
Huh? I mean...

155
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,018
Right, the big plan.

156
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,062
I'm all over the big plan.

157
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,272
So let's... go do that.

158
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,026
What?

159
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,278
You gonna wash your hands?

160
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,988
No.

161
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,782
<i>Cause I'm evil.</i>

162
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:44,875
Give it up, Luthor.

163
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,635
Get down!

164
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,435
His vibrations create an unstable resonance.

165
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,646
Which is why the real Flash doesn't do it.

166
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,444
Luthor, the bay's locked down, those doors won't open.

167
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,905
Just watch.

168
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,616
The weapons won't fire inside the Javelin Bay.

169
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,493
It's a safety feature.

170
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:20,953
Wonderful.

171
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,393
Continue, GL I can counter this.

172
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,655
Talk to the crew, Lex. You remind them who's boss.

173
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,162
We're waiting, Luthor.

174
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,915
My fellow bad guys.

175
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:12,921
I, Lex Luthor, your leader, will speak now about my...

176
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,048
Lex Luthor's plan.

177
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,260
My... villainous, villainous plan.

178
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,762
Question the plan at your peril.

179
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:25,225
Uh, any questions?

180
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,102
We all get a cut, right?

181
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,354
Watch your step, my evil minion.

182
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,106
You presume too much.

183
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,067
One of these days, you'll go too far.

184
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,989
- Me got answer. - Excellent.

185
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,741
Do enlighten us.

186
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,160
Ever since you plug into monkey's head

187
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:46,288
you act perfectly sane and rational.

188
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:49,082
Am you Bizarro's mommy?

189
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,502
<i>- What is his problem? - Come on!</i>

190
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,922
Wait. I got it!

191
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,925
- You, uh, evil head guy. - Yeah?

192
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,844
Tell me your part in this plan.

193
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,513
I don't have a part in this plan.

194
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,182
Exactly.

195
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,852
Pop quiz, everyone tell me their part in the plan.

196
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,689
Well, here's the way you gave it to us, this morning.

197
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,235
<i>The recently reunited country of Kashnia has gone democratic</i>

198
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,278
<i>and is joining the European Union.</i>

199
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,323
As such, they're switching their currency

200
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:24,493
from Kashnia crowns to euros.

201
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,662
<i>In a few hours, nearly 100 million newly minted</i>

202
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,665
<i>euros are being brought into the Kashnian treasury.</i>

203
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:32,960
So, while Dr. Polaris and Sinestro take the point

204
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,672
darling, you and I are in the transport nearby.

205
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,800
It's a simple smash and grab, it's also gonna be

206
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,678
the largest single robbery in history.

207
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:47,683
Whoa! I mean, Lex Luthor is pleased, carry on.

208
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,772
Really, he's in terrific shape.

209
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,192
He only needs a little downtime before heist.

210
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,450
Rest in here, darling.

211
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,455
<i>Hey... that's not restful.</i>

212
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,879
Lex, you're having a difficult day.

213
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,302
Hmm, if nothing else, I can at least learn

214
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,679
the Flash's secret identity.

215
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,641
I have no idea who this is.

216
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,729
Baby, you are so different.

217
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,940
So attentive, so caring

218
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,860
so... enthusiastic.

219
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,447
I like it.

220
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,034
Hey, communications room.

221
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,786
I need to make a quick call, won't be a moment.

222
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,538
The transport's fueled.

223
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,291
Come on, Luthor, before they move the money.

224
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,793
Mr. Luthor, sir, it's Grodd.

225
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,879
He's recovered and he wants to talk to you.

226
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,048
Man, what now?

227
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,635
Can you wait outside?

228
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,515
You better not be wasting Luthor's time, Grodd.

229
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,725
What is it?

230
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,728
I just had to see it for myself

231
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,772
<i>Flash.</i>

232
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,530
Me? The flash?

233
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,367
You've, like, totally lost it, Grodd.

234
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:29,743
I'm Lex Luthor.

235
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:33,580
And I'm Charlton Heston, dolt.

236
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,917
My brain was in the circuit when you and Luthor traded minds.

237
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,128
Okay, look.

238
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,464
Luthor's got you in a cage like a lab rat.

239
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:45,300
He's humiliated you, you hate him.

240
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,677
And you can help me see to it he never comes back.

241
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,097
Dude, help me out here.

242
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,016
True, I do hate Luthor...

243
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,685
but I hate you just as much.

244
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:59,022
So... you gonna bust me or what?

245
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,274
Where's the fun in that?

246
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,443
I'm going to watch you twist in the wind

247
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,154
<i>until you're discovered and they tear you</i>

248
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,115
<i>limb from limb.</i>

249
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,159
Lex, we really have to go.

250
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,912
<i>Ahh, Tala, my old groupie.</i>

251
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,581
I so miss bending you to my will.

252
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,417
Go eat a banana.

253
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,919
Lex is my man now.

254
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,629
If you say so.

255
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,924
I have devised a spell to exchange Luthor and Flash's

256
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,219
minds again but to properly execute it I must have physical

257
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,221
contact with at least one of them.

258
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,932
They've got the fake Flash cornered in the cafeteria.

259
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,184
<i>Go get him, Fate.</i>

260
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,736
There's our target.

261
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,041
Luthor, we're waiting for your order.

262
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,585
Go.

263
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,516
Hah, sitting ducks.

264
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,020
We're behind schedule, a little help?

265
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,203
Don't worry, guys, nobody is gonna hurt you.

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,080
Unless you try something.

267
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,833
Sir, headquarters is forwarding a priority

268
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,543
radio message.

269
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,756
Attention, the man you think is Luthor

270
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,217
is actually a Justice Leaguer disguised as me.

271
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,761
<i>Repeat, he is not Luthor.</i>

272
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,392
I, Lex Luthor...

273
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,561
find that preposterous.

274
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,731
Tell you what, why don't you humor us and tell me something

275
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,942
Luthor would know and a spy wouldn't.

276
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,861
What's my real name?

277
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:40,702
Priority override, user code 006... uh!

278
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,495
We better hurry and finish loading

279
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,332
it won't take the league long to track that transmission.

280
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,168
Flash! Flash, come in!

281
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:50,962
Metro tower, what can we do for you, Mr. Terrific?

282
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,632
Send the team to the following coordinates.

283
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,386
He did it again.

284
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,764
It's a decoy.

285
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,265
Why would he even bother?

286
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,180
He's on the bridge, he's...

287
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,696
Picking up traces of hard light radiation

288
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,905
but it's pretty faint.

289
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:19,407
Allow me.

290
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,845
Tala, open a portal.

291
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,187
Forget the money.

292
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,050
<i>Teleportation control online.</i>

293
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:24,431
<i>Artificial gravity off.</i>

294
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,896
Speed's no good without gravity.

295
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,191
That's where you're wrong.

296
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,652
<i>Artificial gravity on.</i>

297
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,033
Dr. Fate, your patient just anesthetized himself.

298
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,501
Guys!

299
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,604
I was starting to think I was

300
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:56,668
gonna go out as the bottom

301
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,089
of a super villain dog pile.

302
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,217
It sounds like Wally, but is there any way to be sure?

303
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,510
You want proof?

304
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,039
Until he went off into the marines

305
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,513
GL's nickname was...

306
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,682
Stop! It's him.

307
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,018
And you promised never to repeat that story.

308
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:12,270
I know, I was just messing with your head.

309
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,064
Well can you tell us anything about Grodd's secret society?

310
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,775
<i>Where's their headquarters?</i>

311
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,027
I don't know, in a swamp?

312
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,988
You're making a big mistake.

313
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,241
Got to be the Martian.

314
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,745
I say we torture him until he reverts to his true form.

315
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,206
It's me, Luthor.

316
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,750
Dr. Fate switched my mind, but I'm back now.

317
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,169
It <i>may</i> be true.

318
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:39,631
That doesn't matter, I'm running things from now on.

319
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,592
Oh, don't kid yourself, Polaris.

320
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,428
Whether you're just a look-alike or the real thing

321
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,472
I'd hate to be you about now.

322
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,369
That's how you know I'm Luthor.

323
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,913
When I augmented your powers, I also made sure I could

324
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,915
override your abilities.

325
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:16,376
Would anyone else care to try me?

326
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,634
Lex, is that really you?

327
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
Of course it's me, you twit.
