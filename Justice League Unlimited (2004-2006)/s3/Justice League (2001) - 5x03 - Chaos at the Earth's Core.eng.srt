1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,354
Trap's all set.

2
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,611
Eat my sparkles, turtle.

3
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:38,454
Wait for GL, Star Girl!

4
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,997
<i>You'll give yourself a hernia.</i>

5
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,499
I got him, Pat.

6
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,257
Anytime, Lantern!

7
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,594
Stall it, S.T.R.I.P.E. I'll be right there.

8
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,096
Stall it, he says.

9
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:15,449
He's almost in position.

10
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,658
On my signal...

11
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,619
As if. Big boy's mine.

12
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,828
Courtney!

13
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,196
<i>Arigato.</i> Thank you.

14
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,405
<i>Arigato.</i>

15
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,366
<i>Arigato. Arigato.</i>

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,076
How'd she get here anyway?

17
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,544
What's with all the wannabes?

18
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,087
Probably here for the convention.

19
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,380
Convention?

20
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,429
When we get back to the Metro Tower

21
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,307
you and I are going to have a talk about grandstanding.

22
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,477
Tell that to her. The little showoff stole my thunder.

23
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,606
Don't you talk about Supergirl!

24
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,941
Supergirl can melt you with her eyes!

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,150
Big whoop.

26
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,862
My stepdad here is a mecha.

27
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,032
Mecha so last year.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,076
She's very big in Japan.

29
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,331
Why can't we just fly straight home?

30
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,043
Over the North Pole is the straightest route... rookie.

31
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,214
She's always blah blah blah my cousin.

32
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:55,883
Blah blah blah blah my cousin.

33
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,760
Like we don't know who she means.

34
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:01,222
Check me out. I'm Supergirl.

35
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,183
Ask me, the only thing that matters is we all pull through.

36
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,769
Shut up, Pat. It wasn't World War III.

37
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:08,729
It was a giant turtle.

38
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,481
If I was you, I wouldn't talk

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,943
behind somebody's back when they got super hearing.

40
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,491
- Kara, easy on the yoke! - I'm not doing anything!

41
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,243
- Watchtower! - Watchtower!

42
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,578
Be my guest.

43
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,663
J'onn, it's Kara.

44
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,623
- Nothing. - Hmm.

45
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,512
My ring says we're still at the North Pole.

46
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,919
Maybe somebody's North Pole.

47
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,911
So where the heck are we?

48
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,789
I can only guess we're <i>way, way</i> underground.

49
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,666
And the exit would be...

50
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,175
- Through them. - Not a problem.

51
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,353
You guys! My powers aren't working.

52
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,021
Aw.

53
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,983
I'm serious. I'm at, like, half strength, maybe less.

54
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,673
Oh, damn!

55
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,593
Heads up!

56
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,770
Cover Supergirl!

57
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,030
What are you waiting for?

58
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,615
Zap 'em with your star thingy!

59
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,283
Oh, may I?

60
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,760
<i>Cause it would be such an honor to help</i>

61
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,703
<i>the great Supergirl out of a jam.</i>

62
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,954
Come on!

63
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,880
You are so loving this.

64
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,432
Scan the area.

65
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:16,310
Yep, that's the last of 'em.

66
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:17,603
Oh, wait.

67
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,407
Travis Morgan, warlord of Shambala.

68
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,076
Been expecting you.

69
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,459
Welcome to Skartaris.

70
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,252
Sorry I can't put out more of a spread.

71
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,588
Times are tough.

72
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,675
Morgan, I don't believe you brought us here just to feed us.

73
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,635
We are in dire need.

74
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,428
My daughter, Jennifer.

75
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,764
Our world must have champions.

76
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,516
I used my magic to reach out

77
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,524
and bring you here to the center of the Earth.

78
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,563
And I'd call the whole thing a load of crab cakes

79
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,188
if I wasn't here to see it.

80
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,649
And even seeing it, I still ain't a hundred percent.

81
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,777
If you want something to believe in, come on.

82
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,202
Geez. You call that an army?

83
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,996
Most of these folks have lost everything

84
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:20,332
to Demos, so you know, feel free to dump on them.

85
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,541
What I meant was...

86
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,827
She means we'll do everything

87
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,128
we can to help.

88
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,506
Tell us about Demos.

89
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,717
Yeah, nasty wizard.

90
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,177
Those were his Dinotroopers you met.

91
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,546
He used to try and shake down a kingdom here and there.

92
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,974
But a few months ago, he started this big push

93
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,225
to take over the world.

94
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,768
And that was about the same time

95
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,645
he discovered energy weapons.

96
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,772
All of a sudden, the wizard's gone hi-tech.

97
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,357
Somebody's supplying him.

98
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,817
Back when I was in the air force

99
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,736
that energy stuff was science fiction.

100
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:52,281
That explains why Morgan the barbarian packs an auto-mag.

101
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:55,117
Came through the portal and made myself at home.

102
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,827
Look around you.

103
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,414
<i>These are some of the last free people in Skartaris.</i>

104
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:03,917
Demos has us pinned between his army and the great stone.

105
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,211
I'll bite. What great stone?

106
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,921
The monks keep it in a tabernacle

107
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,590
deep inside the mountain.

108
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,634
They say it's got magic properties.

109
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,678
Demos wants it... bad.

110
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,776
Lord Demos, the alien force escaped us.

111
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,279
Describe them.

112
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,157
My Lord, it happened so fast.

113
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,369
How many were there?

114
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,871
Did they have weapons?

115
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,374
<i>Did they address each other by name?</i>

116
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,340
One wore a coat of arms!

117
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,189
Well...

118
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,608
you're my military advisors.

119
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,486
Do you recognize this crest?

120
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:15,405
Yes, I know it well.

121
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,799
- Morgan. - Machiste.

122
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,971
Best guy I know. King of Kiro.

123
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,598
Machiste knows as much about the great stone as anybody.

124
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,601
Machiste, this is Green Lantern.

125
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,271
Hey.

126
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,314
When the blood death came upon me

127
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,858
my case seemed hopeless...

128
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,901
until the monks of the tabernacle placed me

129
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,405
before the great stone and let me bathe in its rays.

130
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:59,324
- It's a curative? - Only for the most desperate.

131
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,536
It can cure or kill.

132
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,622
And Demos isn't the healing type.

133
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,999
Behold!

134
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,920
The great stone!

135
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,186
You okay?

136
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,062
I've never seen a piece of Kryptonite

137
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,565
that big before.

138
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:34,735
If this place wasn't messing with my powers...

139
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,612
I'd be dead already.

140
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,330
- Shakera! - Oh!

141
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,625
Demos is here.

142
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,168
It's the end.

143
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,782
For Skartaris!

144
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,595
Let's get this done.

145
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,804
Supergirl, you stay...

146
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,098
- Yah! - Fine.

147
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,373
Not coming off.

148
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,916
Silver Banshee.

149
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:37,376
How the heck did you get...

150
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,870
Tell the outworlder to come get his rock.

151
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,919
You need a new plan.

152
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,006
My magic is strongest, girl.

153
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,726
Your breath is strongest, dude.

154
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,061
That's about it.

155
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,108
Such a pretty child.

156
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,361
But then they're always pretty when I begin.

157
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,946
Demos!

158
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,032
You and me, pal.

159
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,743
Morgan, I was hoping to kill you today.

160
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,189
Touch it and you're tinfoil.

161
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:28,195
At this distance, the Kryptonite cell that powers me

162
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,739
would bring your cousin to his knees.

163
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,575
I'm immune to Kryptonite, metal mouth.

164
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:34,783
Give up!

165
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,958
if you're immune, love, why do you need that staff?

166
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:05,190
You filthy brat! Where are you?

167
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,370
Ha ha ha.

168
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,955
You think you've won?

169
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:05,917
No freedom-loving warlord will ever unite the lands

170
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,004
and bring peace, justice.

171
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,172
A foolish dream.

172
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:17,012
Maybe so, wizard, but it's the one dream worth fighting for.

173
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,978
You lied, little one.

174
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,023
<i>I can see the illness creeping over you.</i>

175
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,075
You have none of Superman's strength.

176
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,077
But I got brains.

177
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,589
I can't move without my Kryptonite battery.

178
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,424
But it's killing you.

179
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,885
I won't quit.

180
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,345
You don't have to.

181
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,238
Will there ever be another time such as ours?

182
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:01,741
The Great Stone is safe!

183
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,706
Demos is defeated!

184
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:18,216
Now and forever, Skartaris is free!

185
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:28,768
John Corbin alias Metallo.

186
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,521
Fancy meeting you here in the center of the Earth.

187
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,317
Muling Kryptonite with Silver Banshee.

188
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,670
You could pretty much run forever

189
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,112
on this one little chunk.

190
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,449
And without it, what do you have?

191
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:46,911
<i>Fifteen minutes of reserve power? Ten?</i>

192
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,457
Tell me, why do you want so much?

193
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,417
There's enough in that tabernacle to satisfy

194
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,043
a 100 Superman haters.

195
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,712
There's a scary thought.

196
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,548
You won't get anything out of me.

197
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,384
Pretty soon, you aren't gonna have the breath to talk.

198
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,263
Who knows, five minutes? One?

199
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,055
Alright.

200
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,933
I joined forces with...

201
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,605
Whoa, Nelly!

202
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:15,398
This isn't Silver Banshee's work.

203
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,859
Somebody else didn't want Metallo to give them up.

204
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,945
You'll take that thing with you.

205
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,615
Definitely and the Great Stone too.

206
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:25,241
Let GL whip it into the sun.

207
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,450
Wait!

208
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,656
This is the one place where

209
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,704
Kryptonite can do some good.

210
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,164
That is a fact.

211
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:34,083
We don't want Silver Banshee coming back after it.

212
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,127
So the only way I'll let the stone stay here

213
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,713
is if we seal the portal to Skartaris permanently.

214
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,590
Fine by me.

215
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,718
I got everything I need right here.

216
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,396
There. I doubt even I could get back through.

217
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,066
How are you feeling? Need a lift?

218
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,277
No. I'm good.

219
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,241
Courtney, you slow your butt down!

220
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:09,828
- Uh, my dad. - I know.

221
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,330
Superman tried to keep me on the farm.

222
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,874
Made me hide there for three years.

223
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,460
Big deal. I've still got a curfew.

224
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,087
Enough cosmic energy to trash a city

225
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,297
and I can't stay out past ten.

226
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,801
Three years on a farm.

227
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,428
In Kansas!

228
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,515
We'll have J'onn probe what's left of Metallo's mind.

229
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:33,393
I wanna know what he was going to say.

230
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:36,062
Something's going on, ain't it?
