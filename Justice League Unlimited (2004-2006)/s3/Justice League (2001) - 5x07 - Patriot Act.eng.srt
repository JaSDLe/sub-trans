1
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,594
<i>You are certain the serum will work?</i>

2
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,304
<i>Of course.</i>

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,681
In moments, he will be stronger than a 100 men.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,290
Nothing less than an artillery shell

5
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,101
would be able to penetrate his skin.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,437
A word of warning, Herr doctor.

7
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,397
The <i>Fuhrer</i> expects nothing less.

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,275
I assure you, this man will be the first of a million

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,278
super-powered soldiers, an Aryan army created

10
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,615
in the laboratory who will grind our enemies to dust.

11
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,368
I'll thank you to hand that syringe over now, Ratsy.

12
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,078
<i>Spy Smasher.</i>

13
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:38,663
Put your hands up.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,833
Now, hand it over, Fritz.

15
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,026
<i>You look well, general.</i>

16
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,986
<i>The past few months have been good to you.</i>

17
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,824
Mrs. Waller, due respect, this reassignment is a joke.

18
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,659
Never thought I'd become a desk drone.

19
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,619
I can't help you there.

20
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,163
Langley all but scrapped project Cadmus and insisted

21
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,082
on your transfer.

22
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,501
We're lucky we're not all in jail.

23
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,754
Look, the only mistake we made was trusting Luthor.

24
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,007
Wade, you know better than to dwell on the past.

25
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,051
I'm talking about right now.

26
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,512
The Justice League is still the single greatest threat

27
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,721
to global security.

28
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,473
I used to believe that too

29
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,227
but remember, we used to say the same about the Soviets.

30
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,689
Our enemy's never as evil as we imagine.

31
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,983
And maybe we're never quite as good.

32
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,191
Nuts.

33
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,294
Don't tell me the bleeding

34
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:57,987
hearts in Congress got to you.

35
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,948
- I eat them alive. - You would too.

36
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,409
You've got some onions, Amanda.

37
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,119
Then listen to me.

38
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,496
I'm not the league's greatest fan

39
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,582
but their intentions are good.

40
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,625
I <i>can</i> work with them.

41
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,335
What if you're wrong, though?

42
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,380
Turns out the metahumans aren't on the side of the angels.

43
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,008
We won't have any way to defend ourselves.

44
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,376
Look what happened last year.

45
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:21,761
Superman walked into Cadmus

46
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,637
and tossed our best men like a salad.

47
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,055
Oh, for heaven's sake.

48
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,433
What's to stop him from doing it again?

49
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,351
They're all orbiting us with a space weapon

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,270
supposedly decommissioned.

51
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,665
That's a much bigger threat than the Russians ever were.

52
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,066
<i>If we'd rolled over like this with the Soviet Union</i>

53
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,275
<i>given up our nukes...</i>

54
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,361
We'd all be living under a red flag.

55
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,322
Yes, ma'am. You better believe it.

56
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,366
After all our work, what did Cadmus accomplish?

57
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,744
You get a reprimand, I'm pushing pencils.

58
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,788
And the league gets another base here on earth

59
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,623
that metro tower.

60
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,918
When one side loses ground and the other side gains

61
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,462
that isn't a truce, it's a surrender.

62
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,509
It's a different world, general.

63
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:04,011
Learn to live in it.

64
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>Green Lantern, what's your status?</i>

65
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,602
This sun's going nova any day now.

66
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,145
It's worse than we thought.

67
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,731
We'll have to deploy twice as many fusion dampeners.

68
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,525
You're breaking up. Say again.

69
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,693
The main point is, this is gonna take a while.

70
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,071
Understood. We've got it covered on this end.

71
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,865
Check in whenever you can. Watchtower out.

72
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,410
Green Arrow, S.T.R.I.P.E., Stargirl

73
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,330
<i>Vigilante, and Shining Knight, meet me on the bridge.</i>

74
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,374
Ha!

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,918
The exact second the movie's over

76
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,126
we get a mission.

77
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,420
Dang if that ain't lucky.

78
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,673
I still say this Clint Eastwood dishonored himself

79
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,881
when he refused to...

80
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,926
What was it? Play by the rules?

81
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,134
Pardner, your medieval upbringing has done left you

82
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,180
unschooled in the ways of the moving picture.

83
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,100
No, his proper duty is to his police captain.

84
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:54,520
I see why they call him dirty, he besmirches his order.

85
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,398
Sir Justin, if you want to be watching stuff on my big TV

86
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:00,442
with the 5.1 surround sound, you had best watch what you say

87
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,486
about Mr. Clint Eastwood.

88
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,031
Half of our resources are in deep space.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,867
- We're short-handed. - Great.

90
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,452
I'll take a real assignment over watchtower duty any day.

91
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,913
So who's left up here with you, The Ray?

92
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,292
He's with Vixen, checking out an explosion in the Aleutians.

93
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,253
Flash and Supergirl aren't finished in Madagascar.

94
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,088
You're spreading us a little thin.

95
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,215
We go where we're needed, Green Arrow.

96
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,634
Did you second guess the Martian like this?

97
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,428
Sorry. My bad.

98
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:28,804
You're the big picture guy.

99
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,306
I've got it all worked out.

100
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,975
There's just this one mission in Metropolis.

101
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>I need you people to fill in for Superman.</i>

102
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,812
Cool.

103
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,772
Welcome back to the "Daily Planet"

104
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,357
and Hubble's department store's

105
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,193
87th Annual Metro Merchant's Parade.

106
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,528
I'm Rick Wilson.

107
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,114
And I'm Caitlyn O'Shaughnessy-Ruiz.

108
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,784
And who's passing the reviewing stand now but the veterans

109
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,870
Legion honor guard followed by

110
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,080
the Madison High School marching band.

111
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,666
<i>Yes, and just look who's coming next.</i>

112
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,585
<i>An old dear friend.</i>

113
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:03,839
<i>It's a bird, it's a plane it's Superman.</i>

114
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,049
<i>That's right, Rick.</i>

115
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,675
<i>Superman is held by officers</i>

116
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,004
<i>from the police department's</i>

117
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,804
19th precinct, and next up

118
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,264
more heroes.

119
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,558
Some of the brave policemen, firefighters

120
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,811
and emergency workers who serve Metropolis every day.

121
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,273
And riding with them, well, the actual Superman

122
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,984
<i>can't be here today, but he sent along</i>

123
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,445
<i>some of his Justice League cohorts.</i>

124
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,323
I'd slay the ogre Blunderbore all over again

125
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:32,076
rather than put myself on display in this manner.

126
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,119
Even though that ogre turned out to be...

127
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,704
Morgan Le Fey.

128
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,998
We've all heard it.

129
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,459
- It is a good story. - So what?

130
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,211
Since we don't have superpowers

131
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,880
it takes five of us to replace one Superman?

132
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,632
Excuse me, I just wanna thank you

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,717
Justice League guys for turning out in force.

134
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,135
It means a lot to us.

135
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,720
Hey, we can't thank you enough.

136
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,305
You're the real heroes.

137
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,391
It's you the people come to honor.

138
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,685
Great. Now I'm petty.

139
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:00,062
See where it says "Heroes one and all"?

140
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,563
That's what it's all about.

141
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,233
The crowd doesn't care who can bench press a mountain

142
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,443
or shoot lasers out of their ears.

143
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,861
Where's Superman?

144
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,822
How come none of the good ones are here?

145
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,574
I didn't come here to see some stupid cowboy.

146
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,285
I don't think Vigilante's a good role model

147
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,912
especially ones with a gun.

148
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,248
<i>I came to see Superman.</i>

149
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,508
General Eiling, sir. What brings you back to Cadmus?

150
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,844
Just came to collect something I left behind.

151
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,187
I want you men posted at the entrance to this wing.

152
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,647
Nobody in or out.

153
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,898
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

154
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,155
General, what are you doing?

155
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,740
Hello, Dr. Anderson.

156
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,825
I left my reading glasses in the bio vault

157
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,327
and can't seem to get back in.

158
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,955
That code was changed six months ago.

159
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,331
You're not authorized.

160
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,172
The new code. Now.

161
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,364
General, no. That serum's unstable.

162
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,908
I read the report.

163
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:38,285
So you know about the horrible disfigurations.

164
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,745
The test animals...

165
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,374
Too late now.

166
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,737
Shoot to kill! Now while you still can!

167
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,792
- Don't kill me. - I wouldn't kill you, soldier.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,836
You're just doing your job.

169
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,382
And now I'm going to do mine.

170
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,695
<i>Stargirl, ladies and gentlemen</i>

171
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,239
<i>the all-American sweetheart.</i>

172
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,075
Wow, you really know how to work a crowd.

173
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,743
Shoot, if I'd brung my guitar

174
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,328
I'd have 'em eating out of my hand.

175
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,999
And what do you got to say to the Shining Knight?

176
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,542
Sir Justin's a real live knight

177
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,336
from back in the olden times of King Arthur and them.

178
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,845
Friend, I am no mare at auction.

179
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,020
How about Sir Justin's horse, Winged Victory?

180
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,479
And his magical sword

181
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,899
a gift from Merlin, the magician hisself.

182
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,295
<i>Freeze!</i>

183
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,672
I'd listen to the man.

184
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,593
Where's Superman?

185
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,678
Busy. Can I help you?

186
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,889
Yeah. Hold this for me.

187
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,519
Open fire!

188
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,692
Go ahead, boys, pour it on.

189
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,901
I can take it.

190
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,294
<i>Get out of here!</i>

191
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,296
Yeah, take off, you big wuss.

192
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,673
Where's your parents?

193
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,883
I don't know. Run off, I guess.

194
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,172
Listen, I need you fellows to do a very important job

195
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,804
so you're all my deputies.

196
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:47,015
Now, go ride herd on that crowd and get 'em somewhere safe.

197
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,642
- Right, come on! - Let's go!

198
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,270
- Come on, everybody! - Gotta get out of here!

199
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,945
There was a blue car in front of me.

200
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,072
Go. I shall find it.

201
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:06,158
I mean it.

202
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,494
Get Superman and tell him

203
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,579
General Wade Eiling wants a word with him.

204
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,915
Eiling? Cadmus?

205
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,209
What happened, that beat-down he handed you last year

206
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,003
leave you with Superman issues?

207
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,754
He's your poster boy.

208
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:20,507
I'm gonna show the Justice League

209
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,218
that you're not the only superpower on the block

210
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,178
that there's someone who can stop you.

211
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,597
I'm here to protect them from you.

212
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,481
blast

213
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,570
Mr. Terrific, we need backup.

214
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,405
Everybody's in play somewhere else.

215
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,073
Everybody.

216
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,322
I'll see if I can scrounge

217
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,784
<i>a few reserve leaguers.</i>

218
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,290
Come on, folks! Stay together!

219
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:54,624
That's right, no straggling.

220
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:24,071
I'll give you issues.

221
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:41,421
Eiling, don't do it!

222
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,402
Hang on, little feller!

223
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,049
Yeah!

224
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,968
Pretty fancy riding there, cowboy.

225
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:30,554
- What you got for an encore? - Never you mind.

226
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,514
Get this dang area clear of civilians!

227
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:33,723
Scoot!

228
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,017
Hey, you, buzz off!

229
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,403
Stand back, darling!

230
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,323
Yee-hoo!

231
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,293
You lousy bush-leaguers.

232
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:02,794
I'm running out of patience.

233
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,256
You too? We're taking this someplace else.

234
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,550
Haven't you ever heard of innocent bystanders?

235
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,719
Ever hear of acceptable losses?

236
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,263
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.

237
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,552
<i>This country's halfway down the toilet because of you</i>

238
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,975
<i>super-powered types.</i>

239
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,561
For the record, I don't have powers, potty mouth.

240
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:20,979
It's the staff.

241
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,157
In that case, miss, you're just another egg.

242
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:35,535
Beast villain! Have you no shame?

243
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,841
You hit him high, I'll hit him low.

244
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,051
Whatever.

245
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,684
Vig!

246
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,093
<i>Found your reinforcements, GA</i>

247
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,562
<i>I'm teleporting them in now.</i>

248
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,272
Got that. Thanks, T.

249
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,565
Well, you wanted Superman?

250
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,235
Now you got...

251
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:11,029
the Crimson Avenger and my ex-sidekick.

252
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,489
Ex-partner.

253
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,449
Speedy, we got to do this now?

254
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,202
Ooh, now I'm scared.

255
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:34,427
Ollie, how may guys has this doofus taken out?

256
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,097
That would be all of 'em.

257
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,184
You spoiled, rich little twerp.

258
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,769
I think he means me.

259
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,897
Oh, for a second I was all mad.

260
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,570
Still got your quantum arrow?

261
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:54,114
- Yeah, but you said... - This is an emergency.

262
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,055
We are so dead.

263
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,264
Could be.

264
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,519
Yah!

265
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,738
Superman, you coward, all your men are down

266
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,615
and you won't even show your face!

267
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,117
<i>He cannot hear even your bellowing, monster.</i>

268
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,078
As we speak, Superman rescues and entire star system

269
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,580
a universe away.

270
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:44,788
Do your worst.

271
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,750
I'll not let you harm another.

272
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,628
I do what I do with service to my country.

273
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:52,839
Once, at the word of my Lord, King Arthur

274
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,884
I was ordered to lay waste to an entire village.

275
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,262
I knew my king's heart could not be so unjust

276
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,889
so I spared them all.

277
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:03,183
Then you're a lousy soldier.

278
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,981
There it is, the creeping moral decay of the past

279
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,358
thousand years.

280
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,736
Arthur thanked me, oaf.

281
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,072
Had I been wrong, I would have handed over my sword

282
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,574
and left the court in shame.

283
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,918
Save yourself a hospital stay and stand down.

284
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,796
That magic armor won't help you.

285
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,131
Have at thee!

286
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,425
You're a relic.

287
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,927
In this world, power is

288
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,970
the only thing that matters.

289
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,225
You and those other no-name heroes, you're just people.

290
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,686
In the great scheme of things, nothing you do

291
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:50,480
has the least bit of significance.

292
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,402
I'll waste you and a million like you

293
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,405
before I let any power rival America's.

294
00:19:58,613 --> 00:19:59,614
It's my duty.

295
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,283
You don't know what the word means.

296
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,868
You can't win.

297
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,997
I'll die as befits a knight, defending the weak.

298
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,126
Why don't you give up?

299
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,002
Why don't you?

300
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,680
Superman and your Justice League

301
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,850
are a threat to a safe and stable world.

302
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,520
Drop the act.

303
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,524
You think killing Superman would make the world safe?

304
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,986
Or killing this boy? Or us?

305
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,655
Tell me, how many of us

306
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,242
do you have to kill to keep us safe?

307
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,619
They're the ones I'm after, not you.

308
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,581
I'm not the menace, metahumans are.

309
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,583
Super-powered beings.

310
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,753
You're the only one around here with super powers.

311
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:12,479
Alright, I've become what I hate, I'll give you that.

312
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,815
<i>But in the long run, you'll see I was right.</i>

313
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,569
You'll see you need the likes of me to protect you from them.

314
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,223
<i>Don't you worry, Sir Justin.</i>

315
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,271
Them 21 st-century docs are gonna have you back

316
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,310
<i>on your feet by movie night.</i>

317
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,978
Hold.

318
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,730
I have yet to thank you.

319
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,566
No need to thank me, son.

320
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,110
You just get better.

321
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,780
World still needs protecting, you know?

322
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,371
Come on, let's play Justice League!

323
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:14,415
- I'm Shiny Knight! - No, I am!

324
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,042
You're the stupid monster.

325
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,585
Ha! Have at thee!

326
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,921
Have at thee!

327
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,590
Fine, I don't care. I'm Vigilante.

328
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,384
He's way cooler.
