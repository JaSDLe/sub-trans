1
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:22,396
What's with the running, doc?

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,815
We both know how this is gonna turn out.

3
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,526
I didn't tell anyone.

4
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:28,277
I swear!

5
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,696
Good, then you're the only loose end.

6
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,516
You can scream now, if you want.

7
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,763
I've never fully understood

8
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,310
the mechanics of dreams.

9
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,187
I don't have them myself.

10
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,731
Well, this one's doing

11
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,190
a number on my ceiling

12
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,317
and pa Kent's getting tired of patching it.

13
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,069
I will say this.

14
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,988
What I saw was far more linear

15
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,906
than ordinary dream logic.

16
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,617
But it didn't seem like a memory either.

17
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,661
It was inconclusive.

18
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,165
You mean, I might actually

19
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,750
have done these things?

20
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,042
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,627
I just don't know.

22
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,671
<i>J'onn, President Chojeb on one.</i>

23
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm going to put you on the inactive roster

24
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:18,631
for a few days.

25
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,839
Let me know what you find.

26
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,596
What's the big deal?

27
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,765
You had some nightmares.

28
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,013
These weren't just dreams.

29
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,768
They felt like they really happened.

30
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:32,062
I don't know. I've had some dreams that felt mighty real.

31
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,939
There was this one the other night...

32
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,775
The point is I couldn't live with myself

33
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,526
if I really did what I saw.

34
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,445
Now, are you gonna help me or not?

35
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:40,988
Of course, kid.

36
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,448
But vague memories of a probe

37
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,742
like one of those alien abduction things.

38
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,070
Maybe you've just been hanging out in Kansas too long.

39
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,038
Wouldn't be so sure.

40
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,040
Especially when she's the alien.

41
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,294
Got all the signs of repressed memory.

42
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,047
People dream what their minds don't want to remember.

43
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,591
Easier to convince themselves it's all bunk.

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,676
Repressed memories of what?

45
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,885
When?

46
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,137
You've been to S.T.A.R Labs

47
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,639
treated for injuries there.

48
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,349
Yeah, a few years ago.

49
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,976
When Superman was brainwashed and attacked the earth.

50
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,521
I got hurt, and he took me to S.T.A.R for help.

51
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,231
I was in a coma for part of it.

52
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,732
Meaning there's a gap in time

53
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,108
you can't account for.

54
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,360
That's when.

55
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:21,487
Okay, enough. Don't listen to this guy.

56
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:23,531
Everything's conspiracies with him.

57
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,032
Not conspiracies.

58
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,241
Conspiracy.

59
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:27,993
Singular.

60
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>Reaching back to ancient Egypt</i>

61
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,164
<i>there's been a single cabal of powerful individuals</i>

62
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>directing the course of human history.</i>

63
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,898
But the common man prefers to believe

64
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,253
they don't exist.

65
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,213
Which aids their success.

66
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,714
Global warming

67
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,050
military upheavals in the third world

68
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,386
actors elected to public office?

69
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,012
<i>The spread of coffee bars</i>

70
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>germs outpacing antibiotics</i>

71
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,181
<i>and boy bands?</i>

72
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,224
Come on.

73
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,935
Who would gain from all this?

74
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,143
Who indeed?

75
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,524
What does any of this have to do with my dreams?

76
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,276
If I'm right, you're part of it.

77
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:01,644
You're going to need my help.

78
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:02,777
I'm going with you.

79
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,448
Hold your horses.

80
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,242
No one asked for more help.

81
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,678
This whole trip might just prove

82
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,620
the kid shouldn't eat nachos before bed.

83
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,955
Peanut butter sandwiches.

84
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:14,498
How did you...

85
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,750
What? Do you go through my trash?

86
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,377
Please.

87
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,087
I go through everyone's trash.

88
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,716
<i>This is where we treated you</i>

89
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,050
<i>when you were in your coma.</i>

90
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,303
You were on life support the whole time.

91
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:29,096
I promise, you weren't running around

92
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,681
on violent missions.

93
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,650
<i>Well, then, Professor Hamilton, maybe you can</i>

94
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,643
explain why her memories led her here?

95
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,521
I think I can explain it.

96
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,316
You mentioned some sort of torture device.

97
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:42,693
- Yes. - With robotic arms.

98
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,528
And a long probe in the center.

99
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,738
Cut to the chase.

100
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,426
You say you've seen something like it?

101
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,866
In fact, I have.

102
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,120
That's it.

103
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,997
<i>It's not a torture device.</i>

104
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,166
It's a surgical robot.

105
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,376
That's a kryptonite-tipped lance.

106
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,338
It was the only way to operate on you, Supergirl.

107
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,089
That robot saved your life.

108
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,675
As for the rest of your dream

109
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,553
we humans are used to being vulnerable.

110
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,597
But to you, surgery must have seemed

111
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,265
terribly invasive.

112
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,935
And powerless to defend yourself

113
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,103
it's possible your mind constructed

114
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,522
a scenario of fighting back.

115
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,946
So, I think that answered everything.

116
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,447
Little too well.

117
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,991
Does everything have a sinister motive in your world?

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,410
Yours, too. You just don't know it.

119
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,245
Uh, guys.

120
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,450
Huh. Ooh.

121
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,065
What was that about?

122
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,316
What do you think?

123
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,525
We're asking questions

124
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:48,902
someone doesn't want answered.

125
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,238
Oh, learn a new tune already.

126
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,906
I'm starting to think he's right.

127
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,075
That robot came after me.

128
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,618
The rest of this was just

129
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,412
a distraction.

130
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,873
<i>Standard Z8 combat trainer.</i>

131
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,416
Like the ones we use.

132
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,293
The League buys 'em in bulk.

133
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,711
So?

134
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,921
So, who do we buy them from?

135
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,174
The army, I think.

136
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,092
Oh, wait a minute.

137
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,677
Another fun fact.

138
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,096
The man who commissioned the Z8 project.

139
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,515
The same man who put you in the hospital.

140
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,184
General Hardcastle?

141
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,685
He's retired now, isn't he?

142
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,062
Gone.

143
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,897
And hoping to be forgotten.

144
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,367
<i>Figured someone would come</i>

145
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,161
<i>for me some day.</i>

146
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,454
Only, I thought they'd be

147
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,539
from the other side.

148
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
This weapon fires a projectile

149
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:46,376
of kryptonite pellets suspended in

150
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,712
a liquid silicon core.

151
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,507
Causes maximum scatter on impact.

152
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,050
Only gets one shot

153
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,635
but trust me, alien

154
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,512
it'll do the job.

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,888
We're not here to hurt you.

156
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,681
We just have some questions.

157
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,518
Sorry if I don't take your word for it.

158
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,979
As I recall, your kind can be fickle.

159
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,316
Okay, now what, smart guy?

160
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,777
Use up your magic bullet on me and you're left with one

161
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,654
very ticked off Supergirl.

162
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,576
Now, be a good host

163
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,785
and tell us a story.

164
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:23,872
The army shut me out

165
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,542
after Superman invaded.

166
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,086
The feeling upstairs was I failed

167
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,337
when it counted most

168
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,006
so how could I lead again?

169
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,215
I got the message

170
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,218
and took early retirement.

171
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,720
Problem is I know too much.

172
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,929
One of these days

173
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,099
they'll decide to shut me up.

174
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,226
Who will? What do you know?

175
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,811
The military and big business

176
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,313
have been in cahoots for decades.

177
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,773
Top secret stuff

178
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,483
experiments on metahumans

179
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,485
mutants, aliens.

180
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,404
Searching for new technologies

181
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,489
both for national security

182
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,907
and profit.

183
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,451
That volcano woman... she was one of ours.

184
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,870
Same with those freaks

185
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,622
The Joker made up like playing cards.

186
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,457
Any of it have to do with Supergirl?

187
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,585
It has to do with all of them.

188
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,962
Your little club up in that spaceship?

189
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,798
There's a file on every one of you.

190
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,049
But I don't know anything

191
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,218
about these dreams of yours.

192
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,596
<i>If it is connected to these people</i>

193
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:21,805
<i>I've been out of the loop</i>

194
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,682
<i>too long to know.</i>

195
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,185
And how do we find "these people?"

196
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,645
You don't. They find you.

197
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:34,817
Sorry, kid.

198
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,236
Dead end, I guess.

199
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,030
Not necessarily.

200
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,490
Need some time to process this.

201
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,159
Martian, pick us up.

202
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,711
What? I told you everything I...

203
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,297
Supergirl?

204
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:56,505
Yes.

205
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,219
And no.

206
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,929
Friends call me Tea.

207
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,056
Are you a friend, general?

208
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,855
Guess that's a no.

209
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:21,949
It's okay.

210
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:23,242
You fell asleep.

211
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,160
Excuse me if I bore you.

212
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,369
Hey, lay off.

213
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,495
<i>Hardcastle's gone.</i>

214
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,081
I just know.

215
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,252
- 'Question.' - Go ahead.

216
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,670
Look at your monitor.

217
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,838
I'm patching through a live feed.

218
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,465
<i>A scientist named Gilbert Halstrom</i>

219
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,008
<i>has been reported missing.</i>

220
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,262
<i>He's from a biotech company called Nuvo-Gen.</i>

221
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,472
<i>It's the man from Kara's dream.</i>

222
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,307
He really exists.

223
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,476
Or did anyway.

224
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,271
And only one network had the story.

225
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,207
Now, that's the first lead in this whole business

226
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,524
I can wrap my head around.

227
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:56,775
We go to Nuvo-Gen.

228
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,485
We find out who this guy is.

229
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,946
No. First we find the source of the report.

230
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,447
What for?

231
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,700
Don't you know who owns the eagle network?

232
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,245
The real owners.

233
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,540
Look, why don't we split up?

234
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,375
Kara and I will go to Nuvo-Gen.

235
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,918
You go wherever you want.

236
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,890
Hey, Lasser.

237
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,601
Saw that piece on eagle today.

238
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,103
Now, that's reporting.

239
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,188
Thanks. You get home safe.

240
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,358
The thing is that Nuvo-Gen's

241
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,776
a real hush-hush joint

242
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,903
and, uh, Halstrom didn't have no family

243
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,280
to file a missing persons.

244
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,823
So, between you and me

245
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,658
how'd you hear about that story?

246
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,827
Good old-fashioned legwork, Jerry.

247
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,329
You should try it sometime.

248
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,709
Commodore Hotel.

249
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,758
- Something wrong? - Gotta write up my fare report.

250
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,030
So, what do you think of that

251
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,388
corporate prepackaged pop

252
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,723
kids like these days?

253
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,308
Hate it.

What happened to Frank?

259
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,298
I heard some contest guy showed up at his door.

260
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,591
Free trip to Aruba.

261
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,052
Why him and not me?

262
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Tell me about it.

Good cold one's more like it.

00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,520
Free trip to Aruba?

266
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,230
Had to send Frank somewhere.

267
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:00,190
Shame how he dropped his keycard though.

268
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,031

270
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,698
This girl I've been seeing

271
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:11,742
she-she slipped it to me.

272
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:13,245
Said I-I could run with it.

273
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,453
The girl.

274
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,496
Tell me more.

275
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,581
She's just a girl.

276
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,083
Blond hair, blue eyes.

277
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,793
Real farmer's daughter type.

278
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,837
And a handshake like a vice?

279
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,713
Yeah, really strong. How'd you...

280
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,882
- How long you been seeing her? - About a week.

281
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,384
She have bad dreams?

282
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,761
More like tossing and turning.

283
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,096
Can't sleep at night.

284
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,603
Halstrom was getting drowned in e-mails

285
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,932
from their legal department.

286
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,541
Sounds like they were scared he was gonna

287
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,024
blow the whistle on something.

288
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,233
Doesn't say what.

289
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,406
I don't believe it.

290
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,533
That crazy old Hardcastle was right.

291
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:54,244
These guys claim they're splicing heartier tomatoes

292
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,893
but really they've been experimenting

293
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,581
with metahuman DNA.

294
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,332
Not just any DNA

295
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,876
My DNA.

296
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,084
Look.

297
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,009
This folder was marked "Metropolis Training Exercises."

298
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:11,928
It's me.

299
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,139
<i>Um, a little more</i>

300
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:15,682
<i>mature than you.</i>

301
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,267
But I see your point.

302
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,810
They cloned me.

303
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,313
We must have some sort of psychic link.

304
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,190
That's why I'm seeing things I didn't do.

305
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,168
What is this place?

306
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,961
It's a hologram chamber.

307
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,671
Hard light constructs.

308
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,089
Must be a training program.

309
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,509
<i>My training program.</i>

310
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,312
<i>And so.</i>

311
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,813
<i>What do you think?</i>

312
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,274
It's important that you like yourself

313
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,776
and I'm you...

314
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,570
just accelerated a few extra years

315
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,280
plus better trained.

316
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,740
And I have to say

317
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,408
a heck of a lot smarter.

318
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,244
You lured us here.

319
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,430
After your lackeys couldn't get rid of me at S.T.A.R

320
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,498
you decided to deal with me yourself

321
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,083
on your home turf.

322
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,085
It's like you're reading my mind.

323
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,337
Which is actually the problem

324
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,588
and why you have to die.

- Who do you work for? - Really?

342
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,688
At the top, even I don't know that.

343
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:51,398
But I do know I can't work in secret

344
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,650
if you keep seeing what I do.

345
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,194
So, <i>sayonara,</i> sister.

346
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,737
<i>That's not the only reason, is it?</i>

347
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,322
You were setting up this bait

348
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,701
even before Supergirl started asking questions.

349
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,371
It's because the link works both ways, doesn't it?

350
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,415
While she was seeing what you were doing

351
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:11,000
you were feeling her conscience.

352
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,044
That's why you couldn't sleep at night.

353
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,255
And I bet it got in the way of your work.

354
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,924
It bites having someone in your head

355
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,509
doesn't it?

356
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,594
You don't know what you're talking about.

357
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,803
No?

358
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,181
Prove it.

359
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,390
Kill me.

360
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,579
Understood.

361
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,232
No! I can do this.

362
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,865
It's too late!

363
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,467
We searched what was left of the place

364
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,968
but we never found the clone.

365
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,678
Maybe there was nothing to find.

366
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,014
Or that's what they want us to think.

367
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,058
I'm just glad you're okay, Supergirl.

368
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,352
Professor, to make this clone of me

369
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,562
they would have needed a DNA sample.

370
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,023
Is there any chance it came from your lab?

371
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,441
No, we always destroy

372
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,318
genetic material after surgery.

373
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,861
It's standard procedure.

374
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,822
Okay, thanks, professor.

375
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,740
<i>Give my best to Superman.</i>

376
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,201
Will do. Bye.

377
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:09,569
I still don't get why someone

378
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,120
cloned you in the first place.

379
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,123
<i>This all started because Superman went renegade.</i>

380
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,001
They want a Superhuman alien on their side

381
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,210
if it ever happens again.

382
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,296
Whoever they are.

383
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:29,596
<i>You rest.</i>

384
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,268
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

385
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,354
Galatea.
