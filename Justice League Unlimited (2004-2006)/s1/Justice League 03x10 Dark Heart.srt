So...remind me again why we picked this mesa to climb?

Because once we're up there

we'll be able to see half of Nevada.

00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,909
These things build copies of themselves

169
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,082
using whatever material is around

170
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,412
and they'll only stop when everything is gone.

171
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,621
So this isn't just about these three towns?

172
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:20,831
No.

173
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,586
They'll go coast to coast

174
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,088
and then across the seabed.

175
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,547
They'll use rock, metal, plastic, plant life.

176
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,426
- People. - Yes.

177
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,054
And destroying the replicated machines isn't enough.

178
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,602
You have to get to the system's core control.

179
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,225
If we destroy the mother ship.

180
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,523
You have to understand, making metal out of rock

181
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,521
is a microscopic process.

182
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,150
The core control is issuing instructions at an atomic scale.

183
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,605
You can't just smash up a machine

184
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,190
the size of an infection.

185
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,445
Leave a crumb of it intact

186
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,151
and it'll start all over again.

187
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,736
You have to get me to the main ship.

188
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,038
I have to go inside that thing and reprogram it.

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,581
[intense music]

190
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,842
All points, this is Batman. We have a new plan.

191
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,299
We have to get the Atom to the main vessel.

192
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,509
Superman puts him and Wonder Woman there.

193
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,140
Half of us back her up.

194
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,018
Everyone else, we draw a line here.

195
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,817
No one is going to die because of us. Go.

196
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,191
- Ready? - Just don't squeeze.

197
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,157
Let's go to work.

Palmer to Batman.

I think I'm almost there. Stand by.

223
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,558
- Wow. - 'What's your status?'

224
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,351
This is incredible.

225
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,936
Every atom of it is filled

226
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,612
with a book's worth of information.

227
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,987
- It's beautifully simple. It-- - 'Save it for the autopsy.'

00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,910
I think I can access it.

229
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,995
I knew it.

230
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,701
'It carries its own history.'

231
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,128
It copies it into each replicant.

232
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,832
Batman, can you hear me? It's a war machine.

(Ray) 'Two planets at war.'

235
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,879
It's builders launched it at a whole other planet

236
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,931
'like a cruise missile.'

'And it followed its programming.'

'Reproduce, go to the next occupied planet, reproduce.'

241
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,978
Maybe this war was fought across the galaxy.

242
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,905
But it doesn't know the war is over.

If I'm reading the symbols right, the original device

00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,652
was constructed more than 50,000 years ago.

Batman, I've lost contact. Are you there?

Come on, come on! It's here somewhere. I know it.

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,645
Yes! The core control.

[groaning]

00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,071
It won't break. I have no tools. Think.

No tools...except this one.

254
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,918
Controlling my size and weight. Be direct.

- 'What's happening in there?' - It didn't break.

I couldn't break the heart. It--

'It what?'

00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,241
I couldn't break the heart.

262
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,448
But I bet I can give it a heart attack.

263
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,330
These arteries are feeding liquefied matter into the heart.

264

If I can interrupt that flow

265
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,339
starve it of matter, build up some pressure.

Oh, I don't know.

Maybe because it turns out the Justice League

284
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,843
has had a secret space-based weapon

285

and every other thing it saw
