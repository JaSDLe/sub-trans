10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,366

This comb belonged to Cleopatra.

You robbed a museum?

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,307
Is that why you're wearing that goofy cat suit?

Yeah, they thought you were crazy

25
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,895
because you kept insisting you were on the verge

26
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,695
of discovering...time travel.

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,819
It's my chrono suit. I've had it working for months.

28
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,366
I've been using it to gather treasures for my collection.

And you said I was a loser.

Let me get this straight.

31
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,959
You've got a suit that lets you travel in time

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,379
and you've been using it to steal historical trash?

- You stupid little man! - Huh?

34
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,460
You could go back and steal gold and jewels.

35
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,761
You could get stock information from the future.

36

- We could be rich. - No!

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,681
We can't use the suit to do

38
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,554
anything that could change history.

Don't I get a trial?

171
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,629
Sure.

172

You're guilty.

My town, my rules.

Wait a minute. Can't we talk about this?

How about another hand? Double or nothing!

I think we know how things work here now.

That's not what we're here for.

Someone's tampering with history.

The stakes are much bigger than the life of one card shark.

"A man who sticks his head in the sand

I got business to conclude before I leave.

How do you know who I am?

Because he's the man we're looking for.

216
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,369

at your disposal.

218
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,543
You tried to steal Batman's utility belt.

00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,588
And you chased me, but time tunnels

220

Even though you were only seconds behind me

Now, that's a story.

As soon as I got here, I was robbed.

Yes, ma'am.

228
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,643
He took my suit and used it

229
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,691
to take over this town.

230
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,393
He keeps taking trips to the future

231
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,570
and coming back with stolen technology.

232

He keeps me here to teach him how to use the stuff that..

...he can't work out for himself.

Which, I'd suspect, is most of it

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,241
what with him being so mule-stupid and all.

It's been horrible here. Humiliating!
