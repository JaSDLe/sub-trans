00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,284
Uhh, uhh.

169
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,960
You lied to me, Luthor.

170
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,378
Mmf uhh!

171
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,671
Ooh!

172
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,545
(Android) 'Manipulated me.'

173
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:56,380
Used me to serve your own despicable ends.

174
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,512
What are you waiting for? Just do it.

175
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,263
Good idea.

176
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,188
A subatomic universe.

177
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,644
Figured the Android can't kill what he can't see.

178
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,231
(Android) 'Oh, but I can see you.'

179
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,073
Did you really think I couldn't follow you here?

180
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,661
No universe, however large, however small, is denied to me.

181
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,338
What do you want from me?

182
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,087
You have everything humans desire..

183
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,464
Wealth, power..

184
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,466
Yet you crave more

185
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,798
and you'll do anything to get it.

186
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:44,102
'Why? What is your ultimate purpose?'

187
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:49,103
What you're really asking is, what is yours?

188
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,752
Wait. Please.

189
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,756
The Android's nature has proved benign before.

190
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,632
I believe it will again.

191
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:23,433
Benign? You call destroying Oa benign?

192
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,727
Not even you can stand against the Green Lantern Corps.

193
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,836
What the devil's going on?

194
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,881
Lex Luthor is saving the world.

195
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,343
The truth is, for all my struggles

196
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,798
to make my mark in life, for all I've accomplished

197
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:07,181
in just a few short generations, my name will be forgotten.

198
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:12,482
Even the greatest of us can't compete with time and death.

199
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,857
Then why do you go on? Why does anyone?

200
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,611
Why don't I just destroy you and everything else right now?

201
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,033
'All it would take is a single thought and--'

202
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,738
No! If you do that, you won't see the end of it.

203
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,447
The end of what?

204
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,581
The evolutionary process.

205
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,834
You, of all beings, should know something about that.

206
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,087
Yes, yes, I'm evolving.

207
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,714
That's why Professor Ivo made me.

208
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,139
These past months, I have amassed so much knowledge

209
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,844
and yet I remain confused, empty.

210
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,101
What am I evolving into? What is my purpose?

211
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,182
I must know! Tell me!

212
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,394
There's no way to tell.

213
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,854
And that's why I stay in the game.

214
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,487
My purpose, if you will, is to see where it's all going.

215
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,616
And you, you'll live forever.

216
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,163
You'll be able to see it all.

217
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,790
Is that my purpose? Simply to be a witness?

218
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,338
We create our own purpose in life.

219
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,461
Now go create yours.

220
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,228
You know, when I heard you were coming

221
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,105
I was actually afraid of you. Petrified.

222
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,608
But now, when I see your fear, your uncertainty

223
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,064
I just pity you.

224
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,111
Should have quit while you were ahead.

225
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,780
Oh! Aah!

226
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,710
Ohh!

227
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,979
- Get out of the way. - It's over, isn't it?

228
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,430
Yes.

229
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,606
He murders an entire world, and it's over?

230
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,152
Just like that? I don't think so.

231
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,320
I did not destroy Oa.

232
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,274
I simply moved it to another dimension.

233
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,659
It was in my way.

234
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,991
Then could you move it back?

235
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,789
Done.

236
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,081
I can help you on your journey

237
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,883
and your search for meaning.

238
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:49,510
- Help me? Why? - Because that is my purpose.

239
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,090
I accept your offer.

240
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,603
- Told you we'd beat 'em. - What do you mean, "we?"

241

We have another guest, Inza.

243
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,458
Would you prepare a place for him?

244
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,585
Of course. Welcome.

245
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,425
Are you alright?

246
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,594
Fine, although there was a moment

247
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,046
when I actually thought John Stewart

248
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,597
was going to attack me.

249
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,720
(Hawkgirl) Oh, I don't know about that.
