1
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:08,966
<i>We regret to say that your request to leave Earth</i>

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:13,137
and begin a tour of duty on Oa has been denied.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,348
This is important. You can't just...

4
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,892
No debates, John Stewart.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,644
We've made our decision.

6
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:24,941
With all due respect... wouldn't it be a simple matter

7
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,610
for John and Kyle Rayner to trade duties

8
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,070
for just a short time?

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:30,878
You know, I am getting a little homesick.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,033
Sure would be nice to see Earth again.

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,744
The Green Lantern Corps is a military institution

12
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,330
dedicated to the protection of the galaxy.

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,792
We will not alter our decisions, disrupt our plans

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,921
simply because of your personal problems.

15
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,924
It's our business to know these things.

16
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:52,635
You're going to have to work through it, John.

17
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,680
What is it?

18
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:00,601
<i>There's an unidentified object approaching Oa</i>

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,437
at a somewhat astonishing speed.

20
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,231
We're on it.

21
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,762
Nothing's going to get through this baby.

22
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,796
Activate planetary defenses.

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,089
Magnify image.

24
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,679
- Professor Ivo's android. - Holy mother of...

25
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,638
Oa. It's gone. Just like that.

26
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,556
We've got another problem.

27
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,067
The Android's heading for Earth.

28
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,904
We'll set up three layers of defense.

29
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,157
<i>One on the ground, one in the upper atmosphere, one in space.</i>

30
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,702
That's me. I want to hammer that thing

31
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,230
before it gets anywhere near here.

32
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,286
Move out.

33
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,923
What is it?

34
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,217
When the Android left Earth he said he'd evolved

35
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,053
to a level where none of us could offer him anything.

36
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,097
So why is he coming back?

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,937
<i>Your new book,</i> Into The Light

38
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,399
<i>certainly projects the image of a man who's reformed.</i>

39
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:58,112
But many people are skeptical, Mr. Luthor, for good reason.

40
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,781
I understand their skepticism, Saroya

41
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,077
but the fact is I'm not the man I was before.

42
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,829
This device may prevent the spread

43
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:10,458
of my kryptonite-induced cancer for another 30 years.

44
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,626
Or another 30 days.

45
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,588
For all I know, it might only be another 30 minutes.

46
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,882
However fate plays her hand

47
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,634
I want my remaining time to have meaning

48
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,555
to make a positive difference in the world.

49
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,182
So you're a new man.

50
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,311
No grudges, no vendettas, even against the Justice League?

51
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,564
Oh, far from it. I owe them everything.

52
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,402
They trusted me when no one else would.

53
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,905
I'd like to think that we might be friends some...

54
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,113
What the devil?

55
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,337
Let go!

56
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,923
Keep fighting me, Lex, and I just might.

57
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,054
What is this about?

58
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,598
There's an old friend of yours coming back to town.

59
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,016
Ivo's android.

60
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,188
Wherever you're taking me won't be safe enough

61
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,607
but I have just the place.

62
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,581
- A barbershop? - Gotta hand it to you, Luthor.

63
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,625
Nobody would think to look for you here.

64
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:52,059
So after you get your nose hairs trimmed, then what?

65
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,602
Just watch.

66
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Hey!

67
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,296
- Where? - Guess we just pick one.

68
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:33,559
Kryptonite. Uhh.

69
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,480
Thinks of everything, doesn't he?

70
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,034
Open.

71
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,972
<i>What's the matter, Lex?</i>

72
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,850
- 'Scared?' - The atom.

73
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,650
You came with the other two, no doubt.

74
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,693
You sound so disappointed.

75
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,488
The most powerful creature in the universe wants my head

76
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:30,783
and the league sends its least powerful member to protect me.

77
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,994
Come on, Lex. You're smarter than that.

78
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,080
You know I'm an expert on nanotechnology.

79
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,665
Yes, yes.

80
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:41,001
The very same technology Ivo used to create the Android.

81
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,214
Which means I'm just the man

82
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,257
to find the chink in the Android's armor.

83
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,551
And how are you going to find that chink

84
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,512
without the Android's blueprints?

85
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,681
The League confiscated them.

86
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,688
And now they've unconfiscated them.

87
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,547
<i>You cannot keep me from my goal.</i>

88
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,553
- Telepathy. - I'm not impressed.

89
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,222
Why have you come back? What do you want?

90
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,809
<i>Why do you ask questions you already know the answer to?</i>

91
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,937
- Luthor. <i>- 'Of course.</i>

92
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,943
We're not going to give them up.

93
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,947
He's your enemy. You owe him nothing.

94
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,783
Turn back now.

95
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:59,538
I have evolved far beyond what I was when we last met.

96
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,833
You do not want to challenge me.

97
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,293
Line 'em up!

98
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:41,622
The Android, why does he hate you so much?

99
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,417
I once took advantage of his naivete.

100
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,669
He's not naive anymore

101
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,798
and I've stopped taking advantage of the innocent.

102
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,406
Let's hope you'll be more convincing

103
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,134
if you have to tell him that.

104
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,343
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

105
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:59,556
Bad news?

106
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,788
Not the laser, use the proton gun.

107
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,957
And completely fry the circuitry?

108
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,959
That's what circuit breakers are for.

109
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,294
Sure, if you're not in a hurry. Are you?

110
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,297
Don't question me, you incompetent idiot!

111
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,009
We'll beat 'em, Lex.

112
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
We will.

113
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,776
Where are you?

114
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:12,337
<i>and connect the Heisenberg compensators in series.</i>

115
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,720
- He's coming in. - Not for long.

116
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:19,446
Your bravery is admirable, but annoying.

117
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,939
Second line of defense is down.

118
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,024
Prepare yourselves.

119
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,110
You'll need that cannon very soon.

120
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:01,446
Then stop interrupting us!

121
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:07,452
- Have you come to offer help? - Not help. Hope.

122
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,382
When will you learn?

123
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,503
Lock and load.

124
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,450
An intriguing idea, modifying the cannon

125
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,953
so that it could alter my programming.

126
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:16,039
And it might have worked a month ago

127
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,208
when I was still nanotech

128
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,378
but I have transcended that limitation.

129
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,322
You're alive.

130
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,033
Which is more than I can say for Oa.

131
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,785
What's the plan?

132
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,514
We're going to use every bit of power we have left in our rings.

133
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,206
Take one last shot at the Android.

134
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,252
A blast like that could destroy half the planet.

135
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,837
Half a planet's better than none.

136
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,009
It's the only way.

137
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,511
Hmm, those words are always used

138
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,597
to justify destruction.

139
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,850
We can only guess how much power the Android has amassed

140
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:19,269
as it's worked its way across the galaxy.

141
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,522
It has to be stopped, Fate. Here and now.

142
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,316
Not just for the sake of this world

143
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,109
but for all worlds.

144
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,236
Then for the sake of all worlds

145
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,989
I will continue to seek a better way.

146
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,962
You lied to me, Luthor.

147
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,551
<i>Manipulated me.</i>

148
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,389
Used me to serve your own despicable ends.

149
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,518
What are you waiting for? Just do it.

150
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,269
Good idea.

151
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,194
A subatomic universe.

152
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,655
Figured the Android can't kill what he can't see.

153
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,241
<i>Oh, but I can see you.</i>

154
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,083
Did you really think I couldn't follow you here?

155
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,671
No universe, however large, however small, is denied to me.

156
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:30,340
What do you want from me?

157
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,093
You have everything humans desire...

158
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,470
Wealth, power...

159
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,472
Yet you crave more

160
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,808
and you'll do anything to get it.

161
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:44,104
<i>Why? What is your ultimate purpose?</i>

162
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:49,109
What you're really asking is, what is yours?

163
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,758
Wait. Please.

164
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,761
The Android's nature has proved benign before.

165
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,638
I believe it will again.

166
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:23,435
Benign? You call destroying Oa benign?

167
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:26,730
Not even you can stand against the Green Lantern Corps.

168
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,838
What the devil's going on?

169
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,883
Lex Luthor is saving the world.

170
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:59,346
The truth is, for all my struggles

171
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,807
to make my mark in life, for all I've accomplished

172
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:07,187
in just a few short generations, my name will be forgotten.

173
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:12,484
Even the greatest of us can't compete with time and death.

174
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:16,863
Then why do you go on? Why does anyone?

175
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,617
Why don't I just destroy you and everything else right now?

176
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:23,036
<i>All it would take is a single thought and...</i>

177
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:26,748
No! If you do that, you won't see the end of it.

178
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,458
The end of what?

179
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,586
The evolutionary process.

180
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,839
You, of all beings, should know something about that.

181
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,093
Yes, yes, I'm evolving.

182
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,720
That's why Professor Ivo made me.

183
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,140
These past months, I have amassed so much knowledge

184
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,853
and yet I remain confused, empty.

185
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,107
What am I evolving into? What is my purpose?

186
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:54,192
I must know! Tell me!

187
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,404
There's no way to tell.

188
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,864
And that's why I stay in the game.

189
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,493
My purpose, if you will, is to see where it's all going.

190
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,621
And you, you'll live forever.

191
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,165
You'll be able to see it all.

192
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,795
Is that my purpose? Simply to be a witness?

193
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,340
We create our own purpose in life.

194
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,467
Now go create yours.

195
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,231
You know, when I heard you were coming

196
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,110
I was actually afraid of you. Petrified.

197
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:41,614
But now, when I see your fear, your uncertainty

198
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,074
I just pity you.

199
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,121
Should have quit while you were ahead.

200
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,980
- Get out of the way. - It's over, isn't it?

201
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,440
Yes.

202
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,609
He murders an entire world, and it's over?

203
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:21,154
Just like that? I don't think so.

204
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:23,323
I did not destroy Oa.

205
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,284
I simply moved it to another dimension.

206
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,665
It was in my way.

207
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,001
Then could you move it back?

208
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,878
Done.

209
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,091
I can help you on your journey

210
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,885
and your search for meaning.

211
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:49,516
- Help me? Why? - Because that is my purpose.

212
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:51,100
I accept your offer.

213
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:59,609
- Told you we'd beat 'em. - What do you mean, "we?"

214
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,963
We have another guest, Inza.

215
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,491
Would you prepare a place for him?

216
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,591
Of course. Welcome.

217
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,427
Are you alright?

218
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,596
Fine, although there was a moment

219
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,205
when I actually thought John Stewart

220
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,599
was going to attack me.

221
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,726
Oh, I don't know about that.

222
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:37,564
His bark's a lot worse than his bite.
