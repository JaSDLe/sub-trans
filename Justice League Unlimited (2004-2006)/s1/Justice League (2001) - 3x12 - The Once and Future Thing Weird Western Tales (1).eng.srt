1
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>David? David?</i>

2
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,185
Are you hiding in the garage again?

3
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,316
Look at this mess.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,819
Come on out, David. I know you're here.

5
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,488
Oh! Hello, dear.

6
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:33,157
I was just cataloging some of my collection.

7
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,951
Collection? Huh!

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,369
Bunch of junk.

9
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:38,371
It's not junk.

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,498
This comb belonged to Cleopatra.

11
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,709
And this, this is an actual early draft of the Magna Carta.

12
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,294
- And this... - Right.

13
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,823
Like you could afford these things

14
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,006
on a physics professor's salary.

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,050
We can't even afford the new car I want.

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,177
I-I didn't buy them, Enid.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,054
I sort of... took them.

18
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,140
You robbed a museum?

19
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,309
Is that why you're wearing that goofy cat suit?

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,895
<i>Well, sort of. Not exactly.</i>

21
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,944
Remember, last summer when I didn't get tenure?

22
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:06,774
Yeah, they thought you were crazy

23
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,901
because you kept insisting you were on the verge

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,697
of discovering... time travel.

25
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:15,825
It's my chrono suit. I've had it working for months.

26
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,369
I've been using it to gather treasures for my collection.

27
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,246
And you said I was a loser.

28
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:23,916
Let me get this straight.

29
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,961
You've got a suit that lets you travel in time

30
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:30,381
and you've been using it to steal historical trash?

31
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,883
- You stupid little man! - Huh?

32
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,469
You could go back and steal gold and jewels.

33
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,763
You could get stock information from the future.

34
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,141
- We could be rich. - No!

35
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,684
We can't use the suit to do

36
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,561
anything that could change history.

37
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,980
I'm careful to only take things that wouldn't be missed.

38
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:47,898
Like your <i>spine?</i>

39
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,443
Enid, please. Don't talk to me like that. I love...

40
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,237
Mother was right. I should've married Jim Dorman.

41
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,616
<i>He's a very successful lawyer and you are a loser.</i>

42
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:59,201
- 'Always were, always will be.' - But...

43
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,622
You worthless, good-for-nothing, wretched waste of space!

44
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,332
You invent a time machine

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,709
and can't think of anything useful to do with it?

46
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,254
I can think of one thing.

47
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,300
I can use it to get away from you!

48
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,578
By all means...

49
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,829
you first.

50
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,417
Diana's carrying a grudge.

51
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,710
She'll get over it.

52
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,962
How 'bout you. Carrying anything?

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,092
What, Shayera?

54
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,385
We're cool.

55
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,387
We're giving each other our space.

56
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm seeing Vixen now.

57
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:04,558
I'm very happy.

58
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,728
Uh-huh.

59
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,773
Anyway, why are we always talking about my love life?

60
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,401
What's going on between you and Diana?

61
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,528
Nothing. She's a respected colleague.

62
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,071
Uh-huh.

63
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,532
I don't have time to pursue a relationship.

64
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,326
My work is too important to allow any distractions.

65
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,203
Diana's a remarkable woman.

66
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,081
She's a valued friend, she's...

67
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,542
standing right behind me, isn't she?

68
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,752
Don't let that stop you. Keep digging.

69
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,214
<i>Intruder alert. Dormitory, deck A.</i>

70
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,758
<i>Intruder alert. Dormitory, deck A.</i>

71
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:56,777
Who are you?

72
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,362
How did you get in the Watchtower?

73
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,156
You weren't supposed see me.

74
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,994
Stay away! No, no one's supposed to know I was here.

75
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,523
Everybody, okay?

76
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,983
Where are we?

77
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:47,244
Where?

78
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,205
I think the question is when.

79
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,731
I have to confess.

80
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,609
You're about the most colorfully attired individuals

81
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,236
I've ever bushwhacked.

82
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,444
You circus folk?

83
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,281
Not exactly.

84
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,741
I don't care what you are as long as you pay the toll.

85
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,535
Toll?

86
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,662
Welcome to Elkhorn, Oklahoma, ma'am.

87
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,164
This here's is Tobias Manning territory.

88
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,792
You want tribute? Money?

89
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,335
Well, I ain't particular.

90
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,921
That fat gold chain will do just fine.

91
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,216
Unless you got something else you want to give me.

92
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,724
Those are the biggest

93
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,059
slowest bullets I've ever seen.

94
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,020
- You're letting them go? - Hmm?

95
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:39,982
Oh, no.

96
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,073
I was afraid of this.

97
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,783
The "Elkhorn Gazette."

98
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,285
It's either an amazing forgery

99
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:52,693
or it's less than a month old.

100
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,747
- So? - Look at the date.

101
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,291
<i>June 1879.</i>

102
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,793
I have mentioned how much I hate time travel.

103
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,630
If we don't find our sneak thief, we're stuck here.

104
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,466
Let's head for the nearest town. See if we can find him.

105
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,801
We can't go anywhere dressed like this.

106
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,845
No, we can't.

107
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,103
These shoes are killing me.

108
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,064
You fight crime wearing high heels.

109
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,857
High heels that fit.

110
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,609
Aren't you going to put those on, John?

111
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,112
Has the shower been invented yet?

112
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,114
Somebody should tell this guy.

113
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,416
Those empty holsters aren't gonna scare anybody.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,627
You sure you don't want one of these?

115
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:46,006
Positive. Let's ride.

116
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,257
Hiyah!

117
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,190
I'm out.

118
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,819
What's it gonna be, Earl?

119
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:09,071
I'm studying it, Tobias.

120
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,165
My pappy always said

121
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,042
"Faint of heart never filled a flush."

122
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,336
It ain't your pappy's money.

123
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,545
Fold.

124
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:26,880
That leaves you and me.

125
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,133
What are you holding, Mr. Lash?

126
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,844
It'll cost you another $500 to find out.

127
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,178
Call.

128
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,889
<i>Four kings and an ace.</i>

129
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,183
Well, now, that's a might perplexing

130
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,602
seeing as I got four aces and a king.

131
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,523
Well, I've got the gun.

132
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,861
Lot of that going around lately.

133
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,826
Seems like a waste of a good-sized pot.

134
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,412
How about we split it and both walk away?

135
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:02,249
How about I keep it all?

136
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,668
Sounds fair the way you explain it.

137
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,628
That technology's from the future.

138
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,673
Wait. We don't know how things work here yet.

139
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:13,844
Hang him at dawn.

140
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,429
Don't I get a trial?

141
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,639
Sure.

142
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,848
You're guilty.

143
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,268
My town, my rules.

144
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,353
Wait a minute. Can't we talk about this?

145
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:26,106
How about another hand? Double or nothing!

146
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,150
I think we know how things work here now.

147
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,568
We have to help that man.

148
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,570
That's not what we're here for.

149
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,197
Someone's tampering with history.

150
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:36,742
The stakes are much bigger than the life of one card shark.

151
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,369
Then it's settled, we'll break him out after sundown.

152
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:44,750
Chirp chirp chirp

153
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,302
That's not going to work. I tried it.

154
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,346
Yeah, those bars are cheap pig iron

155
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,515
but they're plenty strong enough to hold.

156
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,226
At least until morning when they come to hang you.

157
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,354
Do you mind? I'm trying to plan an escape over here.

158
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,064
How's it going so far?

159
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:08,607
I'm working on it.

160
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,984
Quiet down in there!

161
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,820
That's just what I was telling him!

162
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:26,875
I'll get the door.

163
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,172
Or that.

164
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,383
I'd get out of town if I were you.

165
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,969
I'd like to, but my pappy always said

166
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,657
"A man who sticks his head in the sand

167
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,222
makes a pretty good target."

168
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,308
I got business to conclude before I leave.

169
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,519
Bartholomew Aloysius Lash.

170
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,896
Friends call me Bat, Bat Lash.

171
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,066
I'm John. These are my friends, Diana and, uh...

172
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,776
- Bruce. - We're the lawmen.

173
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,987
Looking to bring a criminal to justice.

174
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,698
You may have seen him. He's got amazing machines.

175
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:00,033
We think the man who put you in here works for him.

176
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,702
Not quite, Wonder Woman.

177
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,203
How do you know who I am?

178
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,873
Because he's the man we're looking for.

179
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:08,375
David Clinton, inventor of the chrono suit

180
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,127
at your disposal.

181
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,546
You tried to steal Batman's utility belt.

182
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,591
And you chased me, but time tunnels

183
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,509
are somewhat counter-intuitive.

184
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,553
Even though you were only seconds behind me

185
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,598
I arrived here nearly six months before you did.

186
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,558
Where's your time travel device?

187
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,185
Now, that's a story.

188
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,562
As soon as I got here, I was robbed.

189
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,855
By Tobias Manning?

190
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,063
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,649
He took my suit and used it

192
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,693
to take over this town.

193
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,403
He keeps taking trips to the future

194
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,572
and coming back with stolen technology.

195
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,074
He keeps me here to teach him how to use the stuff that...

196
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,910
he can't work out for himself.

197
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,120
Which, I'd suspect, is most of it

198
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,247
what with him being so mule-stupid and all.

199
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,334
It's been horrible here. Humiliating!

200
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,585
I just want to go home.

201
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:52,993
I'll gladly take my punishment

202
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,213
if you help me get back.

203
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,797
How did Tobias take over

204
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,382
a whole town with a time machine?

205
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,592
Future tech.

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,094
Like his extra-dimensional six-gun.

207
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,846
And his surveillance cameras.

208
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,642
We need to go, now.

209
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,850
Go with us.

210
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,687
That's a healthy gal.

211
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,826
I've got their position. I'm gonna take 'em down.

212
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,496
Don't hurt anyone. We could accidentally change history.

213
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,498
Little late for that, don't you think?

214
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,168
Go ahead.

215
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,003
Give me an excuse.

216
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,930
Something's happening out there.

217
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,036
Something's happening, alright. The cavalry's arrived.

218
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,904
Who are you people?

219
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,032
Sheriff Ohiyesa Smith.

220
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,076
Ed Diablo, ever at the service of justice.

221
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,911
Jonah Hex.

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,663
Don't have a lot of time for jawing.

223
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,749
In these parts, there's an abundance of bad men

224
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,417
who need setting straight.

225
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,841
If you all are working for Tobias

226
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,593
there's gonna be difficulty.

227
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,261
Easy, Jonah. They're with me.

228
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,590
<i>They helped me out of a spot</i>

229
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:08,847
<i>while I was here incognito</i>

230
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,496
<i>trying to find out more about Tobias.</i>

231
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,767
What have you learned?

232
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,518
Among other moral failings

233
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,479
the man cheats at poker.

234
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,272
Huh! I could've told you that.

235
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,609
Why don't you start from the beginning?

236
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:22,903
I've lived in Elkhorn since the war.

237
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,613
And sheriffed most of that time.

238
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,031
<i>This here's a mining town.</i>

239
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,491
<i>Booming, too.</i>

240
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,979
<i>Folks sometimes get a might rowdy</i>

241
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,117
<i>on payday, but still</i>

242
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,787
<i>it's a good place to live.</i>

243
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,599
<i>There's never been any mischief here</i>

244
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,874
<i>I couldn't handle.</i>

245
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,542
<i>Until about six months ago.</i>

246
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,462
<i>Tobias Manning's always been trouble.</i>

247
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,047
<i>I've run him out of town before.</i>

248
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,636
<i>Well... he came back.</i>

249
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,388
<i>Except this time, he had...</i>

250
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,932
<i>I don't know... magic powers.</i>

251
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,780
<i>There's no such thing as magic, my friend.</i>

252
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,685
<i>It was some sort of trickery.</i>

253
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,163
<i>Well, he tricked me near to death.</i>

254
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,170
<i>He whipped me good.</i>

255
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,715
<i>Ran me out of town like a stray dog.</i>

256
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,300
<i>He took over the town.</i>

257
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,469
<i>Runs it like his own personal kingdom.</i>

258
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,346
<i>Treats the town people like slaves.</i>

259
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,224
That's unacceptable to me.

260
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,017
The sheriff went looking for men

261
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,645
who would help take Tobias down. He found us.

262
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,230
What's your stake in this?

263
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,481
We're lawmen too.

264
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,732
From back East?

265
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,151
Sure.

266
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,153
We came here to bring this man to justice.

267
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,864
Indirectly, he's the source of your trouble too.

268
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,699
Tobias stole a weapon from him.

269
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,742
It's the source of his magic.

270
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,578
We'll need to take that weapon back.

271
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,506
Since we all want pretty much the same thing

272
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,705
we should work together.

273
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,458
I ain't about to turn down help.

274
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,084
What's the plan?

275
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,377
Plan? Huh.

276
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,171
We put him in the ground.

277
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,536
Fancy gun belt you got there.

278
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,955
I'm thinking you folks are time travelers.

279
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,208
Where would you get a crazy idea like that?

280
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,376
Experience.

281
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,545
I've had an interesting life.

282
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,214
We're getting close.

283
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,049
I wanna warn you, there's some downright

284
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:51,593
unusual activity going on hereabouts.

285
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,721
- Don't let it throw you. - Don't worry about it.

286
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,639
We've got a lot of experience with unusual...

287
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,602
I'm sorry. You were saying.

288
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,812
We've been sighted. They'll be ready for us.

289
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,397
I sincerely doubt that.

290
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,312
The shots are spooking the horses.

291
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,064
The shots are spooking me!

292
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,273
No!

293
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,946
Hey, tin horn!

294
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,920
Tobias!

295
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,673
If it isn't pow-wow Smith.

296
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,593
Wasn't expecting to see your sorry hide again.

297
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,096
I've told you before about calling me that.

298
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:24,424
It ain't gonna happen again.

299
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:25,515
No.

300
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,809
I expect this is the last time.

301
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,394
Go for your gun, chief.

302
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,479
So I can ventilate you proper.

303
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,776
Six guns, six of us.

304
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,362
Nobody miss.

305
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,823
My guns!

306
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:44,075
You and me, partner.

307
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,326
Right now.

308
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,662
Another day, lawman.

309
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,871
Nova!

310
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,501
Let him.

311
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,670
The man needs to balance his own accounts.

312
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,981
Have it your way.

313
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,649
Let's finish this.

314
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:29,871
This what you're looking for?

315
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,298
Near as my ring can figure

316
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,067
that's everything that shouldn't be here.

317
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:45,136
Shoot! I wanted me one of 'em fancy ray guns.

318
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,679
Ain't dependable.

319
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,223
They jam.

320
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:51,351
Oh, you forgot to reset the compensator. Here, let me.

321
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,647
Or maybe I'm lying.

322
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,117
Huh.

323
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:15,625
We've been expecting you.

324
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,906
But I bet you weren't expecting us.

325
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,634
Static?

326
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,885
What's going on?

327
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,220
Dad?
