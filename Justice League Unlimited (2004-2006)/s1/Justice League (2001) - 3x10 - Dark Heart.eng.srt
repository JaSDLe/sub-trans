1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,223
So... remind me again why we picked this mesa to climb?

2
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,977
Because once we're up there

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,480
we'll be able to see half of Nevada.

4
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:23,940
That's it?

5
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:25,733
Well, we'll be able to see

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,612
the three towns close to the mesa too.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,657
<i>You</i> are <i>so</i> dumped when we get down from here.

8
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,414
A little help here.

9
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,874
Billy?

10
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:47,964
Rule number one of rock climbing.

11
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:50,007
You never, <i>ever</i> leave your...

12
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,317
<i>This is a priority alert from US Space Command.</i>

13
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,195
<i>We are requesting a rapid response force deployment</i>

14
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,863
<i>from Dulles Air Force Base</i>

15
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,990
<i>to contain and counter</i>

16
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,117
<i>an extra-terrestrial landing.</i>

17
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,452
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

18
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,288
<i>First wave, secure perimeter.</i>

19
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,290
<i>Waves two and three, flank.</i>

20
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,958
<i>Roger that.</i>

21
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>Open fire!</i>

22
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,764
Containment has failed and we are taking heavy losses.

23
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,808
Requesting emergency support.

24
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,060
I repeat, we cannot contain them!

25
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,896
Sounds like the commander could use a little reassurance.

26
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,385
Let's hope we can give it to him.

27
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,667
We'll give it to 'em, alright.

28
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,901
And then some.

29
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,820
<i>Strength in numbers and all that.</i>

30
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,539
<i>It's growing bigger.</i>

31
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,791
It's somehow devouring everything around it

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,376
and converting it into mass.

33
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,045
- <i>Those spider-like things?</i> - The same.

34
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,523
And once they're done with the debris

35
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,147
from the army's attempt to beat them back

36
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,177
<i>they're going to spread out to those three towns.</i>

37
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,886
<i>Diana, I have the communications feed</i>

38
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,263
<i>from the general on the ground. Patching it through.</i>

39
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,307
This is Wonder Woman. Go ahead, general.

40
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,726
This is General Eiling, USAM.

41
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,254
We're in the process of evacuating

42
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:32,188
the three towns in the immediate vicinity.

43
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:34,315
We need those... things locked down.

44
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,567
Then the first task is containment.

45
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,295
I've got something on board that may buy us

46
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,319
a little more time.

47
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,590
- Batman, what was that? - Fermionic gas.

48
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,134
Cools to within a few degrees of absolute zero.

49
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,595
Why would you have something like that on board?

50
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,404
<i>I needed to freeze the Gotham river once.</i>

51
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,555
<i>Long story.</i>

52
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,234
Move in!

53
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,304
Good job. Surround them and close in.

54
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,889
Hold on a second.

55
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,563
They're right under us!

56
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,579
Wonder Woman, can you hear me?

57
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,290
I'm in the town of Goldhanger, two clicks from you.

58
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,258
And we're not gonna get everyone out in time.

59
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>You won't have to, general.</i>

60
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,421
The watchtower is now in stationary orbit over the site.

61
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,048
I'm clearing the binary fusion generator for firing.

62
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,257
The what?

63
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,540
It converts our space station's

64
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,012
entire power output into a single shot.

65
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
It's a gun with the punch

66
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,848
of a small nuclear weapon, general.

67
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:33,851
- You're not serious. - We're <i>very</i> serious.

68
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,519
Now pull your men back.

69
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,008
We can't hit the aliens directly

70
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,664
because it could scatter them for miles.

71
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,858
So we're going to be burning a trench around them.

72
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,570
Fall back! Go!

73
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,306
An hour until we find out if it worked.

74
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,257
That should buy them some time to get the townspeople out.

75
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,397
Now I want to learn about these things.

76
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,414
<i>I think the main space craft is replicating them.</i>

77
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,942
<i>There's some kind of molecular machine inside each of them.</i>

78
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,711
<i>A sort of dark heart building around itself.</i>

79
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,591
We need Ray Palmer in Boston.

80
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,301
Superman, you'll get there fastest.

81
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,303
Agreed. Be right back.

82
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,805
Hold the line.

83
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,852
<i>Professor Palmer, we've lost you off the scanner.</i>

84
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,061
<i>Professor?</i>

85
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,071
Reconfigure for the atometer limit, Katie.

86
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,282
I know he's down here somewhere.

87
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,908
Could be pretty small by now.

88
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,832
And he just found me.

89
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,084
He's bigger than my car now, Katie.

90
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,711
Personally, I blame you.

91
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>How can it possibly be my fault?</i>

92
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,090
Because otherwise it would be my fault.

93
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,967
That can't be right. I'm a professor.

94
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,104
I have the core control, and I can see the problem.

95
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,023
The chemical wash made a bad nanochip.

96
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,775
I can shut him down by...

97
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,615
Okay, I'm just gonna be direct.

98
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,959
<i>Professor Palmer? Professor? Ray!</i>

99
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,545
I'm going to lay here for a while, Katie.

100
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,672
I'm old now, and I get tired.

101
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,134
<i>You have, uh... company, professor.</i>

102
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,678
<i>Serious company.</i>

103
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,347
I'm coming up. Stand by.

104
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,947
Hello, Superman. What brings you to Boston?

105
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,783
Omega level situation.

106
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,427
Katie, please inform the front office

107
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,787
that I'm gonna be, uh, out for a while.

108
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,166
<i>Fifty years ago Dr. John Von Neumann</i>

109
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,168
<i>imagined that self-replicating robots</i>

110
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,962
<i>would be how we'd explore the universe.</i>

111
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,815
<i>Send one robot out, order it to build another ten</i>

112
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,173
<i>wherever it lands.</i>

113
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,634
<i>Another ten are sent out in all directions.</i>

114
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,594
I think we have one of those in Nevada, Ray.

115
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,390
Then we're looking at the big nightmare of nanotechnology.

116
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,350
A machine that can build clones of itself

117
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,561
out of atoms of anything.

118
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,913
What would stop them from building

119
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,438
until everything is gone?

120
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,774
<i>Got an ETA yet? We need you.</i>

121
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,983
Soon.

122
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,360
How's the trench holding up?

123
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,862
What trench?

124
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,744
The was the last of my useful armaments.

125
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,287
I can't do anymore.

126
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:23,742
Batman to all points. I could use some air support.

127
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,286
Since I can't fly... at all.

128
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,706
Now would be good.

129
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,460
The spiders are forcing us back.

130
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,104
And the mother ship is releasing mechanical

131
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,257
attack tigers to protect them. Where's the Atom?

132
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,968
Getting sweaty in here. Is that Batman?

133
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:43,553
Find Wonder Woman and get us down.

134
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,397
This is a losing battle.

135
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,149
We destroy one, the main vessel breeds three more.

136
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,238
Welcome to our nightmare. Can you help?

137
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,657
Look at those. It's amazing.

138
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,413
Ray, tell them what you told me.

139
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,915
These things build copies of themselves

140
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,084
using whatever material is around

141
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,421
and they'll only stop when everything is gone.

142
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,631
So this isn't just about these three towns?

143
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,841
No.

144
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,592
They'll go coast to coast

145
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,094
and then across the seabed.

146
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,556
They'll use rock, metal, plastic, plant life.

147
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,433
- People. - Yes.

148
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:32,060
And destroying the replicated machines isn't enough.

149
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,604
You have to get to the system's core control.

150
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,231
If we destroy the mother ship.

151
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,525
You have to understand, making metal out of rock

152
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,527
is a microscopic process.

153
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,156
The core control is issuing instructions at an atomic scale.

154
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,644
You can't just smash up a machine

155
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,200
the size of an infection.

156
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,452
Leave a crumb of it intact

157
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,162
and it'll start all over again.

158
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,770
You have to get me to the main ship.

159
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:54,041
I have to go inside that thing and reprogram it.

160
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,848
All points, this is Batman. We have a new plan.

161
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,309
We have to get the Atom to the main vessel.

162
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,519
Superman puts him and Wonder Woman there.

163
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,146
Half of us back her up.

164
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,024
Everyone else, we draw a line here.

165
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:22,819
No one is going to die because of us. Go.

166
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,197
- Ready? - Just don't squeeze.

167
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,159
Let's go to work.

168
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,877
We need more cover.

169
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,713
Supergirl, Green Lantern

170
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,242
more air support for Wonder Woman.

171
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,030
I need both hands, Professor Palmer.

172
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,848
Go!

173
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,827
I'm in.

174
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,187
Palmer to Batman.

175
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:04,981
I think I'm almost there. Stand by.

176
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,567
- Wow. <i>- 'What's your status?</i>

177
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,362
This is incredible.

178
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,947
Every atom of it is filled

179
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,615
with a book's worth of information.

180
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:16,993
- It's beautifully simple. It... <i>- 'Save it for the autopsy.</i>

181
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,912
I think I can access it.

182
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,001
I knew it.

183
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,711
<i>It carries its own history.</i>

184
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,130
It copies it into each replicant.

185
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,841
Batman, can you hear me? It's a war machine.

186
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,219
<i>What was your first clue?</i>

187
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,929
<i>Two planets at war.</i>

188
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,057
It's builders launched it at a whole other planet

189
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,933
<i>like a cruise missile.</i>

190
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:45,605
<i>It ate an entire planet.</i>

191
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,108
<i>And it followed its programming.</i>

192
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:51,528
<i>Reproduce, go to the next occupied planet, reproduce.</i>

193
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,989
Maybe this war was fought across the galaxy.

194
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,907
But it doesn't know the war is over.

195
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,201
If I'm reading the symbols right, the original device

196
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,662
was constructed more than 50,000 years ago.

197
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,840
Ray? Ray! Aah!

198
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,967
Batman, I've lost contact. Are you there?

199
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:25,895
Come on, come on! It's here somewhere. I know it.

200
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,655
Yes! The core control.

201
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,080
It won't break. I have no tools. Think.

202
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:47,876
No tools... except this one.

203
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:50,920
Controlling my size and weight. Be direct.

204
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:19,324
<i>Atom, we're about out of time.</i>

205
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,660
- 'What's happening in there?' - It didn't break.

206
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,453
I couldn't break the heart. It...

207
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,996
<i>It what?</i>

208
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,285
I couldn't break the heart.

209
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,458
But I bet I can give it a heart attack.

210
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,336
These arteries are feeding liquefied matter into the heart.

211
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:33,296
If I can interrupt that flow

212
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,341
starve it of matter, build up some pressure.

213
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,278
Come on!

214
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:01,908
Come on!

215
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,206
Ray? Can you hear me? Come in.

216
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,180
There. Is that...

217
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,483
That... was disgusting.

218
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,123
I don't suppose you need any help destroying that.

219
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,126
Wouldn't want that technology falling into the wrong hands.

220
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,878
We can learn a lot from it.

221
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,631
It almost beat the Justice League, after all.

222
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,759
Why would you need something to do that, general?

223
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,092
Oh, I don't know.

224
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,178
Maybe because it turns out the Justice League

225
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,846
has had a secret space-based weapon

226
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,807
of mass destruction all along.

227
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,392
And we're gonna be talking about that someday.

228
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,977
Believe me.

229
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,562
Ma'am.

230
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,281
Amazing.

231
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,250
Show him a weapon that destroyed its creators

232
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,827
and every other thing it saw

233
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:10,411
and he wants to play with it.

234
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,497
What's to stop history from repeating itself

235
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:14,791
right here on Earth?

236
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,042
We are.
