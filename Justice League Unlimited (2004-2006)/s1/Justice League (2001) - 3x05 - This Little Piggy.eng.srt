1
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,011
Patience, princess.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,388
Intergang moves in mysterious ways.

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,723
Tell me about it.

4
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,225
What use could they possibly have

5
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:18,643
for the Rosetta stone?

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,269
We'll find out soon enough

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,478
and in the meantime...

8
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,481
I know... patience.

9
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,201
Don't you ever wish you were down there?

10
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,161
I'm down there all I need to be.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,580
Yes, but it's just a job to you.

12
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,583
I'm talking about going down there and having some fun.

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,253
Maybe... maybe with someone special.

14
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,757
No. No dating for the Batman.

15
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,802
It might cut into your brooding time.

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,681
One, dating within the team always leads to disaster.

17
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,976
Two, you're a princess from a society of immortal warriors.

18
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:03,145
I'm a rich kid with issues... lots of issues.

19
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,982
And three, if my enemies knew I had someone special

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,985
they wouldn't rest until they'd gotten to me through her.

21
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,987
Next.

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,615
There.

23
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,369
Saved by the bell.

24
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,915
Just a common thief.

25
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,375
What happened to Intergang?

26
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,085
J'onn must have gotten a bad tip.

27
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,379
It happens. I'll take the crowbar.

28
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,047
Whatever you say.

29
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>That trick always went over big in Egypt.</i>

30
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,850
Circe. Be careful. She's...

31
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,644
Yeah. I've read "The Odyssey."

32
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,024
That it for you?

33
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:49,609
What are you doing here, witch?

34
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:51,277
You were banished.

35
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:53,029
They needed more space down below

36
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,739
so they paroled me.

37
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,533
Of course, I had to promise to leave your mommy dearest alone

38
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,243
before they'd let me out.

39
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,537
Mother sent her to the pits of Tartarus.

40
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,914
Circe had a nasty habit of turning innocent people

41
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,416
into animals.

42
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm real good at it, too.

43
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,295
So I've read.

44
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:10,823
Let's not give her another chance.

45
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,100
I promised to leave your mother alone, little princess

46
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,770
but nobody said anything about you.

47
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,980
Rest assured, after I get done with you

48
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,399
Hippolyta won't want you for a daughter

49
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,943
and your pointy-eared boyfriend here won't want you

50
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,196
for anything.

51
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,189
My poor assistant. He's fallen all to pieces.

52
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,608
Let's see if I can help him pull himself together.

53
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:03,324
Oops.

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,463
Thank you. You've been a wonderful audience.

55
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,214
And for my final illusion

56
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,592
I'd like to pull a rabbit out of my hat.

57
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,390
Trust me, it isn't as easy as everybody thinks.

58
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,018
Come on, bugs. Where are you?

59
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:38,068
Well, you're not as furry, but you're just as cute.

60
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,364
<i>Kcab ot lamron!</i>

61
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,385
Hmm. A little slow on the switch.

62
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,429
Gotta watch that.

63
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,556
What was it? Some kind of hologram?

64
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,891
Or was it the real thing?

65
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,060
It's called sorcery, Bruce.

66
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,646
Usually, I play it straight, but for the big closer

67
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,898
I throw in a little dazzle.

68
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,150
But enough about my secrets.

69
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,986
What have you been up to?

70
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,197
I haven't seen you in so long.

71
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:26,116
Can we discuss that later? Someone's in trouble.

72
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,952
Who? What kind of trouble?

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,620
Well...

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,669
Ew. Circe, huh?

75
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,421
It was all over the mystic Ethernet that she made parole.

76
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,881
I'll see what I can do.

77
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,262
<i>Lleps eb nekorb!</i>

78
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,770
<i>Anaid, emoceb namuh!</i>

79
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,401
Well, I've given it my best shots.

80
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,779
I guess my powers run a distant second to those of a goddess.

81
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,365
We could call in one of the other lead magicians.

82
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,534
- Dr. Fate, maybe. - No.

83
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,828
I mean, let's keep this between us.

84
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,038
But why? If there's a chance to help Diana

85
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,748
shouldn't we tell everyone and then...

86
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,002
Oh, wait, wait. You and her.

87
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,254
- Are you two... - Just good friends.

88
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:23,382
No. You and I are just good friends.

89
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,551
There's something more between you and Diana.

90
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,761
Well, maybe there was.

91
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:31,974
Don't worry, Bruce.

92
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,893
I'll find a way out of this for her...

93
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,853
and you.

94
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,622
But I'm beginning to think that only Circe

95
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,608
can turn our chubby friend here back into Wonder Woman.

96
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,651
And Lord only knows where she is right now.

Come on, Sid, are you gonna sell me the chimera scale or not?

110
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,994
You know the rules.

111
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,121
The elements of magic always come at a price

112
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,374
and I don't take cash or plastic.

113
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,292
So what do you want?

114
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,002
Hey, is that thing housebroken?

115
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,756
I'll take care of her.

116
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,176
Now, about that final ingredient I need for my locator spell...

117
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,346
It's all yours for one silver good luck fin.

118
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,306
Mid-Ching dynasty, if you please.

119
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,558
What? That is robbery!

120
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,269
What robbery? I'm giving it to you at cost.

121
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,604
It's a total rip.

122
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,231
I could conjure it up for nothing.

123
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,439
Try it.

124
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,608
Chimera scale is all but

125
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,859
impossible to get

126
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,361
by magic or not.

127
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,697
I'm this dimension's only supplier.

128
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,032
Okay. You win.

129
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,242
<i>Esrup raeppa!</i>

130
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,666
Thank you.

131
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,003
We'll be done here soon.

132
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,889
I call upon the spirits of Earth and air

133
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,685
to reveal our enemy and make her whereabouts known.

134
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,271
This invocation works better frontwards than backwards.

135
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,564
Whatever.

136
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,241
Circe, show yourself.

137
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,044
Well, that was a lot of nothing.

138
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,795
Circe's pretty powerful.

139
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,464
If she doesn't want to be found

140
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,382
there's not much anyone can do.

141
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,551
Then, what was the point of all this?

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,303
Give me my coin back.

143
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,638
Sorry, kid. No refunds.

144
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,099
You slimy little...

145
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,226
Zatanna, she's gone.

146
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:27,775
<i>Dnufer.</i>

147
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,235
Hey!

148
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,737
Uh! Whoa!

149
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,199
Well, that's it.

150
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:38,077
From mud hole to sty, we've looked everywhere.

151
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,579
Obviously we haven't, because we haven't found her yet.

152
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,164
Don't get snippy with me.

153
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:43,532
How many other girls would go

154
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,750
this far out of their way

155
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,044
for a cold, insensitive...

156
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,254
- Yo, Bats. - Aah!

157
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,091
Relax. He's one of us.

158
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,301
B'wana Beast. How ya doin'?

159
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,722
My legs are fine as is the rest of me.

160
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,307
- Up here. - Whoa.

161
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,309
She's got the fire of the cheetah in her.

162
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,189
Why are you doing this to me?

163
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,774
Apart from being an expert tracker

164
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,275
he can communicate with animals.

165
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,903
I called him in to help search.

166
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,031
We're looking for a lost pig, pink, about 60 pounds

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,866
wearing two silver bracelets.

168
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,910
It used to be Wonder Woman.

169
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,621
Right on. I'll yank in some of the other guys.

170
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,291
Let's keep the circle small... very small.

171
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,976
Soo-eee!

172
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,195
Ding-dong

173
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,076
Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a pig.

174
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,036
Gladys, it's for you.

175
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,975
Yo, Wonder Pig!

176
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,029
Bats, Beast.

177
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,780
<i>Got a fix on your girl.</i>

178
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,365
Good work.

179
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,804
I'll have her ready for pickup in...

180
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,182
Yeah, look, Bats

181
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,743
I think I might have jumped the gun

182
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,851
when I said I found the pig.

183
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,269
Keep looking.

184
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,038
Zatanna and I are are going after Circe.

185
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,398
How? The locator spell didn't work.

186
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,442
It's time for one of my tricks.

187
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,902
We need a snitch.

188
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,662
Thank you for setting this up.

189
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,374
Please. Your league has done much good in my name.

190
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,293
When you summoned me, how could I refuse?

191
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,544
Here comes our stoolie.

192
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,011
Don't look at her directly.

193
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,527
Medusa, you have a chance to earn leniency...

194
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,404
<i>if</i> you help our visitors.

195
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:03,532
You were Circe's cellmate, weren't you?

196
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,784
Sea girl and me did some time together

197
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,370
back in the pit of eternal torment.

198
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,497
That's where they hang you by your ankles

199
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,417
and weasels come each night to eat your fingers.

200
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,336
They grow back the next day, but trust me

201
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,547
it gets old real quick.

202
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,632
Did she ever mention Hippolyta?

203
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,259
Are you kidding?

204
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,594
"Hippolyta! Hippolyta!"

205
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,346
All the time Hippolyta.

206
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,850
"When I get my hands on her..." Yada yada yada.

207
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,644
That much we know. We're wasting our time.

208
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,189
Wait. Wait. Uh, there was one other thing.

209
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,692
Circe was always saying she wanted to headline

210
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,694
at the amphitheater.

211
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,739
The amphitheater...

212
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,699
on Mykonos, duh!

213
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:47,701
It seems Circe was wicked jealous

214
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:51,079
of her cousins the Sirens and swore she'd some day

215
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,540
get her turn on the bandstand.

216
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,419
Sophocles got his start there. Aristophanes. All the big names.

217
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,629
You know those statues at the entrance?

218
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,922
Mine.

219
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,969
Thank you, Medusa.

220
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,223
And know that you've earned 300 years off your sentence.

221
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,267
Freedom in 4010.

222
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,935
Ring-a-ding-ding.

223
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,778
Uh... there's a small service charge.

224
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,620
When you see Circe

225
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:34,581
tell her I want my curling iron back.

226
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,630
Come on, guys. Help me out, here.

227
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:45,258
Newcomer, silver bracelets, kind of stuck up.

228
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,712
Hey! Get back here!

229
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:49,990
Gotcha! Oh!

230
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,124
That's it.

231
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,546
Soo-eee.

232
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,132
Here, piggie, piggie, piggie.

233
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,142
Have to admit, Medusa does good work.

234
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,852
Too good.

235
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,737
Thank you, thank you.

236
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:31,406
You've all been so kind to me tonight.

237
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,743
You know, my cousins the Sirens never thought I could sing.

238
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,204
Really? They thought they were all that

239
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,414
with their charm the sailors routine.

240
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,083
But I'm showing them, aren't I?

241
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,509
Oh, thank you.

242
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,886
I love you all!

243
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:54,554
Are there any requests?

244
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,098
<i>Stcejbo kcatta ecric.</i>

245
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,975
I'm not sure I know that one.

246
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,357
Insolent trickster!

247
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,400
You dare to strike...

248
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,152
You dare to strike... Ouch!

249
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,655
You dare to strike...

250
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,114
Quit it!

251
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,574
Oh, no!

252
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,089
Well? Defend your mistress.

253
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,897
Here, piggie, piggie.

254
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,108
Sooie!

255
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,211
Say goodnight, pork chop.

256
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,892
Wow. Loose meat.

257
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,101
Hooh!

258
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,146
That'll do, pig.

259
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,273
Good job, boys.

260
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,529
Side of bacon, coming up.

261
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,931
<i>Elbat mrof egac.</i>

262
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,148
You're both beginning to remind me

263
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,484
of Sisyphus after a hard day pushing his boulder

264
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:14,402
up the mountain, but me?

265
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,364
I could keep this up all night.

266
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,992
Wait. It seems that magic <i>always</i> has a price.

267
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,036
And your point is?

268
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,324
What would I have to give to make you lift your spell

269
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,790
on Diana?

270
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:30,168
Well, now you're getting interesting.

271
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:37,676
I want something from you that's <i>very</i> precious.

272
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:42,055
Something you've worked <i>very</i> hard to conceal.

273
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:45,725
<i>Something when gone you can never regain.</i>

274
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,604
<i>Something... so shattering...</i>

Remember when Penguin tried to kidnap that singer?

294
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,962
Ricky what's-his-name?

295
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,171
So?

296
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,840
I spent a month on stakeout.

297
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,676
Must've heard that song a hundred times.

298
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,720
Is there anything you can't do?

299
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,182
There's one thing I've never been very good at.

300
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,226
Saying thank you.

301
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,777
And, truthfully, it's all still pretty much of a blur to me.

302
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,237
Did I miss anything?

303
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:03,696
Not really.

304
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,615
The important thing is you're safe.

305
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,828
Yeah. Of course... that's not the only important thing.
