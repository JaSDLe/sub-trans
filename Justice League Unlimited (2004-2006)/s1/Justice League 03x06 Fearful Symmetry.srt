than ordinary dream logic.

It was inconclusive.

00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,762
You had some nightmares.

47
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,930
These weren't just dreams.

48
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,758
They felt like they really happened.

00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,060
I don't know. I've had some dreams that felt mighty real.

There was this one the other night..

51
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,765
The point is I couldn't live with myself

52
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,520
if I really did what I saw.

53

Now, are you gonna help me or not?

Of course, kid.

But vague memories of a probe

like one of those alien abduction things.

57
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,988
Maybe you've just been hanging out in Kansas too long.

58

Got all the signs of repressed memory.

61

People dream what their minds don't want to remember.

62
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,588
Easier to convince themselves it's all bunk.

63
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,667
Repressed memories of what?

64
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,717
When?

65
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,135
You've been to S.T.A.R labs

66
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,633
treated for injuries there.

67
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,338
Yeah, a few years ago.

68
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,970
When superman was brainwashed and attacked the earth.

69
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,518
I got hurt, and he took me to S.T.A.R for help.

70
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,220
I was in a coma for part of it.

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,726
Meaning there's a gap in time

72
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,103
you can't account for.

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,353
That's when.

74
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,480
Okay, enough. Don't listen to this guy.

75
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,528
Everything's conspiracies with him.

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,026
Not conspiracies.

77

we humans are used to being vulnerable.

130
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,595
But to you, surgery must have seemed

And powerless to defend yourself

133
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,101
it's possible your mind constructed
