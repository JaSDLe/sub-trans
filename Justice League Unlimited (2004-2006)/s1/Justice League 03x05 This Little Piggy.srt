Intergang moves in mysterious ways.

What use could they possibly have

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,640

00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,263
We'll find out soon enough

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,435
and in the meantime--

00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,479
I know...patience.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,195
Don't you ever wish you were down there?

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,151
I'm down there all 1 need to be.

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,578
Yes, but it's just a job to you.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,578
I'm talking about going down there and having some fun.

Maybe...maybe with someone special.

15
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,755
No. No dating for the Batman.

16

It might cut into your brooding time.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,675
One, dating within the team always leads to disaster.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,973
Two, you're a princess from a society of immortal warriors.

And three, if my enemies knew I had someone special

36
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,642
Yeah. I've read "The Odyssey."

37

That it for you?

38

What are you doing here, witch?

39
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,274
You were banished.

40
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,022
They needed more space down below

41
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,728
so they paroled me.

42
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,531
Of course, I had to promise to leave your mommy dearest alone

43

before they'd let me out.

44

Mother sent her to the pits of Tartarus.

45
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,909
Circe had a nasty habit of turning innocent people

46

into animals.

47

No. You and I are just good friends.
