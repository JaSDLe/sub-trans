Whoa! Where'd you get--

182
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,526
One minute, Van.

183
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,024
Something's bothering you.

- I don't see what-- - Something's wrong, dad.

Something's going to happen. I can feel it in--

Do I have to remind you about

00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,999
a certain prediction of my own?

when you were only a few days old?

195
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,008
I announced to the world that

196

Krypton was going to explode

197
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,884
and it took me years to salvage my reputation.

00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,436
But maybe you were right, maybe..

199
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,731
Maybe I've just been working too hard.

200
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,858
The past is dead.

Can we go up to the roof, grandpa?

Somebody wants to see the macroscope.

204
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,280
Go on up with your father, Van.

Van, when you were born

it was the happiest day of my life.

220
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,840
When I first saw your beautiful little face

221
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,048
your tiny fingers squeezed my hand so tight.

222

Like you never wanted to let go.

But I don't think you're real.

00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,110
I don't think any of this is-is real.

Don't say that, daddy.

Please. You're scaring me.

No, no. I don't want to scare you, Van.

You are everything I ever wanted in a son.

This is everything I ever wanted in a life.
