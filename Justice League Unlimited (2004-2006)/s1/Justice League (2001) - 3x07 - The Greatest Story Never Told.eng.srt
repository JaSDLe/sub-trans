1
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>You're safe now, folks.</i>

2
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,225
This hunk of tin and transistors

3
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,936
couldn't cut it against a real high-tech hero.

4
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,938
A hero who's a thousand percent committed

5
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,439
to the fight against evil

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,150
and... and...

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,319
And you have no idea who I am, do you?

8
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:31,572
Skeets.

9
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:39,497
<i>Citizens of Metropolis, behold Booster Gold.</i>

10
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:43,793
<i>Traveling back through time from the year 2462 AD</i>

11
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,505
<i>Booster Gold has come to battle today's wrongdoers.</i>

12
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:52,510
<i>Booster Gold... protecting his past to ensure your future.</i>

13
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,556
- Ohh, hey. - Sheesh.

14
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:58,558
- I'm out of here. - Whatever.

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,773
- Can I have your autograph? - Of course, you can.

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,696
I thought you were Green Lantern.

17
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:16,367
I would like your autograph, sir.

18
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,494
Shut up, Skeets.

19
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,251
Come on, J'onn, you got to put me

20
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,796
on some higher profile missions... Grodd, Darkseid.

21
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,091
Any chance The Joker's planning something supernasty?

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,927
I fail to understand your obsession with fame.

23
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,054
Not fame, megafame!

24
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,349
Much more than, like, your level of fame.

25
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,060
No offense, but you've got a hard-to-pronounce name.

26
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,520
It doesn't stick in the mind.

27
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,649
Now Booster Gold... don't you just love saying it?

28
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,694
That is the attitude that keeps you on the sidelines.

29
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:53,904
You're right. It's not just about fame.

30
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,073
What did you pull down last year before taxes?

31
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,959
J'onn, mayday! We need help down here. Now!

32
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:21,015
- Who is that? - The Dark Lord Mordru.

33
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:23,309
You okay? You sound nervous or something.

34
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:26,562
I have never sensed such malevolent magic in one being.

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,564
Unless Mordru can be defeated

36
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,984
I fear for every living creature on the planet.

37
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,193
Yes!

38
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,074
Captain Atom here. Go ahead.

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,452
Report to Metropolis immediately.

40
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,328
I've got a fire to put out here, J'onn.

41
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,165
<i>We have an Omega level priority situation.</i>

42
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,708
Roger that. On my way.

43
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,587
I heard, J'onn.

44
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,995
<i>You will lead the ground forces</i>

45
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,673
<i>once they're assembled down there.</i>

46
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,341
ETA to Metropolis two minutes.

47
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,760
Lantern out.

48
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,181
Listen up, a second unit will serve

49
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,932
<i>under Green Lantern's command.</i>

50
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,685
<i>When I call your name, report to the transporter.</i>

51
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,396
<i>Hawk and Dove, Star and S.T.R.I.P.E.</i>

52
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,318
Shining Knight, Fire and Ice, Dr. Light, Aztek

53
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,905
Huntress, Vigilante, Elongated man...

54
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,782
Vibe.

55
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,033
Ahe-ahem.

56
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,455
- Booster Gold. - Yes!

57
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:51,499
This is it, Skeets, my big chance.

58
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,834
- If I can take down this mumu... - Mordru.

59
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,795
I take him down, and after that

60
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,838
there's no stopping me and my career.

61
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,965
I have every confidence in you, sir.

62
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,179
- Energize. - Doofus.

63
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,413
Blurk! I hate that thing. Give me a javelin any day.

64
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:42,174
Hawk, Dove, and Vibe, you're with us.

65
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,135
What about me?

66
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,638
I was thinking maybe I'd go out on point.

67
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,183
- Crowd control. - Crowd control.

68
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,727
Who says you don't have a sense of humor?

69
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,355
Crowd control.

70
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,776
Now, wait just a... Got it. Crowd control.

71
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,821
- What about me? - Plastic man's down there.

72
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,573
We don't need two stretchy guys.

73
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,535
Well, don't just stand there, chum.

74
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,453
We've got an important job to do.

75
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:18,669
This way. Remain calm. Watch your step.

76
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,764
"We don't need two stretchy guys."

77
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,641
This is so not fair.

78
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,935
I mean, I realize Plastic Man is in the League, too.

79
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,395
I'm not dissing the guy's skills

80
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,148
but come on, I have it all over that guy.

81
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:43,277
One time, I disguised myself as a vase... for three days.

82
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,362
- No, you didn't. - Okay. Maybe not.

83
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,822
Who'd want to anyway?

84
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,116
But I am a detective, which means I'm like

85
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,410
Plastic Man and Batman rolled into one and...

86
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,912
Is there any chance

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,122
you could stop complaining for five minutes?

88
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,833
Hey, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, my friend

89
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,122
but I'll tell you, I wouldn't help those ingrates now

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,378
if they begged me.

91
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,006
- We need you. - It's about time.

92
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:08,010
- Not you, him. - Squeaky wheel.

93
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,641
Maybe they needed a vase.

94
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,039
Maybe I illuminated the colors in the wrong order.

95
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,999
It doesn't matter what we do here.

96
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,960
The battle is over there.

97
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,337
- We're not helping. - This is untrue.

98
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:47,132
"They also serve who only stand and wait." John Milton.

99
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,218
Oh, yeah? I got one for you.

100
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:52,012
"This stinks." Booster Gold.

101
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,974
Fame and fortune don't come your way

102
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,642
when you're on crowd control.

103
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,562
I disagree. Crowd control can be a rewarding experience, sir.

104
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,771
You'll see.

105
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,073
Superman!

106
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,658
Are you okay?

107
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:16,452
I'm fine.

108
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,497
Get back to crowd control.

109
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,960
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

110
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:33,929
Mister, mister, my aunts are still in the building.

111
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,556
This is it, Skeets.

112
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,933
Hang tight. I'll save your family.

113
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,691
Hello. Ladies, can you hear me?

114
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,112
You can come out now. Booster Gold is...

115
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:04,710
- Here are your ants. - Oh, thank you, Green Lantern.

116
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:08,422
I'm not Green Lantern. I'm Booster Gold.

117
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,592
If I were Green Lantern, my costume would be green

118
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,385
now, wouldn't it?

119
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,096
I have officially hit rock bottom.

120
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,640
Sir, you saved those insects. Yay!

121
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,209
Don't you feel good about yourself?

122
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,311
It's never gonna happen for me, Skeets.

123
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,063
Maybe I just don't deserve it.

124
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,522
Nonsense, sir.

125
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,371
You will get a chance to prove your valor.

126
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,319
I believe adventure is right around the corner.

127
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:32,905
Well, if I'm reading this right

128
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,782
I guess you take the 7 to the "B" line

129
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,470
and that will get you out of the city.

130
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,120
Whoa!

131
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,550
Is there anyone left in the building?

132
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:58,388
I think Dr. Simmons is still in lab 4.

133
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,101
Skeets.

134
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,938
Dr. Simmons, are you here? Dr. Simmons!

135
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,361
She is still alive.

136
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,116
She's beautiful and in distress.

137
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,076
My favorite kind of damsel, ha.

138
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,203
Maybe today wasn't such a waste after all.

139
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,748
Mmm, we're all gonna die.

140
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,251
Hey, I'm not dressed for Halloween.

141
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,378
Booster Gold is a bona fide superhero.

142
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,004
You can't help.

143
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,674
My boss and I, we've been experimenting in the lab

144
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,426
with an alternative energy source to fossil fuels.

145
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:37,928
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

146
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,555
The source isn't entirely stable

147
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:41,363
and requires a tremendous amount of power

148
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,225
to maintain equilibrium.

149
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,435
The fire damaged the containment field.

150
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,938
Dr. Brown got caught in the explosion.

151
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,690
The source is loose now.

152
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,693
It could destroy the world... all worlds.

153
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,988
This is so up my alley. I got this for you.

154
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,573
So where is this source?

155
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:13,088
Supergirl, use your heat vision

156
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,631
to lay down suppression fire.

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,884
Aztek, Huntress, fall back to second position.

158
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,095
Watchtower. Go ahead.

159
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,639
- Uh, J'onn, you got a second? - What is it?

160
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,516
We've kind of got an emergency down here.

161
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,768
I know. Mordru's powers appear to be growing.

162
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,189
No, something else, something terrible, something that could...

163
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,691
<i>Now is not the time to rail against your given assignment.</i>

164
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,068
I'm not! I've got a major situation...

165
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,446
Watchtower out.

166
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:38,906
Okay, J'onn, if you think

167
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,908
I can handle it on my own, I will.

168
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:44,286
Tell Superman I got this one, but he owes me. Ha ha!

169
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:47,331
Booster Gold out. He said I can handle this on my own.

170
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,541
- I hope you're right. - So.

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,084
You're the beautiful scientist.

172
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,462
How do we turn your artificial black hole off?

173
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,923
With this, I hope. It's a gravity inhibitor.

174
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,549
We need to get this around his neck.

175
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,218
It should collapse the black hole

176
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,928
and hopefully save Daniel, as well.

177
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,179
Daniel, huh?

178
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,556
Is he your boyfriend, husband?

179
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,850
No, just friends. We better hurry.

180
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,268
Yes!

181
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,941
Can your little friend there detect gravitic anomalies?

182
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,442
No need.

183
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,781
- Oh, my. - You afraid of heights?

184
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:23,575
No. Why-y-y?

185
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:27,955
Go find a shady spot.

186
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,755
Lantern!

187
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,553
Oh, man. We are so lucky!

188
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,223
All I have to do is pop this collar on Mr. Blackhole

189
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,641
save the world

190
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,409
and then it's champagne and strawberries

191
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,769
for me and the hot doctor.

192
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,487
Sorry.

193
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,844
I thought they didn't have flying cars

194
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,117
in this time period.

195
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,046
Oh, blurk.

196
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,310
Sorry, sorry.

197
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,369
Maybe you should handle this.

198
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,246
- Why me? - You're a doctor.

199
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,498
- I'm a physicist. - Yeah?

200
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,958
Give me the collar.

201
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,835
I'll-I'll take care of this.

202
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,756
So, uh, how are you feeling?

203
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,179
How many fingers am I holding up?

204
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,681
Do something useful!

205
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,434
- I'm here to help, sir. - Am I glad to see you.

206
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,479
I need any data you have on childbirth now.

207
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,772
Scanning.

208
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,399
According to my files, first we boil water

209
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,401
then tear up several clean sheets

210
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,905
preferably ones we no longer wish to use for bedding.

211
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,377
<i>Thank you, Green Lantern!</i>

212
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,890
Tracy, where are you?

213
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,646
This is all my fault, Skeets.

214
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,648
I never should have put her in harm's way.

215
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,650
I mean, Superman wouldn't have done that.

216
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,903
He would have figured this all out by now.

217
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,863
That-a-way, sir.

218
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,915
<i>Help me!</i>

219
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,167
Oh, no!

220
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,697
He's in the subway, sir. He's in the subway!

221
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:49,905
I know.

222
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,954
Ohh. They were right.

223
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,582
Some superhero I turned out to be.

224
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,543
If anyone knew the truth, if she knew the truth...

225
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,422
I've got nothing.

226
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,642
Did you find him?

227
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,519
According to my sensors Dr. Brown

228
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,604
is nearing critical mass.

229
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,276
Come on!

230
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,616
- Daniel! - Tracy, keep back!

231
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,369
I can't control it!

232
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:18,954
Just stay where you are.

233
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,108
Huh! Huhh!

234
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,916
Huh!

235
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,632
- Booster! - Skeets!

236
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,343
No!

237
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,914
- I blew it. - It's not too late.

238
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,375
- I can't do it. - Yes, you can.

239
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,295
- You have to! - Tracy, I'm a fraud.

240
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,088
Do you know why I came back to the past?

241
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,673
It wasn't to fight for justice.

242
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
It was to get rich, be famous.

243
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,928
I was a failure in the future, just like I am here.

244
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,764
I'm not a superhero.

245
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,016
Everything is about to be destroyed forever

246
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:05,101
and where are the other superheroes?

247
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,187
Not here. You are!

248
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:08,755
You're the only one who can do this

249
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,649
so do it!

250
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm so-o-orry.

251
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,573
- You're alive. - Tracy?

252
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,451
You're alright, Daniel. Just take it slow.

253
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,203
I don't feel so good.

254
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,215
Skeets!

255
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,093
My gosh. It was full of stars.

256
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Sorry.

257
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,520
- You okay? - Yeah, you?

258
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,941
I am now. That was pretty... superheroic of you.

259
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,902
Hey, all in a judgment day's work.

260
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,029
Well, see you.

261
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,662
Sir, according to my thermal sensor readings

262
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,789
of Dr. Simmons, you just missed

263
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,875
a prime opportunity to...

264
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,545
Well, I believe the phrase is kiss the girl.

265
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,881
Kissing girls is for heroes, Skeets.

266
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,893
Nice work, Elongated Man.

267
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,854
That was just about the slickest move I've ever seen.

268
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:14,230
Hey, it was a team effort.

269
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,774
I'm just glad I stretched

270
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:18,485
<i>in the right place at the right time.</i>

271
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:22,739
Back to normal, huh?

272
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:25,784
Mordru's magic was nullified when he lost consciousness.

273
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,328
I thought I told you to stay on crowd control.

274
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:31,873
I know, but, there was this... I mean, you wouldn't believe it.

275
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,417
It almost...

276
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,836
Oh, forget it.

277
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,255
You and I are gonna have a little chat later.

278
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:44,719
Looking forward to that.

279
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,596
<i>Excuse me, Green Lantern?</i>

280
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,725
For the last time, I am not Green Lantern!

281
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,479
- My name is... - Just kidding.

282
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,856
I know who Booster Gold is.

283
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,942
So now that I'm not in distress

284
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,154
I was wondering if maybe I was still your kind of damsel.

285
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,324
Because maybe we could have dinner

286
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,326
if you're not busy doing cleanup.

287
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,704
Me? No. I only do crowd control.

288
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,382
Squeaky wheel, buddy, squeaky wheel.
