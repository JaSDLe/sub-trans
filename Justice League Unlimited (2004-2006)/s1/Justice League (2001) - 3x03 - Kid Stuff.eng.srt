1
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,058
This better be worth it, mother.

2
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,392
I mean it.

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,562
If the legends are true, it will be.

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,857
You've been saying stuff like that for, like, centuries.

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,859
Nothing ever changes.

6
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,528
Everything's changed.

7
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,321
Except you, Mordred.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,406
And that's because I want you to still be young

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,950
when I give you your kingdom.

10
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:36,244
I want to be king now!

11
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,539
<i>What's this thing?</i>

12
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:41,749
<i>Another stupid charm?</i>

13
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,170
It's the amulet of first magic.

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,464
The source of all Earthly sorcery.

15
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,884
Hmm. Shiny.

16
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:56,305
Be ready, Mordred.

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,905
At last.

18
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,324
Mordred, give that to me.

19
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,119
Why should I?

20
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:20,454
Silly child, you're not...

21
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,707
Not what? Ready?

22
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,042
Or big enough or old enough?

23
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,586
<i>None of that matters, mother.</i>

24
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:30,214
<i>Cause now, I'm strong enough.</i>

25
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,799
Mordred!

26
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,682
I'll have my kingdom

27
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,851
and without anyone telling me what to do.

28
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,394
I never want to see you

29
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,355
or anyone older than me ever again.

30
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,820
No!

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,828
Complete your English assignments

32
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,664
then read pages six to forty in your math books.

33
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,417
And finish your history reports by tomorrow.

34
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,264
Yay!

35
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,517
How many times do I have to tell you, no snacks.

36
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,895
You won't want to eat your...

37
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,286
What the...

38
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,958
Pound their heads!

39
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,836
Pound your own.

40
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,666
I won't go down easy.

41
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,127
Sure, you will.

42
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,924
Guess that's a wrap.

43
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,343
Sorry. Been hanging out with Flash too much.

44
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,897
It was judgment day

45
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,149
and-and we got sent to the bad place.

46
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,485
The bad place! Uh!

47
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:21,445
Snap out of it, Copper.

48
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,988
Yeah, calm down.

49
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,990
We're probably just in another dimension.

50
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,451
Oh, is that all.

51
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,953
I don't see any children.

52
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,622
That's because a child is responsible.

53
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:34,750
Morgaine Le Fay.

54
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,794
I mean you no harm.

55
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,422
My son Mordred has wrought this treachery.

56
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,717
Banishing all adults to this shadow realm.

57
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,886
Even me, his own mother.

58
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:50,099
And after I spent millennia feeding him, bathing him

59
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:52,184
<i>preparing him to be king.</i>

60
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,978
Where did I go wrong?

61
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,312
You're a sorceress.

62
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,189
Can't you just undo his spell?

63
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,775
No. He's got the amulet of first magic.

64
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,152
He's too powerful.

65
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,321
But if we all work together...

66
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,283
You want us to defeat your own son?

67
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,076
So don't trust me.

68
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,370
Let him rule the world and all your children.

69
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,206
Here we will stay. Forever.

70
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,167
But what can we do? We're stuck here, aren't we?

71
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,128
Not exactly.

72
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,630
The spell only banishes adults.

73
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,966
I don't like where this is going.

74
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,594
It's the only way.

75
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,554
We have to do it.

76
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:35,394
Excellent.

77
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,925
Who-who are you?

78
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,468
I'm your king.

79
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,765
And this... is my kingdom.

80
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,580
To my throne.

81
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,850
This better be temporary.

82
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,062
You sound weird. Whoa. So do I.

83
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,106
I kind of like this.

84
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,314
What's the matter?

85
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,109
I wore glasses as a kid.

86
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,443
Guess I need 'em again.

87
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,657
Whoa! I didn't even try to make these.

88
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,742
- Ha ha! - I hope not.

89
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:18,789
Cool.

90
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,416
Will you stop messing around?

91
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:21,667
We got to find Mordred.

92
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,586
Bet the little punk's in there.

93
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,967
It's not a race.

94
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,563
Next.

95
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,276
My sister's crying.

96
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:48,652
I think she's hungry.

97
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,492
Next.

98
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,006
The Justice Babies.

99
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,677
What are you laughing at, precious?

100
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,762
You.

101
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,306
Mother sent you, huh?

102
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,475
She shouldn't send a boy to do a man's job.

103
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,031
I'll make a laser cannon.

104
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,367
No, a missile launcher.

105
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:19,910
Oh! Oh! I know!

106
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,954
Just pick something.

107
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,331
Huh!

108
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,576
You okay, tough guy?

109
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,619
Let go. I'm fine.

110
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,206
That's not fair.

111
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,419
Get him!

112
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,550
Play time's over.

113
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:18,719
You'll share the fate of all my enemies...

114
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,095
execution.

115
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,129
What did he do to the demon?

116
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,338
Etrigan?

117
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,431
Don't hurt him!

118
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,183
Tell him that.

119
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:26,787
Etrigan, cut it out!

120
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,087
Etrigan, you stop right there!

121
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,463
I mean it!

122
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,048
You naughty monster!

123
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,633
Bad, bad Etrigan!

124
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,682
Hey, little guy, it's okay.

125
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,890
I won't hurt you.

126
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,316
You've got to be kidding.

127
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,567
He's just a baby.

128
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,155
That's all he needed.

129
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,534
Aw, man, that ain't all he needs.

130
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,995
Now, that is a job for Superman.

131
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,580
I'm gonna go punch our way out of here.

132
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,999
I'll help.

133
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,856
Now, that's what I call fun.

134
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,441
Come on.

135
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,239
You two, knock it off.

136
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,448
What are you gonna do?

137
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,533
You're just a kid.

138
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,620
I'm the kid with laser beams coming out of his eyes.

139
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,921
That's enough!

140
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,595
You can't tell us what to do!

141
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,513
You're not our mom.

142
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,015
No, but I promise you

143
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:11,975
we will find all your moms

144
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,310
and I'm gonna tell.

145
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,106
Well, what shall we do?

146
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,567
Go outside and wait for your parents.

147
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,943
Now.

148
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,662
Your girlfriend sure is bossy.

149
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,706
Shut up.

150
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,680
<i>He's almost asleep.</i>

151
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,140
We can take him.

152
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,268
I'll make a lawnmower and chew him up.

153
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,563
I say we get that amulet away from him first.

154
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,565
We'll split up and sneak behind him.

155
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,109
Then Lantern can do his thing.

156
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,860
But no mowers.

157
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,530
- Why? - Because it's stupid.

158
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,532
I guess I'll go with Clark.

159
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,367
Unless I should go with you.

160
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:11,618
Whatever.

161
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,161
I'm fine to go with Diana.

162
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,746
So Bruce and I are good to go?

163
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,331
I changed my mind.

164
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,750
I'll go with Bruce, and John can go with Clark.

165
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,169
Whatever.

166
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,379
What's with them?

167
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,089
Man, for somebody with, like

168
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:25,882
fifty different kinds of vision

169
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,384
you are so blind.

170
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:29,635
What?

171
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,406
Easy.

172
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,534
- Whatcha doin'? - Huh?

173
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:54,743
Mother?

174
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,912
Get the amulet!

175
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,588
He's just a little kid!

176
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,801
Man, I hate magic!

177
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,101
Now who's little?

178
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:36,745
Come on!

179
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,518
Come out of my castle!

180
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,604
Your king commands it! Uh!

181
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,939
I got a plan!

182
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:47,649
I'll make some giant handcuffs and...

183
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:48,858
Forget it!

184
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,735
We've got to focus on...

185
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,114
never mind what I just said.

186
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,383
We'll take care of everything else.

187
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,242
<i>Lantern, you go crazy.</i>

188
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,998
<i>Hey, junior!</i>

189
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,043
How about picking on somebody your own size?

190
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,549
You're so dead.

191
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:38,116
Thought you could beat me in that piece of junk?

192
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,493
Wasn't really trying.

193
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,702
- Treachery! - Uh!

194
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:46,915
Hah!

195
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:00,722
No!

196
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,240
Nice try.

197
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,243
But I already absorbed too much of the amulet's power.

198
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,664
- Uh... - Ah!

199
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,214
Now, I'll take care of my kingly duty myself.

200
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:36,298
What?

201
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,884
I'm scared.

202
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,552
I want my mommy.

203
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,179
You don't need a mommy.

204
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,932
You're better off without one. Trust me.

205
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,269
Stop it!

206
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,478
Stop it!

207
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,025
<i>- Some king. - I'm not impressed.</i>

208
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,985
What'd you expect?

209
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,405
He's a boy doing a man's job.

210
00:19:58,613 --> 00:19:59,823
You don't know what it's like

211
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,866
being stuck as a kid.

212
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,576
Since you've got all that power

213
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,870
<i>you could have been a man anytime you wanted.</i>

214
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,747
<i>I think you're too chicken to grow up.</i>

215
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,874
Yep, big chicken.

216
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,126
That's what you are.

217
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,419
Face it, precious.

218
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:15,046
You like being a little mama's boy.

219
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,297
I'll show you.

220
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,882
I'll show you all!

221
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:39,070
I'm older than you now.

222
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,740
You sure are.

223
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,325
What? Wait. No!

224
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,039
They cheated.

225
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,667
After I fix this, they're toast!

226
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,835
What's wrong with me?

227
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,254
Where's my power?

228
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,506
You've used it all.

229
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,341
Don't you realize what you've done?

230
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,844
What?

231
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:04,846
What?

232
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,230
Mom! Ha ha!

233
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,830
A bargain is a bargain.

234
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,175
Mommy.

235
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,683
Wait. What happened to Mordred?

236
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,186
My spell gave him eternal youth

237
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,188
but now that he's broken it

238
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,524
all he has is eternal life.

239
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,577
Circumstances aside...

240
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,289
It was kind of enjoyable to be a kid again.

241
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,084
I haven't been a kid since I was eight years old.

242
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,598
Did you miss mommy?

243
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,058
Well, don't you worry, baby.

244
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,728
Mommy's going to take good care of you...

245
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,939
from now on.
