353
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,119
That's what you are.

354
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,416
Face it, precious.

355
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,040
You like being a little mama's boy.

356
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,291
I'll show you.

357
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,872
I'll show you all!

358
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,005
swoosh

359
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,755
[cooing]

360
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,060
I'm older than you now.

361
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,738
You sure are.

362
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,316
What? Wait. No!

363
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,034
They cheated.

364
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,661
After I fix this, they're toast!

365
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:54,792
What's wrong with me?

366
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,244
Where's my power?

367
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,501
You've used it all.

368
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,332
Don't you realize what you've done?

369
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,834
What?

370
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,839
What?

371
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,841
[crying]

372
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,224
Mom! Ha ha!

373
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,182
[instrumental music]

374
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,820
A bargain is a bargain.

375
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,247
swoosh

376
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,173
Mommy.

377
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,249
'Oof!'

378
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,678
Wait. What happened to Mordred?

379
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,180
My spell gave him eternal youth

380
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,181
but now that he's broken it

381
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,513
all he has is eternal life.

382
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,321
[laughing]

383
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,567
Circumstances aside..

384
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,280
It was kind of enjoyable to be a kid again.

385
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,082
I haven't been a kid since I was eight years old.

386
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,715
[thunder rumbling]

387
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,589
Did you miss mommy?

388
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,048
Well, don't you worry, baby.

389
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,727
Mommy's going to take good care of you..

390
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,929
...from now on.
