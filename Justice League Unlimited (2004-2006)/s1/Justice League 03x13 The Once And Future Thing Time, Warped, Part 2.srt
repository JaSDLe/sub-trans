and can't think of anything useful to do with it?

You tried to steal Batman's utility belt.

Don't hurt anyone. We could accidentally change history.

We're all that's left of the league.

You've traveled about 50 years into your future.

Last time I saw you, you were too young to drive.

We lost a lot of good people that day.

98

You mean, Superman, J'onn, all the others?

Yeah. You too.

00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,359
I'm more surprised that I lived so long.

Batman, Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne, Batman.

106
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,574
Or have you met?

107
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,947
- Not now. - Not now.

108
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,493
Great. What did they used to call it?

109
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,821
Stereo?

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,496
This is a little weird for everybody.

111
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm Warhawk, Rex Stewart.

112
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,876
Your mother. Who is she?

113
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,920
Kind of obvious, don't you think?

114
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,123
Even if it isn't, leave it be.

115
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,083
You don't wanna know too much about your future.

116
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,089
Trust me, you really don't.

117
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,467
Shayera was one cranky pregnant lady.

118
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,014
Although, to be fair, if I'd laid an egg that size.

119
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,762
He's kidding, dad.

120
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,139
Not that I understand why you think

121
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,844
'this is anything to joke about.'

122
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,431
Because we already won. Think about it.

123
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,106
If old Bruce is here

124
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,684
that means he already lived through this as Batman.

125
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,269
Flawless logic.

126
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,150
Except that I have no memory of ever going to the future

127
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,481
and meeting my older self

128
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,738
or of anything else that's happening today.

129
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,069
Those historical buildings we saw on the street.

130
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,700
The timeline's been polluted.

131
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,705
So polluted that history itself is becoming fluid.

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,410
We'd better compare notes.

133
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,920
Enid, I have to say that I'm vexed.

134
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,174
Yes, vexed is precisely the word for it.

135
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,676
You shouldn't let yourself get upset, David.

136
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,054
You're right, dear.

137
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,306
But here we are.

138
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,512
Now, look at it from my point of view.

139
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,269
I go to the trouble of taking over the whole city

140
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,943
so I have a nice place to keep my collection.

141
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,272
And it's a beautiful collection, David.

142
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,357
I was gonna say the same thing, boss.

143
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,819
For instance, this is a really nice boat. Big!

144
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,450
Don't patronize me, Chucko

145
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,998
and especially, don't interrupt me.

146
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,951
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,707
Sorry what?

148
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,084
Everybody?

149
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,461
(in unison) Sorry, Lord Chronos!

150
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,339
It doesn't seem right. I go to the future.

151
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,672
I get the technology that gives you all your new super powers.

152
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,757
I let you run amuck in my town

153
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,935
in return for the occasional security job

154
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,478
and what do you do in return?

155
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,022
(both) 'Um..'

156
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,816
Rhetorical.

157
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,314
My point is, I give you an easy job.

158
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,443
Take care of Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern.

159
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,524
It should have been ten minutes work.

160
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,824
But the JLU showed up.

161
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,401
They got in our way.

162
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,203
Yes, they did.

163
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,201
And the question arises

164
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,703
who told them where

165
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,579
and when our targets would arrive?

166
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,581
I mean, I told you

167
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,789
and I only know because I'm the undisputed master

168
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,875
of space and time.

169
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,550
I'll look into it, boss.

170
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,378
I'll find out where the leak was.

171
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,964
No, don't trouble yourself, Chucko.

172
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,924

Yes, he is.

Chucko, Chucko, Chucko.

178
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,709
You've been a very bad clown.

179
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,016
Enjoy your stay.

Uh, no, sir.

00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,875
Well, Chucko does.

189
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,458
And unless you want to find out firsthand

190
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,963
you'll go finish off the Justice League.

Skedaddle!

192
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,338
Time is money.

193
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,217
Actually, time is the non-spatial continuum

194
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,597
in which events occur linearly

195
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,395
usually in the direction of increased entropy.

196
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,099
But the clowns seem to relate better to the money thing.

Oh, Enid, look at what I've done.

199
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,105
And you always said I wouldn't amount to anything.

200
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,656
I guess I showed you.

[both laughing]

202
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,365
Now, I've taken over Gotham

203
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,368
which gives me plenty of space to store my antiques.

204
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,699
Did you notice I took that stuff out of the garage?

205
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,580
You can park there now if you want to.

206
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,457
Thank you, David.

207
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,041
David, didn't you tell me it was dangerous

208
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,217
to take important things from the past?

209
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,716
That it could damage time somehow?

210
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,548
Don't you think I can handle it?

211
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,633
O-of course I do.

212
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,058
- Dear? - Hmm?

213
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,231
Do you know what would make me happy?

214
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,560
If you let my mother out of the thing like you promised.

215
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,645
We'll see. Rub my neck.

216
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,325
It's just that it seems cruel to keep her there so long.

217
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,278
Your mother was the one who always said

218
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,204
I'd never amount to anything.

219
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,657
And you agreed with her.

220
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,369
Whatever I do, whatever I accomplish

221
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,920
it'll never be enough for you, will it?

222
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,964
I just wanted you to love me.

223
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,668
I'm sick of this! I'm sick of you!

224
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,173
Wait, baby, please.

225
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,005
Isn't there anything I can do to make things right?

226
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,181
I sincerely doubt it.

227
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,772
We still don't know much about him.

228
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,940
Obviously, he's a time traveling warlord.

229
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,438
He's littered the streets with buildings.

230
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,269
He's stolen from other time periods.

231
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,603
He's not a warlord.

232
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,234
At least, he wasn't at first.

233
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,906
When we chased him to the old west

234
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,280
all he was stealing was historical trinkets.

00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,993

If we can get close enough to upload it.

(Wonder Woman) 'If we can get our hands on the belt'

245

maybe we can stop any of this from ever happening

246
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,473
in the first place.

247
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,596
We could even undo the death of your friends.

Diana!

She never left the island.

250
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,479
Or she was never born.

Time is running out.

00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,691
Literally.

253
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,078
We need to find Chronos.

254
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,409
How? He could be anywhere.

He contacts us.
