These folks live in poverty.

And when you have so little

177
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,803
it's easy to be swayed into blaming your neighbor.

178
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,473
Almost all aggression can be cured with education.

179

Yeah?

180
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,592

You pulled us right out of battle.

She just saved our lives, Hank.

209

Two yards would have done that.

This is what's called a retreat.

There was no point continuing.

We were having no effect on that thing.

If anything, it was getting stronger.

There's got to be a way to stop this war.

Unless, you want to just kidnap 'em and make 'em talk.

At least it'll buy me some time.

222
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,263
Why? What are you doing?

223
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,264
I've got to see a man about a suit of armor.

224
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,313
You let them go.

225
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,560
Why didn't you push ahead

226
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,062
and take their camp?

227
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,814
They have enough arsenal there to launch

228
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,986
an assault against the capital.

229
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,485
I have no designs on the capital.

230
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,317
We won, Mr. Sera.

231
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,571
The animals attacked

232
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,277
and we ran them out of town.

233
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,908
I didn't give you the Annihilator

234
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,115
so you could run your enemies out of town.

235
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,950
I gave you the Annihilator

236
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,831
so you could annihilate them!

237
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,583
Forgive the insult, sir.

238
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,710
But you think like a South Kaznian.

'to keep our land.'

242
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,555
Perhaps I could take their camp

243
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,302
but the price would be too great.

244
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,135
Shall I win a country but massacre my people?

245
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,765
Yes, you idiot!

246
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,813
I think like a South Kaznian?

247
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,311
Has it even entered your skull

248
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,188
that they think like South Kaznians?

249
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,645
And you better start thinking that way too

250
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,355
if you want there to be a northerner left

251
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,942
in this rat-infested dirt heap you call a country.

252
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,402
All any of you mortals are good for

253
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,407
is to slaughter one another.

254
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,035
To fight and fight, until the bones of your enemies

255
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,162
are strewn across the battlefield!

256
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,960
Only to rise again

257
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,253
'in the next generation'

258
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,251
'like a well-tended crop.'

259
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,377
That's what the Annihilator is for.

260
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,802
But no-o-o.

261
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,426
You're using it to play tag.

262
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,846
You know what?

263
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,894
You're crazy and I wash my hands of you.

264

I'll thank you to get out of

265
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,436
my rat-infested dirt heap now.

266
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,016
And you can take your robot with you.

267
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,070
Better idea.

268
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,272
I stay.

00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,408
I made that armor for your mother.

272
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,539
Did she ever thank me?

273
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,870
No.

274
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,921
I love your mom

275
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,543
but she didn't have your build.

276
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,502
I didn't come here to talk about my armor.

277
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,507
There's an armored suit fighting in Kaznia

278
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,885
that needs no wearer and bears your mark.

279
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,591
The Annihilator.

280
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,267
Then you did make it.

281
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,392
Who else does such fine work?

282
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,018
Ares liked it.

283
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,065
Ares.

00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,141
Of course.

285
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,944
How do you stop it?

00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,236
Aww.

287
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,485
You knew to ask.

288
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,486
I do leave a small weakness

289
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,739
in each of my creations.

290
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,492
An Achilles' heel, if you will.

291

And what's the Annihilator's weakness?

you'll never figure it out.

Lay down your arms.

You're being used.

Have a nice day.

Our arsenal..

00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,839
You must stop this.

00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,792
I must do nothing.

361
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,503

Lower your weapons!

You don't have a chance like that

367
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,669
so try it my way!

368
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,713
Lower your weapons!

Don!

Let go of me.

He's weak.

00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,392
He'll get himself killed.

Anybody want to give me a clue what just happened?

Sometimes it takes more strength

380
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,721
not to fight.

381
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,106
What's the matter with you people?

Keep fighting!

Give it up, Ares.

Doesn't this prove exactly

00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,551
what I've been saying for years?

398
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,932
Couldn't tell you.
