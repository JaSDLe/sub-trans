This hunk of tin and transistors

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,926
couldn't cut it against a real high-tech hero.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,931
A hero who's a thousand percent committed

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,433
to the fight against evil

7
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,141

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,317
And you have no idea who I am, do you?

- Ohh, hey. - Sheesh.

15
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,551
- I'm out of here. - Whatever.

16
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,764
- Can I have your autograph? - Of course, you can.

17
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,687
I thought you were Green Lantern.

18
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,356
I would like your autograph, sir.

19
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,488
Shut up, Skeets.

20
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,244
Come on, J'onn, you got to put me

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,794
on some higher profile missions...Grodd, Darkseid.

22
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,089
Any chance The Joker's planning something supernasty?

23
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,918
I fail to understand your obsession with fame.

24
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,048
Not fame, megafame!

25
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,347
Much more than, like, your level of fame.

26
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,051
No offense, but you've got a hard-to-pronounce name.

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,510
It doesn't stick in the mind.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,644
Now Booster Gold...don't you just love saying it?

29
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,692
That is the attitude that keeps you on the sidelines.

30
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,894
You're right. It's not just about fame.

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,071
What did you pull down last year before taxes?

- Who is that? - The Dark Lord Mordru.

36
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,306
You okay? You sound nervous or something.

37
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,556
I have never sensed such malevolent magic in one being.

38
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,558
Unless Mordru can be defeated

39
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,983
I fear for every living creature on the planet.

Yes!

Report to Metropolis immediately.

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,322
I've got a fire to put out here, J'onn.

(J'onn) 'We have an Omega level priority situation.'

Roger that. On my way.

49
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,576
I heard, J'onn.

This is it, Skeets, my big chance.

65
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,824
- If I can take down this mumu-- - Mordru.

66
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,785
I take him down, and after that

67
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,836
there's no stopping me and my career.

68
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,959
I have every confidence in you, sir.

What about me?

76
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,632
I was thinking maybe I'd go out on point.

Crowd control.

00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,775
Now, wait just a.. Got it. Crowd control.

- What about me? - Plastic man's down there.

We don't need two stretchy guys.

Well, don't just stand there, chum.

We've got an important job to do.

This is so not fair.

89
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,933
I mean, I realize Plastic Man is in the League, too.

90
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,385
I'm not dissing the guy's skills

91
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,142
but come on, I have it all over that guy.

92
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,271
One time, I disguised myself as a vase...for three days.

- No, you didn't. - Okay. Maybe not.

Who'd want to anyway?

95
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,114
But I am a detective, which means I'm like

96
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,408
Plastic Man and Batman rolled into one and--

97
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,906
Is there any chance

98
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,112
you could stop complaining for five minutes?

99
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,824
Hey, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, my friend

100
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,000
but I'll tell you, I wouldn't help those ingrates now

101
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,372
if they begged me.

102
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,000
- We need you. - It's about time.

103
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,004
- Not you, him. - Squeaky wheel.

104
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,639
Maybe they needed a vase.

It doesn't matter what we do here.

The battle is over there.

Fame and fortune don't come your way

when you're on crowd control.

118
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,560
I disagree. Crowd control can be a rewarding experience, sir.

(female) I'm fine.

00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,487
Get back to crowd control.

This is it, Skeets.

Hang tight. I'll save your family.

I'm not Green Lantern. I'm Booster Gold.

136
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,589
If I were Green Lantern, my costume would be green

137

now, wouldn't it?

138
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,087
I have officially hit rock bottom.

139
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,638
Sir, you saved those insects. Yay!

140
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,181
Don't you feel good about yourself?

141

It's never gonna happen for me, Skeets.

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,056
Maybe I just don't deserve it.

143
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,512
Nonsense, sir.

144
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,222
You will get a chance to prove your valor.

145
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,309
I believe adventure is right around the corner.

146
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,895
Well, if I'm reading this right

147
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,775
I guess you take the 7 to the "B" line

148
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,402
and that will get you out of the city.

Dr. Simmons, are you here? Dr. Simmons!

157

She is still alive.

158

She's beautiful and in distress.

My favorite kind of damsel, ha.

160
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,196
Maybe today wasn't such a waste after all.

Mmm, we're all gonna die.

Hey, I'm not dressed for Halloween.

163

Booster Gold is a bona fide superhero.

You can't help.

with an alternative energy source to fossil fuels.

167
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,922
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

168
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,549
The source isn't entirely stable

169
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,254
and requires a tremendous amount of power

170
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,215
to maintain equilibrium.

171
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,425
The fire damaged the containment field.

172
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,932
Dr. Brown got caught in the explosion.

173
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,684
The source is loose now.

174
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,687
It could destroy the world... all worlds.

175
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,985
This is so up my alley. I got this for you.

176
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,562
So where is this source?

177
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,085
Supergirl, use your heat vision

178
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,629
to lay down suppression fire.

179
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,878
Aztek, Huntress, fall back to second position.

180
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,128
[beeping]

181
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,085
Watchtower. Go ahead.

182
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,637
- Uh, J'onn, you got a second? - What is it?

183
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,510
We've kind of got an emergency down here.

184
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,763
I know. Mordru's powers appear to be growing.

185
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,187
No, something else, something terrible, something that could--

186
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,685
'Now is not the time to rail against your given assignment.'

187
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,063
I'm not! I've got a major situation--

188
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,440
Watchtower out.

189
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,895
Okay, J'onn, if you think

190
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,901
I can handle it on my own, I will.

191
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,280
Tell Superman I got this one, but he owes me. Ha ha!

192
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,328
Booster Gold out. He said I can handle this on my own.

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,531
- I hope you're right. - So.

194
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,082
You're the beautiful scientist.

195
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,456
How do we turn your artificial black hole off?

196
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,912
With this, I hope. It's a gravity inhibitor.

197
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,543
We need to get this around his neck.

198
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,215
It should collapse the black hole

199
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,917
and hopefully save Daniel, as well.

200
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,172
Daniel, huh?

201
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,550
Is he your boyfriend, husband?

202
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,848
No, just friends. We better hurry.

203
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,266
Yes!

204
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,718
[siren wailing]

205
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,934
Can your little friend there detect gravitic anomalies?

206
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,436
No need.

207
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,771
- Oh, my. - You afraid of heights?

208
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,573
No. Why-y-y?

209
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,948
Go find a shady spot.

210
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,753
Lantern!

211
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,875
Ohh!

212
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,544
Oh, man. We are so lucky!

213
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,221
All 1 have to do is pop this collar on Mr. Blackhole

214
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,638
save the world

215
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,386
and then it's champagne and strawberries

216
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,763
for me and the hot doctor.

217
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,727
Ohh!

218
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,477
Sorry.

219
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,821
I thought they didn't have flying cars

220
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,114
in this time period.

221
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,658
[vehicle honking]

222
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,044
Oh, blurk.

223
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,308
- Ohh! - Sorry, sorry.

224
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,686
[female screaming]

225
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,227
Uh-oh.

226
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,653
[panting]

227
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,359
Maybe you should handle this.

228
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,240
- Why me? - You're a doctor.

229
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,493
- I'm a physicist. - Yeah?

230
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,948
Give me the collar.

231
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,829
I'll-I'll take care of this.

232
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,754
So, uh, how are you feeling?

233
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,751
Aah!

234
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,173
How many fingers am I holding up?

235
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,675
Do something useful!

236
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,428
- I'm here to help, sir. - Am I glad to see you.

237
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,476
I need any data you have on childbirth now.

238
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,769
Scanning.

239
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,393
According to my files, first we boil water

240
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,395
then tear up several clean sheets

241
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,899
preferably ones we no longer wish to use for bedding.

242

[baby crying]

243

Ohh. Ohh.

(lady) 'Thank you, Green Lantern!'

245
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,881
Tracy, where are you?

246
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,640
This is all my fault, Skeets.

247
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,641
I never should have put her in harm's way.

248
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,643
I mean, Superman wouldn't have done that.

249
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,897
He would have figured this all out by now.

250
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,857
That-a-way, sir.

251
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,909
(Tracy) 'Help me!'

00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,165
Oh, no!

[Tracy groaning]

00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,498
Aah! Ahh!

[grunting]

He's in the subway, sir. He's in the subway!

00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,132
Unh! Unh!

259
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,945
Ohh. They were right.

260
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,576
Some superhero I turned out to be.

261
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,533
If anyone knew the truth, if she knew the truth..

262
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,420
I've got nothing.

00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,632
Did you find him?

264
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,512
According to my sensors Dr. Brown

265
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,594
is nearing critical mass.

- Daniel! - Tracy, keep back!

I can't control it!

Just stay where you are.

Ohh.

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,912
- I blew it. - It's not too late.

- I can't do it. - Yes, you can.

- You have to! - Tracy, I'm a fraud.

Do you know why I came back to the past?

287
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,663
It wasn't to fight for justice.

288
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,874
It was to get rich, be famous.

289
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,926
I was a failure in the future, just like I am here.

290
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,754
I'm not a superhero.

291
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,010
Everything is about to be destroyed forever

292
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,091
and where are the other superheroes?

00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,177
Not here. You are!

You're alright, Daniel. Just take it slow.

- You okay? - Yeah, you?

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,940
I am now. That was pretty... superheroic of you.

Hey, all in a judgment day's work.

311
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,023
Well, see you.

312
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,656
Sir, according to my thermal sensor readings

313
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,783
of Dr. Simmons, you just missed

314
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,865
a prime opportunity to..

315
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,543
Well, I believe the phrase is kiss the girl.

316
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,871
Kissing girls is for heroes, Skeets.

317
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,890
Nice work, Elongated Man.

318
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,844
That was just about the slickest move I've ever seen.

319
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,224
Hey, it was a team effort.

320
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,771
I'm just glad I stretched

00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,475
'in the right place at the right time.'

Back to normal, huh?

324
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,781
Mordru's magic was nullified when he lost consciousness.

325
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,325
I thought I told you to stay on crowd control.

326
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,871
I know, but, there was this.. I mean, you wouldn't believe it.

327
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,414
It almost..

328
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,834
Oh, forget it.

329
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,253
You and I are gonna have a little chat later.

- My name is-- - Just kidding.

334
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,850
I know who Booster Gold is.

335
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,932
So now that I'm not in distress

336
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,145
I was wondering if maybe I was still your kind of damsel.

337
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,322
Because maybe we could have dinner

338
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,320
if you're not busy doing cleanup.

339
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,699
Me? No. I only do crowd control.

340
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,372
Squeaky wheel, buddy, squeaky wheel.

341
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,337
