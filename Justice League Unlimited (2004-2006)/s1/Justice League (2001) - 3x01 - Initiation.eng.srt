1
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,275
Everybody down!

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,527
Down!

3
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,470
Come on! That's not gonna do us any good now.

4
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,307
I'll sure feel better.

5
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,397
But it'll make me a little cranky.

6
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,787
Well, well, the great and glorious Green Lantern.

7
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,956
What, did you run out of alien menaces to beat on?

8
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,833
You gotta horn in on my turf?

9
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,418
You're welcome.

10
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,211
We never heard back from you.

11
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,588
Been kind of busy.

12
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,190
Someone's gotta keep the streets safe

13
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,609
while you and your pals are out there...

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,153
- Ready. - zipping around the galaxy...

15
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,890
grandstanding and...

16
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,310
Glad you could make it.

17
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,233
And where am I, exactly?

18
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,526
Among friends.

19
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,351
Each of you brings something different to the table.

20
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,605
Strength, speed, stealth, whatever.

21
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,525
<i>But we're all equal in at least one way.</i>

22
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,153
<i>Each of us is willing to make the sacrifices</i>

23
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,696
<i>a hero needs to make.</i>

24
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,282
Even the ultimate one.

25
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,908
Since there are so many of us

26
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,577
we have a chance to do more

27
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:08,247
than just put out fires, both literal and figurative.

28
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,124
<i>We can be proactive.</i>

29
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,251
<i>We can do some real good in the world.</i>

30
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,980
<i>But we're gonna have to be organized.</i>

31
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,964
J'onn'll be up here, keeping an eye on everything.

32
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,759
<i>He'll be the one to decide who's going where and when.</i>

33
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,361
<i>I know a lot of you are used to making</i>

34
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,970
<i>those decisions for yourself.</i>

35
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,348
<i>But from now on, we have to be more coordinated than that.</i>

36
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,726
We can't be cowboys anymore.

37
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:29,934
Or cowgirls.

38
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,689
Ha ha ha...

39
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,024
We sent The Lantern for you

40
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,026
because you never gave us an answer.

41
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,069
Come on, I don't belong up here.

42
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,614
Fighting monsters and aliens and super villains.

43
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,324
I just help the little guy.

44
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:44,992
And a big club like this?

45
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,827
You tend to forget all about him.

46
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,205
So, gee whiz, I'm flattered to be asked and all

47
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:51,749
but, no, thanks.

48
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,376
Suit yourself.

49
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,214
Those monsters you don't fight?

50
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:01,050
They tend to step on little guys.

51
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,389
<i>It's some sort of nuclear accident.</i>

52
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,351
The sensors are showing an enormous release of heat.

53
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,311
I'll get down there and try to contain it.

54
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,647
That's the odd thing, it's not dissipating.

55
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,274
It's moving in a straight line.

56
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,276
Take Captain Atom.

57
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,463
<i>He might be able to absorb some of the radiation.</i>

58
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,448
Right, and I could use some muscle for crowd control.

59
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,867
Take Supergirl.

60
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,203
She's got to start sometime.

61
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,411
Fine.

62
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:31,580
Use a Javelin.

63
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,207
The radiation's making it impossible

64
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,668
for the transporter to get a fix on the location.

65
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:39,088
- Um, have to... - Captain Atom, Kara.

66
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,381
About time.

67
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,884
Either of you ever been to Chiang Mai?

68
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,195
It's on the state department's

69
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,762
no travel list.

70
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,223
Class Three felony for American citizens to go there.

71
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:50,891
Is it anywhere near Daytona Beach?

72
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,488
You're not gonna leave me up here on Mount Olympus.

73
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,282
You can go back the way you came.

74
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,577
Uh-uh, no one's playing pinball with my molecules again.

75
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,079
Alright, we'll drop you off after we're done.

76
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,020
So, you're gonna let me drive, right?

77
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,688
Whoa, wait a minute.

78
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,773
Has she been certified in a Javelin?

79
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,526
Why don't you take the stick out, corporal?

80
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,903
Captain.

81
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,762
Is that a containment suit?

82
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,139
Uh-huh. I'm not flesh and blood anymore.

83
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,599
Just living energy.

84
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,851
That wouldn't be nuclear energy, would it?

85
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,938
With a name like Captain Atom, what do you think?

86
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,773
I think you're what I marched against

87
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:21,981
back in college.

88
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,083
Looks like we missed the party.

89
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,545
We'll do recon.

90
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,215
If you see anything, don't try to engage.

91
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,675
Roger that.

92
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:50,552
Uh, you can just say okay.

93
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,012
Okay.

94
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:11,073
Hey!

95
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,849
State Department sure was right about them

96
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,337
not liking foreigners.

97
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,339
It's crazy. No reason for it.

98
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,717
- I'll give them a reason. - Kara!

99
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,969
We came here to help them, not to fight.

100
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,363
So, you're just gonna stand there

101
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,722
until they run out of RPGs?

102
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,690
If this radiations thing's as bad as it looks

103
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,088
there's a lot of people out there who are gonna get fried.

104
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,665
My apologies for the fireworks.

105
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,877
Colonel Kim here was just a farmer before the revolution.

106
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:06,920
He doesn't know who you are.

107
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,338
I'm General Kwan.

108
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,215
Most flattered that the Justice League

109
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,176
has honored us with your presence.

110
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,303
But I must ask why.

111
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,263
You had some kind of nuclear accident.

112
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,472
A minor problem.

113
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:18,849
Fully under control.

114
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,350
If it's all the same to you...

115
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,561
It's fully under control.

116
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,354
If it's all the same to you.

117
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,166
Listen, we came a long way to help, and...

118
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,858
Your help is not needed here.

119
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,067
Thank you for coming.

120
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,110
Now, goodbye.

121
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,912
<i>I'm telling you, J'onn.</i>

122
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,456
It took all the restraint I had not to part that guy's hair

123
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:43,664
with my ring.

124
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:44,875
You did the right thing

125
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,835
but the problem is not under control.

126
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,253
It's getting worse.

127
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

128
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,125
They don't want anyone to find out about the accident.

129
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,069
And they don't care how many of their own people

130
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,886
they have to lose to keep it quiet.

131
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,388
This isn't your concern.

132
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,269
He does have a point.

133
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,081
Maybe the three of us should go back and...

134
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,941
No. We can't just do whatever we want.

135
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,859
We have to respect the government's wishes.

136
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,195
No matter what we might think of their policies.

137
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,488
Lantern.

138
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,074
Green Arrow's gone.

139
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,201
And so is the Geiger counter.

140
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,428
Move it! Move it!

141
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,228
Hurry!

142
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,693
Come on!

143
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,126
I told you to stay away.

144
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,437
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

145
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,670
I told you before

146
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,881
the situation is completely under con...

147
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,315
Looks like I just can't help horning in.

148
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:37,816
There's some people up the cliff.

149
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,989
I'll try to drain it.

150
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,594
Go! Go!

151
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,295
There was... too much energy.

152
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,130
Well, there's always the low-tech way.

153
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,588
Lantern!

154
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:49,006
<i>This wouldn't have happened if you'd acted</i>

155
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,270
<i>like you were part of a team.</i>

156
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,950
But I'm not, remember?

157
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,743
So, back off, nuke-boy.

158
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:56,830
Hey! We've got a giant, out-of-control robot out there.

159
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,749
But if you guys are too busy playing alpha male smackdown

160
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,586
I guess I'll just have to deal with it myself.

161
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>Shayera!</i>

162
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,007
You need a plan.

163
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,967
You need to find its weakness.

164
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,802
Those hazmat guys in the village...

165
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,211
they should know something.

166
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,847
Thought you weren't on the team.

167
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,223
Take him.

168
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,184
You'll need all the help you can get.

169
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:20,395
Okay, but I'm gonna be too busy to cover your sorry...

170
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,604
Wouldn't ask you to.

171
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,322
What are we up against?

172
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,491
He asked you a question.

173
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,699
<i>Don't answer them.</i>

174
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,577
That's classified inform... oh!

175
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,537
I've just about had it with you guys.

176
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,915
You've got to the count of five.

177
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,291
One.

178
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,584
Four.

179
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,588
I'd speak up if I were you.

180
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:49,132
<i>It was supposed to be our protector.</i>

181
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,304
It was going to protect us from the foreigners.

182
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,097
But then you lost control of it, right?

183
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,306
Is that what happened?

184
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,392
We have carbon rod dampers.

185
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,187
<i>But we couldn't get close enough to it to put them in.</i>

186
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,772
Where's its reactor?

187
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,482
The front of the upper torso.

188
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,901
But it's too hot. You won't make it.

189
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,109
I'll worry about that.

190
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,614
So, what's the plan?

191
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,325
I shove these carbon rods into the robot's reactor.

192
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,534
That should stop it.

193
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,330
I gotta say, that's not much of a plan.

194
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,958
If you get that close, the heat'll fry you.

195
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,166
I know.

196
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,585
But...

197
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,380
If this doesn't work, contact the League.

198
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,341
They'll know what to do next.

199
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,344
Captain.

200
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,148
Try to distract it.

201
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,441
Roger.

202
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:54,072
Hey! Butane breath!

203
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,407
Say "aah," dirt bag.

204
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:41,674
You sure he's gonna be okay?

205
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,301
He should be.

206
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,470
J'onn's team picked him up right after it happened

207
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,952
so he didn't lose much of his energy.

208
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,143
At least he got a new suit out of it.

209
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:58,149
So. Aren't you gonna give me the "You did good" speech?

210
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,319
You're headstrong, unprofessional, and reckless.

211
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,197
If you ever jeopardize yourself or your teammates again

212
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:07,158
<i>by running off half-cocked without a battle plan</i>

213
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,535
<i>I will personally see to it</i>

214
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,223
that you are kicked out of the League.

215
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,705
I don't care who your cousin is.

216
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:18,795
And incidentally...

217
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,003
you did good.

218
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,262
Huh.

219
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,812
<i>Well, if it isn't the monster killer.</i>

220
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,148
I was lucky. So was everybody else.

221
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,276
Still don't think I belong up here.

222
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:42,694
That's the point.

223
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,196
Someone like you will keep us honest.

224
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,198
Gee, Bats, I don't know.

225
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,327
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good radiation burn

226
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,870
as much as the next guy but I don't think...

227
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,799
So, see you soon?

228
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,717
You just might.
