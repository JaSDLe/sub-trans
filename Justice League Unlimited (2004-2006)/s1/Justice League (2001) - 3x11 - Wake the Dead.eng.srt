1
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>Oh, malefic one</i>

2
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:14,180
<i>your humble servants make you these offerings.</i>

3
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>The bones of wolves ground into powder.</i>

4
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Fat from the flesh of geckos rendered into candles.</i>

5
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:23,523
The rune that is your name

6
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,692
unspeakable by our unworthy tongues.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,654
Oh, malefic one, we beseech thee.

8
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:33,282
Grant us the power to destroy our enemies!

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>Especially Brad Turner</i>

10
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:36,637
who if I have anything to say about it

11
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,538
has given me my last swirly.

12
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:44,085
I'm just saying. It's humiliating.

13
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:45,545
We beseech thee.

14
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,881
Grant us the power to destroy our enemies.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,800
We ask this in your name.

16
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,928
- Whoa. - That was so cool.

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,515
Yeah, but I don't feel any stronger.

18
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,101
Me either. What a rip.

19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,853
Just a lousy light show.

20
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:45,688
That's what I get buying a book of spells

21
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,315
on the Internet.

22
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:50,318
My head's goin' right back in the toilet tomorrow.

23
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:52,153
Don't forget the wedgies.

24
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,030
I don't know if I can take it anymore.

25
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:55,281
Me either.

26
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,950
So I stopped wearing underpants.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,911
<i>Alright, Alan, I guess we'll see you tomorrow.</i>

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,039
And don't forget, these have to be back

29
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:06,208
at the costume shop by 4:00 or we lose our deposit.

30
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,130
Jeez, Stu

31
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,883
did you forget your dice again?

32
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:16,802
Alright, I'm coming!

33
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:27,998
It's your move, Hawkgirl.

34
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,841
Check in five moves.

35
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,968
We'll see.

36
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,176
Diana told me you used to

37
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,179
regularly beat Batman.

38
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,389
Difficult to believe

39
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,797
from the current pitiful level

40
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,183
of your game.

41
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,871
I should have known better than to expect

42
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,983
<i>a proper challenge from a woman.</i>

43
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,614
Such scintillating <i>repartee.</i>

44
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,159
<i>I get better conversation from the android.</i>

45
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,287
You are aware I'm in the room.

46
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,707
Check.

47
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,087
I win again.

48
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,547
Huzzah.

49
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,007
It's just a game.

50
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,471
You disgust me.

51
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,849
Join the club.

52
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,853
I could've told you that wouldn't work.

53
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,689
She was once one of the fiercest warriors I'd ever met.

54
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,151
- What's she doing here? - Trying to find her way.

55
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,820
Leaving the Justice League was difficult for her.

56
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,281
I provided her sanctuary, a place to meditate

57
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,158
on her life and future.

58
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,744
We must allow her the time she needs to...

59
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,121
Excuse me.

60
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:59,131
New game?

61
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,846
John, this is Dr. Fate.

62
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,975
<i>We may have a problem.</i>

63
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,895
chirp chirp chirp

64
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,033
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.

65
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,244
The garden needed work.

66
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,329
Don't go, Inza. This is your place.

67
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,248
I'm just a visitor here.

68
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:35,251
My husband and I have offered you our hospitality.

69
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,419
We respect your privacy.

70
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,880
Treat this area as you would your own home.

71
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:44,844
Aquaman thinks I've been here too long.

72
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,471
Flowers bloom when they're ready, Shayera.

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,140
- Not before. - I'm no flower.

74
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,892
I don't know what I am.

75
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,352
I'm not Lieutenant Shayera Hol

76
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,979
of the Thanagarian Empire.

77
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,187
Not anymore.

78
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,648
I've been stripped of my rank

79
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,900
exiled from my home world.

80
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,903
I'm not Hawkgirl. That was always a sham.

81
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,912
Most people on Earth will never trust me again

82
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,574
and I can't blame them.

83
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,659
When I do my job, people get hurt.

84
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,619
People I care about.

85
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,872
And what happens when you don't do your job?

86
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,324
Green Lantern. Go ahead.

87
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,035
You're on in five, love.

88
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,495
Randy, get a move on.

89
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,164
Copy that, she's on her way.

90
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,176
You're early.

91
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,470
I'd say I timed things perfectly.

92
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,180
<i>I meant for our dinner date.</i>

93
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,557
<i>The fashion show's not over for another half an hour.</i>

94
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,894
It's over for us. We've got Justice League business.

95
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,354
<i>I figured.</i>

96
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,066
Aren't you dressed yet?

97
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,526
It doesn't take me as long as you.

98
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,570
Come on, Vixen.

99
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,030
I'll fill you in on the way.

100
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,221
Dr. Fate called it. Solomon Grundy's back.

101
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,515
The zombie guy? A heavy hitter.

102
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:56,058
I read about him in the files.

103
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,894
Yeah, he's tough, but we can handle him.

104
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,896
Funny thing is, he's supposed to be dead.

105
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,899
Aren't all zombies, by definition, dead?

106
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,412
Oh, man, don't do it.

107
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,777
John!

108
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,992
Come with it then!

109
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,083
Get the Lantern somewhere safe.

110
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,292
I could've handled him.

111
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,129
You may get your chance.

112
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,672
In the meantime, humor me.

113
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,553
Come on, Grundy! We've been through this before.

114
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,114
You don't have a chance against me.

115
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,099
Let's talk it over. Maybe I can help.

116
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,460
Checkmate. You are improving.

117
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,630
This time it took me 16 moves to defeat you.

118
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,841
<i>That's nearly double the number it took last time.</i>

119
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,844
Uh. Set up the board.

120
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,516
Solomon Grundy's grave is empty.

121
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,643
Tell me where to find those responsible

122
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,270
then dig more graves.

123
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,397
We are dealing with something far more sinister

124
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,107
than mere human avarice.

125
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,318
Grundy's grave was forced open from the inside.

126
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,529
The site reeks of chaos magic.

127
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,614
He left under his own power?

128
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,034
Far more power than he ever evidenced before. Behold.

129
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:16,091
- They need our help. - So does Grundy.

130
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,340
Let's try and get there before the league kills him.

131
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,099
<i>That scenario seems unlikely.</i>

132
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,478
In any case, are you certain you're up to this?

133
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,687
Doesn't matter.

134
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,190
Bad guy or not, he sacrificed

135
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,608
his life to save ours.

136
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,985
We owe him the benefit of the doubt.

137
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,278
Very well.

138
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,617
<i>I've learned the hard way that the energy dampening properties</i>

139
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,453
<i>of this device can disrupt fundamental forces.</i>

140
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:47,206
<i>So I've kept it hidden in a pocket dimension</i>

141
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:50,626
<i>away from the magic that must flow freely in my home.</i>

142
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,754
<i>But if you are truly ready to take up the fight again...</i>

143
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,766
I'm ready.

144
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,327
Hang on. I'm coming for you.

145
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,582
Come on. I'll get you down.

146
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:09,848
Shayera?

147
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,102
Hate the beard.

148
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,191
You okay?

149
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,152
Do I look okay?

150
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,945
Better than Grundy's about to.

151
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,394
<i>Perhaps we can be of assistance.</i>

152
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,999
Okay, let's throw a wave of our big guns at him.

153
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,919
Me, Fate, and the android.

154
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,379
We let him out of the tower now?

155
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,923
I'm curious to see how you would dissuade him.

156
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,131
Hold up.

157
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,414
Before golden boy teleports him

158
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,968
into the sun, I want to try

159
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,845
talking to him.

160
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,263
Shayera, wait!

161
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:56,103
Grundy!

162
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,147
It's me.

163
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,903
Remember? Bird-Nose?

164
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,330
Back!

165
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:34,558
- What's happened to him? - I'm sorry.

166
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:38,103
I sense nothing of the Grundy we know within that shell.

167
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,105
He is nothing but rage.

168
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:42,691
Then it is time I brought this to an end.

169
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,194
No! Don't hurt him!

170
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,955
In my travels through space

171
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,540
I've attained mastery of forces

172
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,876
all but incomprehensible to humans.

173
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,084
I...

174
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,252
Wait.

175
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,509
Something's wrong.

176
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,137
The creature is somehow feeding on my energies.

177
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,181
<i>He adds my power to his own.</i>

178
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,728
My presence here puts you all at risk.

179
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:21,539
I will retreat several light-years' distance

180
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,483
until I can determine how to counter this effect.

181
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:35,952
Tell us something, doc.

182
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,288
Grundy was revived with chaos magic

183
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,333
accumulative and with no known upper limit.

184
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,628
My magics are as useless as Amazo's technology.

185
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,839
Then I say we take him out the old-fashioned way.

186
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,325
- No way it's this easy. - Sure it is.

187
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,827
The android half fried him with the cosmic thing.

188
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,316
All we had to do was seal the...

189
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,507
Put her down!

190
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,350
You heard the man.

191
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,865
Don't make me do this, Grundy.

192
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,403
- I don't see him. - Neither do I.

193
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,072
There must be lead in those old sewer pipes.

194
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,450
Guy tends to leave a trail. We'll find him.

195
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,369
And then pretty Polly can bash him with her magic mace.

196
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,331
- Why does it hurt him? - <i> It's made of Nth metal.</i>

197
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,666
Your people's technology was developed specifically

198
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,543
to repel magical creatures.

199
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,421
It disrupts the magic that animates him.

200
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,799
The creature knows only rage and seeks only oblivion.

201
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,052
Your mace may be the one object on Earth

202
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,762
that can grant him peace.

203
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,640
What are you saying?

204
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,117
Your favorite movie's "Old Yeller."

205
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,477
You know exactly what he's saying.

206
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,187
Is this my destiny?

207
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:08,480
To be a destroyer?

208
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,482
To betray yet another friend?

209
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,025
It's not that simple.

210
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,902
It never was.

211
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,322
Hey, how 'bout we discuss it for another couple of hours?

212
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,074
That way, he's sure to escape.

213
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:21,002
Only you have the power to put that creature

214
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,285
out of its misery.

215
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,494
And to stop it before it

216
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,038
hurts anyone else.

217
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,376
<i>You don't have to, Shayera.</i>

218
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,879
I'll do it for you.

219
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,214
Give me the mace.

220
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,052
Forget it, John. He was my friend.

221
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,137
It's my responsibility.

222
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,847
I'll do it myself.

223
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,643
Shh, it's okay.

224
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,770
I know what you want.

225
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,439
What you need.

226
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,235
Close your eyes.

227
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,549
That's long enough. I'm going in after her.

228
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:13,228
It's over.

229
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,452
Hawkgirl, do you think today's act

230
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,370
can possibly make up for your complicity

231
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,080
<i>in the Thanagarian invasion of Earth?</i>

232
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,832
Do you have a comment on your dismissal

233
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>from the Justice League?</i>

234
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,461
Hawkgirl was <i>never</i> dismissed from the league.

235
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:38,963
She can come back whenever she likes.

236
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,301
I recused myself because...

237
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,638
Well, anyway, Superman broke the tie.

238
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,475
I believe in second chances.

239
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,143
I believe in redemption.

240
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,895
But mostly...

241
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:55,563
I believe in my friends.

242
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,067
- <i>Traitor!</i> - Go back where you came from!

243
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:06,199
Back off! She doesn't have to take that from you people!

244
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,785
Yes, I do, but it's okay.

245
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,829
I guess I deserve some of it.

246
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,629
You saved our lives.

247
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,382
God bless you, <i>Chica Halcon.</i>

248
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,925
<i>You deserve that too.</i>
