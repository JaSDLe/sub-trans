1
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,186
You said "Come back Tuesday."

2
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,479
<i>It's Tuesday.</i>

3
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,523
I want my suit.

4
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,274
Patience, brother.

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,361
You know how much I care about the details.

6
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:30,655
It doesn't have to be pretty, Hephaestus.

7
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:34,033
Where it's going things aren't supposed to be pretty.

8
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,453
Present company excluded, of course.

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,913
Just hurry up!

10
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:49,757
My finishing touch.

11
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,361
<i>The Annihilator.</i>

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,321
<i>Heartless, indestructible</i>

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,531
and ready to feed

14
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,701
on mankind's misery and rage

15
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,328
per your specifications.

16
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,122
Go ahead, Ares.

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,665
Give it life.

18
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,060
Enough!

19
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,193
Wrap it up.

20
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,653
I'll take it.

21
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,704
Impressive.

22
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:25,996
Isn't it?

23
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,251
I knew about advances

24
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,003
in unmanned weaponry, but this is incredible.

25
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,296
Who built it?

26
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,006
Ever heard the expression

27
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,134
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth"?

28
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,846
Ah, classified.

29
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,223
Now, I've already taken the liberty of imprinting it

30
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,559
to your voice commands.

31
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:47,768
So, Mr. Nardoc

32
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,770
the only question is

33
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,897
are you interested?

34
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,233
Of course, anything to protect us

35
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,193
from those dogs in the south.

36
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,486
But Mr. Sera

37
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,156
you know how little money we have.

38
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,200
We can worry about that later.

39
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,452
You're joking, right?

40
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,413
No, I trust you.

41
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,540
It's not like you're going anywhere, is it?

42
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,001
With this weapon's help

43
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,712
<i>no, we are certainly staying right here.</i>

44
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,046
Follow.

45
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,477
Come on, go, go, go!

46
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,789
I try to take a day off

47
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,874
try to have a semblance of a normal life

48
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,794
but you had to pick today to rob a bank.

49
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,303
Oh, yeah.

50
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,846
Like that's going to work.

51
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,348
Wait! Please.

52
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,556
I've learned my lesson.

53
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,934
I promise.

54
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,185
No, you haven't.

55
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:19,944
Your kind never learns.

56
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,321
And it's really starting to get on my nerves.

57
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,530
<i>Diana.</i>

58
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:24,572
In a minute.

59
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,908
<i>Diana!</i>

60
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,116
I'm not finished here.

61
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,243
<i>I'd say you are.</i>

62
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,038
Fine.

63
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,046
<i>Queen Adria of Kaznia has asked the League for help.</i>

64
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,714
<i>Her nation is being torn apart</i>

65
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,591
by warring paramilitary groups.

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,010
Each faction has ties with neighboring countries.

67
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,303
If this escalates

68
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,472
it could easily ignite the region.

69
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,057
What's wrong with people, J'onn?

70
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,184
Hostility's their answer to everything.

71
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,270
You're not one to talk of late.

72
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,638
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,981
<i>Diana...</i>

74
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,858
you and I have both been affected

75
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>by our time among humans.</i>

76
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,404
It's important that we keep ourselves in check.

77
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,614
First of all, those thugs back there

78
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,700
got exactly what they had coming.

79
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:10,286
As did that band of mercenaries last week.

80
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:12,538
And those creatures from the Decorin Nebula.

81
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,206
They weren't misunderstood.

82
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,041
They thought we were food!

83
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,877
You're right, Diana.

84
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,087
<i>None of it has anything to do with you.</i>

85
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:22,423
<i>Before heading to Kaznia</i>

86
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>you're going to have to make a stop.</i>

87
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:29,930
Fine mess here, Don.

88
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,850
Talk to them. You speak Neanderthal?

89
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,977
I think they're done talking.

90
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,270
This is ridiculous.

91
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:37,771
Just because I disagree with you

92
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,815
doesn't make me unpatriotic.

93
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,984
No, you being a bleeding-heart punk

94
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,861
makes you unpatriotic.

95
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,196
Actually, I've got to agree with him on that one.

96
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,865
<i>Too late trying to side with us.</i>

97
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,233
You're both taking a beating.

98
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,995
Look, we got off on the wrong foot.

99
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,483
But don't you think we could find

100
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,057
plenty of things we all have in common

101
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,416
if we just tried?

102
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,086
- Nope. - Hank, say something.

103
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:06,799
Preemptive strike.

104
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,763
Hawk.

105
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:12,847
Dove.

106
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:28,864
Boo.

107
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,128
Oh, you so wanted to do this.

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,298
Don't blame me.

109
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,550
You're the one who couldn't keep your trap shut.

110
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,025
Now, how about you calm down

111
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,318
and I'll let you go.

112
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,946
How about you kiss my a...

113
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,462
You didn't answer your summons.

114
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,964
Look around, princess.

115
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>Had our hands full.</i>

116
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,192
Enough to go around if you want a piece.

117
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,719
Out.

118
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:33,886
Now.

119
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,782
The northern tribes have infested

120
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,326
our motherland for too many generations.

121
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,037
Kaznia is ours.

122
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,747
By the blood of our fathers

123
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,707
and our fathers' fathers.

124
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:08,172
Right now, they're preparing a new weapon

125
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,758
a weapon with fearsome power.

126
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,052
We've got to attack now.

127
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,929
To protect your farms and your families

128
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,723
from their vicious hands.

129
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,936
Move out.

130
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,898
And may fortune be with you!

131
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,087
Why not just let them obliterate each other?

132
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,089
If people can't control their own country

133
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,715
they don't deserve to have one.

134
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,467
<i>Way to oversimplify.</i>

135
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:54,795
These folks live in poverty.

136
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,386
And when you have so little

137
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,806
it's easy to be swayed into blaming your neighbor.

138
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,475
Almost all aggression can be cured with education.

139
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,683
Yeah?

140
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,787
Then how come some of the best

141
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,853
educated guys in the world

142
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,062
work at the Pentagon?

143
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,105
Down there.

144
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,959
W-Whoa.

145
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,430
Who is that?

146
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,399
<i>These people don't stand a chance against it.</i>

147
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,311
Hawk, you're with me. Dove...

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm on it.

149
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,447
Both of you. Scram.

150
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,014
Huh-uh.

151
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,280
There's no one inside that thing.

152
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:39,781
How do you fight that?

153
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,575
You hit it till it breaks.

154
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,478
Whoa.

155
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,941
Hey.

156
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:20,239
What are you doing?

157
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:21,990
You pulled us right out of battle.

158
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,117
She just saved our lives, Hank.

159
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,661
Two yards would have done that.

160
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,371
This is what's called a retreat.

161
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,164
There was no point continuing.

162
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,124
We were having no effect on that thing.

163
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,834
If anything, it was getting stronger.

164
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,088
There's got to be a way to stop this war.

165
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:37,798
If we could just get the two leaders

166
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,174
to sit down together.

167
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,568
Oh, 'cause that happens all the time

168
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,135
in these situations.

169
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,424
Unless, you want to just kidnap <i>em and make 'em talk.</i>

170
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,390
- I wish. - Then go for it.

171
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,016
At least it'll buy me some time.

172
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,269
Why? What are you doing?

173
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,271
I've got to see a man about a suit of armor.

174
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,315
You let them go.

175
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,566
Why didn't you push ahead

176
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,068
and take their camp?

177
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,837
They have enough arsenal there to launch

178
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,989
an assault against the capital.

179
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,491
I have no designs on the capital.

180
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,326
We won, Mr. Sera.

181
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,577
The animals attacked

182
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,288
and we ran them out of town.

183
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,914
I didn't give you the Annihilator

184
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,125
so you could run your enemies out of town.

185
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,960
I gave you the Annihilator

186
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:17,838
so you could annihilate them!

187
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,589
Forgive the insult, sir.

188
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,717
But you think like a South Kaznian.

189
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,343
<i>They want to destroy us all</i>

190
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,053
<i>but my brothers and I only wish</i>

191
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,513
<i>to keep our land.</i>

192
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,557
Perhaps I could take their camp

193
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,309
but the price would be too great.

194
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:33,145
Shall I win a country but massacre my people?

195
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:34,771
Yes, you idiot!

196
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,815
I think like a South Kaznian?

197
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,317
Has it even entered your skull

198
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:41,194
that they think like South Kaznians?

199
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,655
And you better start thinking that way too

200
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,464
if you want there to be a northerner left

201
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,951
in this rat-infested dirt heap you call a country.

202
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,412
All any of you mortals are good for

203
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,414
is to slaughter one another.

204
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:55,042
To fight and fight, until the bones of your enemies

205
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,169
are strewn across the battlefield!

206
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:58,962
Only to rise again

207
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,255
<i>in the next generation</i>

208
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,257
<i>like a well-tended crop.</i>

209
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,386
That's what the Annihilator is for.

210
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,804
But no-o-o.

211
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,432
You're using it to play tag.

212
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,852
You know what?

213
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,896
You're crazy and I wash my hands of you.

214
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,124
I'll thank you to get out of

215
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,442
my rat-infested dirt heap now.

216
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,090
And you can take your robot with you.

217
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:26,073
Better idea.

218
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,282
I stay.

219
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,491
You go.

220
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,418
I made that armor for your mother.

221
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,545
Did she ever thank me?

222
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,880
No.

223
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,089
I love your mom

224
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,549
but she didn't have your build.

225
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,512
I didn't come here to talk about my armor.

226
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,514
There's an armored suit fighting in Kaznia

227
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,891
that needs no wearer and bears your mark.

228
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,601
The Annihilator.

229
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,269
Then you did make it.

230
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,398
Who else does such fine work?

231
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,024
Ares liked it.

232
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,233
Ares.

233
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:03,275
Of course.

234
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,946
How do you stop it?

235
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:07,239
Aww.

236
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,491
You knew to ask.

237
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,493
I do leave a small weakness

238
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,745
in each of my creations.

239
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,498
An Achilles' heel, if you will.

240
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:20,001
It's so no one ever gets too powerful.

241
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,628
You know what they say

242
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,047
only Zeus is perfect.

243
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,758
And what's the Annihilator's weakness?

244
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,677
Diana, you wouldn't want me

245
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,345
to go around telling people

246
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,847
the weakness in your armor

247
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,514
would you?

248
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:38,937
With that attitude

249
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,522
you'll never figure it out.

250
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,529
Come back when you have more time.

251
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,241
I'll let that suit out a little.

252
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,416
Sorry, kid. You'll have a headache later.

253
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,376
But on the bright side, if this works

254
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,585
you'll live to see 20.

255
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,761
Don't be afraid.

256
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,096
My name is Dove.

257
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,305
I'm not here to hurt you.

258
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,224
I'd like you to come with me.

259
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,809
It's time to try a new path.

260
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,728
And what path is that?

261
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:21,021
Peace.

262
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:24,065
Hmm, not really my thing.

263
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,945
But if you're into it

264
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,322
I can arrange for you

265
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,241
to have eternal peace.

266
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,453
After I'm done with you that is.

267
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,552
Ever run away from home?

268
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,179
It's fun. You'll love it.

269
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:56,181
Brother and me used to do it all the time.

270
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,469
Except he'd always wuss out

271
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,516
and run home to mama.

272
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,232
General. The northern forces are...

273
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,544
I see Don's social skills

274
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:27,003
had their usual effect.

275
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,131
Huh-ah.

276
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,724
Lay down your arms.

277
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:21,975
You're being used.

278
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,026
What in...

279
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,323
Have a nice day.

280
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,455
Don't let them take the camp.

281
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,998
Our arsenal...

282
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,841
You must stop this.

283
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,802
I must do nothing.

284
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,513
I don't take orders from women.

285
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,070
The Annihilator.

286
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:58,822
It's fueled by our rage.

287
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,832
Lower your weapons!

288
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,378
You don't have a chance like that

289
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,672
so try it my way!

290
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,716
Lower your weapons!

291
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:23,595
Don!

292
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,433
Let go of me.

293
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:27,641
He's weak.

294
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,394
He'll get himself killed.

295
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,020
Don!

296
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,978
Anybody want to give me a clue what just happened?

297
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,646
Sometimes it takes more strength

298
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,855
not to fight.

299
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,109
What's the matter with you people?

300
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,444
Keep fighting!

301
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,321
This is your chance to finish them.

302
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:26,910
Give it up, Ares.

303
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,118
It's over.

304
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,161
You lose.

305
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,998
Alright.

306
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,333
This time.

307
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,168
But I'll be back

308
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,253
and sooner than you think.

309
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,922
Wherever there's prejudice

310
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,049
ignorance, inequality

311
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:42,257
I'll be there.

312
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,261
And I'll be waiting.

313
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,849
You see?

314
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:51,976
Doesn't this prove exactly

315
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,561
what I've been saying for years?

316
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,938
Couldn't tell you.

317
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,774
- I do my best not to listen. - What?

318
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:00,401
<i>And another thing, don't go all Gandhi on me.</i>

319
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,130
<i>You think you can pull this every time.</i>
