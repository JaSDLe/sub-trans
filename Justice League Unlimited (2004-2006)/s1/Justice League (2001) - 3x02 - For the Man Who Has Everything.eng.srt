1
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:41,207
A little sharp on the turn, don't you think?

2
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,417
Sorry if I scared you.

3
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,109
What did you get him?

4
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,695
I'm not saying anything.

5
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,239
He'll hear and spoil the surprise.

6
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:15,950
He can hear that, too.

7
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:17,952
How about you?

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,720
He's not the easiest person in the world

9
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,539
to buy birthday presents for.

10
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,501
Bruce, you didn't get him a gift certificate?

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,545
No.

12
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,838
Cash.

13
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,843
I mean, what do you buy for the man who has everything...

14
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,384
Looks like some kind of plant.

15
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,028
Seems to be to be growing through his costume

16
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,680
and into his body.

17
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,431
Is he breathing?

18
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,100
Barely.

19
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:05,868
Someone must have breached the fortress.

20
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,688
Agreed. Have a look around.

21
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:14,151
Pupils aren't contracting even slightly.

22
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,071
He must be cut off from all sensation.

23
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,615
Kent, where are you?

24
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,873
<i>This is your wake-up alarm.</i>

25
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,341
Good morning, Kal-El, and happy birthday.

26
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,052
Thanks, Brainiac.

27
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,345
Windows, please.

28
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:02,783
Please don't tell me it's morning already.

29
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,704
That's what you get for partying all night.

30
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,289
I was working.

31
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,583
Come on, honey. You call that work?

32
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,211
Covering the opening of the Argo City Museum of Modern Art?

33
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,090
Hobnobbing with all the movers and shakers?

34
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,093
Mmm, a bunch of bores.

35
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,970
You could have come, you know.

36
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,179
Next time.

37
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,681
Oh, please.

38
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,141
I couldn't get you off this farm

39
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,101
if I exploded a quantum bomb under your...

40
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,610
Did you... unh!

41
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:40,154
Come here, handsome.

42
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>A gentle reminder.</i>

43
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,868
Kal-El and Van-El are expected

44
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,204
at Jor-El's laboratory in precisely 2 hours

45
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:51,791
and 12 minutes, and the Vac-40 is overdue for inspection.

46
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,001
Shut up!

47
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:02,468
<i>So it was a gift.</i>

48
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,512
Teleported here from some alien culture

49
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,722
some grateful world.

50
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,141
Or someone wanting you to think they were grateful.

51
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,728
<i>How remarkable.</i>

52
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,565
<i>You animals really are almost intelligent, aren't you?</i>

53
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,109
That's exactly what happened.

54
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,281
Mongul.

55
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,159
You recognize me. I'm flattered.

56
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,747
I suppose Superman told you all about our previous encounter.

57
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,166
You mean how he humiliated you?

58
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,378
A... jaundiced account.

59
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,925
What inferior specimens he surrounds himself with.

60
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,595
I took her down before she even knew I was there

61
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,723
and I'll take this planet just as easily.

62
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,355
Maybe not as easily as you think.

63
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:02,027
We inferior specimens call it "playing possum".

64
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,490
- No. - No?

65
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,536
Clearly the males on this world are the smart ones.

66
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:15,040
He wants to know about the plant.

67
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,668
The Black Mercy is a telepathic species.

68
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,754
It reads the heart's desire and feeds the individual

69
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,257
a totally convincing simulation of it.

70
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,926
So he's dreaming?

71
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,470
Oh, far deeper than any dream.

72
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,266
I wonder where he thinks he is.

73
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,894
Sitting on a throne ruling the universe

74
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,897
all you human garbage fawning at his feet?

75
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,607
More honest, don't you think

76
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:42,818
than this pretense of being a selfless hero?

77
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,202
You don't understand.

78
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,414
He was the only obstacle in my way.

79
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,584
The rest of you are already dead.

80
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,510
Van! Van, your breakfast is getting cold.

81
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,803
<i>I'm coming.</i>

82
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,142
Looks like the dog left you a present.

83
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,144
Brainiac?

84
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,104
Could you clean up that...

85
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,734
No, Brainiac.

86
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,362
Van was supposed to walk the dog.

87
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,823
It's his job to clean it up.

88
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,784
Van-El, I want you down here right...

89
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:34,203
<i>I'm here, I'm here!</i>

90
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,208
It's okay, Krypto.

91
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,752
How many times do I have to tell you, Van?

92
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,587
When you asked for a dog, you...

93
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,675
Promised to take care of it. I know. Sorry, dad.

94
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,931
Sorry's not always enough. We have to...

95
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,766
Live up to our responsibilities.

96
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,726
I know, I know!

97
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,608
This mean I can't come to the party?

98
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,943
Oops.

99
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,362
What party is that?

100
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,407
Uh, the, uh...

101
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,033
You're confused, Van.

102
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,160
Little Zod's party isn't till next...

103
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,497
I told you I didn't want a surprise party.

104
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,416
And you're not getting one.

105
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:21,709
Eat your breakfast, Van.

106
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:22,936
You and dad don't want to be late

107
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,420
visiting grandpa Jor-El.

108
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,505
Indeed. Traffic on the Kandor skyway

109
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,007
is backed up to the gold volcano.

110
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,426
Kandor. I forgot!

111
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,888
I don't want a surprise party.

112
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,433
It's just a small one.

113
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,951
Huh!

114
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:16,305
<i>How nice of you to volunteer...</i>

115
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,934
to be the first of your race to die.

116
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,258
He'll kill her, Clark.

117
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,718
And then he'll kill us all.

118
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,929
Shake it off. Come back to us.

119
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,556
<i>Please.</i>

120
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:20,702
Oh, dear. Is that a Neural Impactor?

121
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,664
I didn't know they were still making those.

122
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:29,086
I'd advise you to try the plasma disruptor.

123
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,797
It's more of a woman's weapon.

124
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,882
Go, to...

125
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,188
Nothing's working!

126
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,359
She's in the hall of weapons.

127
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,154
That will buy her time, but not enough.

128
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,447
She's fighting for her life, Clark.

129
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,158
You've got to fight, too.

130
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,544
I can't believe you left all this

131
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,754
to live on a farm.

132
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,548
It's a nice place to visit, but...

133
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,384
Van, did you...

134
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,677
Grandpa!

135
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,099
Brainiac?

136
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,351
A minor and completely harmless tremor.

137
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,188
Predicted several weeks ago by the Seismic Institute.

138
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:50,459
First, I'll kill you and the Bat

139
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,961
and then I'll take this planet.

140
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,172
You won't win.

141
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,716
Of course I will.

142
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:12,189
What's this one, grandpa?

143
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,608
And this?

144
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,610
Whoa! Where'd you get...

145
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:18,528
One minute, Van.

146
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,030
Something's bothering you.

147
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,826
Here...

148
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,371
and here and here.

149
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,499
A series of mild tremors. Not unusual.

150
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:33,001
- I don't see what... - Something's wrong, dad.

151
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,379
Something's going to happen. I can feel it in...

152
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,172
Oh. So you're a scientist now?

153
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,381
Dad.

154
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,609
Do I have to remind you about

155
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,009
a certain prediction of my own?

156
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,761
Made, I'm embarrassed to say

157
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,763
when you were only a few days old?

158
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,132
I announced to the world that

159
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,933
Krypton was going to explode

160
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,894
and it took me years to salvage my reputation.

161
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,438
But maybe you were right, maybe...

162
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,736
Maybe I've just been working too hard.

163
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,864
The past is dead.

164
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,200
Focus on the future.

165
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,035
Can we go up to the roof, grandpa?

166
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,329
Somebody wants to see the macroscope.

167
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,290
Go on up with your father, Van.

168
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,875
I'll be along in a few minutes.

169
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,793
Let's go.

170
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,390
It's not right.

171
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,190
Yes. That's it.

172
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,026
Fight it, Clark.

173
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,234
Fight it.

174
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,615
<i>Fight it.</i>

175
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,824
Dad?

176
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,494
<i>Dad?</i>

177
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,872
You've got to look at thi...

178
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,168
What's... what's the matter?

179
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,962
Why are you...

180
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,631
Van, when you were born

181
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,718
it was the happiest day of my life.

182
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:07,846
When I first saw your beautiful little face

183
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,058
your tiny fingers squeezed my hand so tight.

184
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,686
Like you never wanted to let go.

185
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,023
I've watched every step, every struggle.

186
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:20,734
I've... but Van...

187
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,778
Rao, help me.

188
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,364
But I don't think you're real.

189
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,116
I don't think any of this is-is real.

190
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,659
Don't say that, daddy.

191
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,912
Please. You're scaring me.

192
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,374
No, no. I don't want to scare you, Van.

193
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,668
You are everything I ever wanted in a son.

194
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,170
This...

195
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,340
This is everything I ever wanted in a life.

196
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,969
But I've got responsibilities, Van.

197
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,055
And... I...

198
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,473
have to go now.

199
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,037
Daddy.

200
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,750
I promise you.

201
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,294
I'll never forget.

202
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,636
Yes!

203
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:37,185
<i>Beware my terrible sword.</i>

204
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,276
Ha ha!

205
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,820
Let all evildoers beware my...

206
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,581
We'll start with the pretty pearls

207
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,416
around the lady's neck.

208
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,336
Now.

209
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,056
Yes!

210
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,692
Do you have any idea what you did to me?

211
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,920
I fashioned a prison that you couldn't leave

212
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,464
without sacrificing your heart's desire.

213
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:34,970
It must have been like tearing off your own arm.

214
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,171
Bruce.

215
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,269
Happy birthday, Kryptonian.

216
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,896
I give you oblivion.

217
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,982
Burn.

218
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,131
Hera, no!

219
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,726
Bruce!

220
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,979
Get him, dad, get him!

221
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,984
<i>Bruce!</i>

222
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,384
You should have stayed in whatever happy fantasy

223
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,178
the Black Mercy granted you.

224
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,818
Happy?

225
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,576
Do you know what I've lost?

226
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,207
What I've...

227
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,011
You know, for a moment there

228
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,305
<i>I almost believed you were gonna kill me.</i>

229
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,892
How stupid of you to hesitate like that.

230
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,688
Not a mistake I'll make, I can assure you.

231
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:34,232
<i>Excuse me...</i>

232
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,653
but I think this is yours.

233
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,667
This... this was your birthday present.

234
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,335
A new breed of rose.

235
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,880
Called the Krypton, but...

236
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,467
Don't worry about it.

237
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,350
I promise you.

238
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,895
I'll never forget.

239
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,606
I wonder what he's seeing.

240
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:21,404
Whatever it is, it's too good for him.
