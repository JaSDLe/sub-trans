1
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,839
<i>Previously on "Justice League Unlimited."</i>

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,466
You invent a time machine

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,968
and can't think of anything useful to do with it?

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,763
I can use it to get away from you.

5
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:16,307
David Clinton, inventor of the chrono suit

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,975
at your disposal.

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,936
You tried to steal Batman's utility belt.

8
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:24,232
Don't hurt anyone. We could accidentally change history.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,319
We've been expecting you.

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,698
Static? What's going on?

11
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,907
Dad?

12
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,806
We need to get out of here.

13
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,312
Leaving so soon?

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,522
You didn't even take any party favors.

15
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:49,567
Incoming!

16
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,282
That's not gonna hold.

17
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,416
Where do you think you're going, sugar?

18
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,807
Look, Dee Dee, another Green Lantern.

19
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,269
He's much cuter than the last one we killed.

20
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,646
Don't you think, Dee Dee?

21
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,198
How'd you...

22
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,309
Hold still so I can pound you.

23
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,769
Yeah, that's what I'll do.

24
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:53,107
Hey, what's the big idea?

25
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,903
You shouldn't oughta have done that.

26
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,123
We're getting out of here now.

27
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,375
Not a chance. Hold the line.

28
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,024
He's right. We're the Justice League.

29
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,336
We don't run from a fight.

30
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,768
I don't remember putting this up for a vote.

31
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,382
<i>Keep your head in the game, kid.</i>

32
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:30,853
There's always another way.

33
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,938
Virgil, I need some cover.

34
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,946
They're gone, Dee Dee.

35
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,715
Bet I know which way they went, Dee Dee.

36
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,537
After 'em!

37
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,503
I think we've lost them.

38
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:57,630
Where are we headed? The Watchtower?

39
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:58,838
Not exactly.

40
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,526
This is Justice League headquarters?

41
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,403
For now.

42
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,531
We're all that's left of the league.

43
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:26,075
You've traveled about 50 years into your future.

44
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,663
Last time I saw you, you were too young to drive.

45
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,289
You look good for a man your age.

46
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,333
The miracles of modern medicine.

47
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,751
Sixty five is the new thirty.

48
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,003
- And the Watchtower? - It's gone.

49
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,464
We lost a lot of good people that day.

50
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,259
You mean, Superman, J'onn, all the others?

51
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,803
Yeah. You too.

52
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,057
And the bat-cave?

53
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,268
<i>This is all we have left now.</i>

54
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,895
Deal with it.

55
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,363
- Surprised to see me? - A little.

56
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,365
I'm more surprised that I lived so long.

57
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,534
Batman, Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne, Batman.

58
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:09,742
Or have you met?

59
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:10,953
- Not now. - Not now.

60
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,601
Great. What did they used to call it?

61
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,831
Stereo?

62
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,499
This is a little weird for everybody.

63
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm Warhawk, Rex Stewart.

64
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,879
Your mother. Who is she?

65
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,922
Kind of obvious, don't you think?

66
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,133
Even if it isn't, leave it be.

67
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,221
You don't wanna know too much about your future.

68
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,095
Trust me, you really don't.

69
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,472
Shayera was one cranky pregnant lady.

70
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,017
Although, to be fair, if I'd laid an egg that size.

71
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,768
He's kidding, dad.

72
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,329
Not that I understand why you think

73
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,855
<i>this is anything to joke about.</i>

74
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,441
Because we already won. Think about it.

75
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,109
If old Bruce is here

76
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,879
that means he already lived through this as Batman.

77
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,279
Flawless logic.

78
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,157
Except that I have no memory of ever going to the future

79
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,491
and meeting my older self

80
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,744
or of anything else that's happening today.

81
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,079
Those historical buildings we saw on the street.

82
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,706
The timeline's been polluted.

83
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,710
So polluted that history itself is becoming fluid.

84
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,420
We'd better compare notes.

85
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,927
Enid, I have to say that I'm vexed.

86
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:11,180
Yes, vexed is precisely the word for it.

87
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,682
You shouldn't let yourself get upset, David.

88
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,060
You're right, dear.

89
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:18,312
But here we are.

90
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,522
Now, look at it from my point of view.

91
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,275
I go to the trouble of taking over the whole city

92
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,945
so I have a nice place to keep my collection.

93
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,281
And it's a beautiful collection, David.

94
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,367
I was gonna say the same thing, boss.

95
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:34,828
For instance, this is a really nice boat. Big!

96
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,456
Don't patronize me, Chucko

97
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,000
and especially, don't interrupt me.

98
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,961
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,713
Sorry what?

100
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,090
Everybody?

101
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,467
Sorry, Lord Chronos!

102
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,345
It doesn't seem right. I go to the future.

103
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,682
I get the technology that gives you all your new super powers.

104
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,767
I let you run amuck in my town

105
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,937
in return for the occasional <i>security</i> job

106
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,481
and what do you do in return?

107
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,024
<i>Um...</i>

108
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,818
Rhetorical.

109
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,320
My point is, I give you an easy job.

110
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,448
Take care of Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern.

111
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,534
It should have been ten minutes work.

112
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,827
But the JLU showed up.

113
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,412
They got in our way.

114
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,205
Yes, they did.

115
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,207
And the question arises

116
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,709
who told them where

117
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,585
and when our targets would arrive?

118
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,587
I mean, I told you

119
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,799
and I only know because I'm the undisputed master

120
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,884
of space and time.

121
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,553
I'll look into it, boss.

122
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,388
I'll find out where the leak was.

123
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,974
No, don't trouble yourself, Chucko.

124
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,934
No, don't bother.

125
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,769
I already know.

126
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:53,532
Somebody's getting a payoff.

127
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,284
Yes, he is.

128
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:02,916
Chucko, Chucko, Chucko.

129
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,711
You've been a very bad clown.

130
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,018
Enjoy your stay.

131
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,983
You think I'm scared?

132
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,319
I'll be runnin' this dump in a few years...

133
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,576
Oh, phooey.

134
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:46,126
Do you know what killed the dinosaurs?

135
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,004
Uh, no, sir.

136
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,881
Well, Chucko does.

137
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,467
And unless you want to find out firsthand

138
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,969
you'll go finish off the Justice League.

139
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,387
Skedaddle!

140
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,348
Time is money.

141
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,227
Actually, time is the non-spatial continuum

142
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,635
in which events occur linearly

143
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,581
usually in the direction of increased entropy.

144
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:10,109
But the clowns seem to relate better to the money thing.

145
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,655
Oh, Enid, look at what I've done.

146
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:17,116
And you always said I wouldn't amount to anything.

147
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,659
I guess I showed you.

148
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,371
Now, I've taken over Gotham

149
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,374
which gives me plenty of space to store my antiques.

150
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,709
Did you notice I took that stuff out of the garage?

151
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,586
You can park there now if you want to.

152
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,463
Thank you, David.

153
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,050
David, didn't you tell me it was dangerous

154
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,219
to take important things from the past?

155
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:40,722
That it could damage time somehow?

156
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,558
Don't you think I can handle it?

157
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,643
O-of course I do.

158
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,064
- Dear? - Hmm?

159
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,233
Do you know what would make me happy?

160
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:54,570
If you let my mother out of the thing like you promised.

161
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,655
We'll see. Rub my neck.

162
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:02,327
It's just that it seems cruel to keep her there so long.

163
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,288
Your mother was the one who always said

164
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,206
I'd never amount to anything.

165
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,667
And you agreed with her.

166
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,378
Whatever I do, whatever I accomplish

167
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,922
it'll never be enough for you, will it?

168
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,966
I just wanted you to love me.

169
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,677
I'm sick of this! I'm sick of you!

170
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,179
Wait, baby, please.

171
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,015
Isn't there anything I can do to make things right?

172
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,184
I sincerely doubt it.

173
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,773
We still don't know much about him.

174
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,942
Obviously, he's a time traveling warlord.

175
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,628
He's littered the streets with buildings.

176
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,279
He's stolen from other time periods.

177
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:38,614
He's not a warlord.

178
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,240
At least, he wasn't at first.

179
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,909
When we chased him to the old west

180
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,286
all he was stealing was historical trinkets.

181
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,416
He's causing severe damage to the space-time continuum.

182
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,002
The degradation is increasing exponentially.

183
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,211
<i>I've got something.</i>

184
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:54,498
When we were in the old west

185
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,465
I got a good look at his time belt.

186
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,475
I've written a program that should disable it.

187
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,179
If we can get close enough to upload it.

188
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,805
<i>If we can get our hands on the belt</i>

189
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,934
maybe we can stop any of this from ever happening

190
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,476
in the first place.

191
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,603
We could even undo the death of your friends.

192
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,605
Diana!

193
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,107
She never left the island.

194
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,485
Or she was never born.

195
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,111
Time is running out.

196
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,701
Literally.

197
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,084
We need to find Chronos.

198
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,419
How? He could be anywhere.

199
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,004
Sometimes the old ways are best.

200
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,422
It's not gonna work.

201
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,025
You don't know your way around here.

202
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,592
<i>A lot of things have changed.</i>

203
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,262
Are criminals still superstitious and cowardly?

204
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,596
Yup.

205
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,098
Good enough for me.

206
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,941
You're supposed to be the real Batman, right?

207
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,068
I mean, the first one.

208
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,737
I've seen history cubes about you.

209
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,782
Hard to believe somebody stupid as you ever beat the joker.

210
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,285
Maybe I'm smarter than I look.

211
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,381
Oh, terrific.

212
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,220
You've got some information we need, Ghoul.

213
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,140
You won't find me the talkative sort.

214
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,558
Hey!

215
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,648
Where's Chronos?

216
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,191
My arm's getting tired.

217
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,695
I can't believe I was ever that green.

218
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,953
This is how you interrogate someone.

219
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,666
And we've got 9,453 active jokers

220
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,336
organized into about 200 smaller groups.

221
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:58,962
I don't know where Chronos is.

222
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,505
He contacts us.

223
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,816
He spends every night in a different

224
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,300
one of those old buildings.

225
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,653
There's no way of knowing ahead of time where he's gonna be.

226
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,095
And that's everything I know.

227
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,388
<i>Everything?</i>

228
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,309
I wet my bed until I was 14.

229
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,561
Losing my patience.

230
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:19,441
I can't control my friend here much longer.

231
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,818
You better give us something we can use.

232
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,071
His wife. I know where his wife is.

233
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,782
Wow! Batman playing good cop.

234
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,408
Everything's relative.

235
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,049
Get me another box of <i>bonbons.</i>

236
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,686
Will you hold it down out there?

237
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,897
You guys are always fighting!

238
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,991
Enid Clinton.

239
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,411
We've got business with your husband.

240
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:13,662
What?

241
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,414
John?

242
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,624
Hal Jordan. Another time shift.

243
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,501
I'm up to speed. Carry on.

244
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,255
Okay, I'm starting to get a migraine.

245
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,132
We'd better get used to it.

246
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,426
This is going to get worse before it gets better.

247
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,095
Any one of us could change or even cease to exist.

248
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,722
That's why you have to tell us where to find David.

249
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,976
We just wanna undo the harm he's caused. You have my word.

250
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,037
We'll do everything in our power to keep from hurting him.

251
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,396
Between you and me

252
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:40,897
I wouldn't mind one bit

253
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,858
if he got roughed up along the way.

254
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,234
<i>Then where is he tonight?</i>

255
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,111
The Parthenon? The Great Sphinx?

256
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,697
He just wants people to think he moves around.

257
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,782
He always sleeps in the same place.

258
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,430
No booby traps.

259
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,515
At least none that my ring can detect.

260
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,350
Make up your mind, would you?

261
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,060
Anyway, it's safe to go in.

262
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,021
If we don't beat this guy

263
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:22,481
it's the end of everything.

264
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,734
- We've been there before. - Not like this.

265
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,336
What are you supposed to do when you have the weight

266
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,654
of the world on your shoulders?

267
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,323
Plant your feet.

268
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,302
I don't understand, with all of the places

269
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,013
<i>he could be why sleep here?</i>

270
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,183
Because a loser with a kingdom is still just a loser.

271
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,476
<i>See for yourself.</i>

272
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,939
Huh... Enid?

273
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,982
Nice on the stealth thing, lady.

274
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,001
Get the belt. Nothing else matters.

275
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,827
A real gentleman, isn't he, Dee Dee?

276
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:00,870
They're practically extinct, Dee Dee.

277
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:28,565
It happened again.

278
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,191
Look out! Monsters!

279
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,985
Fire at will!

280
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,789
Batman's not paying us any attention, Dee Dee.

281
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,208
He should be punished, Dee Dee.

282
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:50,920
Terry!

283
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:54,382
Terry.

284
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,823
How could you betray me, Enid?

285
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,368
Everything I've done, I've done for you.

286
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,911
Don't blame this on me.

287
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,704
I just wanted you to assert yourself

288
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,164
not destroy the universe.

289
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,022
Get away from my kid!

290
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,151
Chronos!

291
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,612
You are good. Isn't he good?

292
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,240
Look at what's happening around you.

293
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,242
Look at the sky!

294
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,453
Pretty.

295
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,997
Stay with us, man, we've got a problem here.

296
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,666
Right. You're right.

297
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,459
This calls for another approach.

298
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,338
You'll love me next time!

299
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,558
Where's he going? There's nothing left.

300
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,766
Yes, there is.

301
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,269
The beginning of time.

302
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:32,772
He can reset everything. Make himself into a God.

303
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,816
Only if he gets there first.

304
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,785
The Green Lanterns have a legend.

305
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,288
No one can see the beginning of time.

306
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:49,789
It's a universal law.

307
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,166
Write him a ticket.

308
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,299
No!

309
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,182
Uploading the program.

310
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,725
Make it fast.

311
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,227
Having a little trouble with the brakes.

312
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:30,705
That all really happened?

313
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,040
Think so.

314
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,250
Then, we won.

315
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,752
Everything's back to normal?

316
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,713
That's a nasty cut, John.

317
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,843
You don't remember going on a mission with us today, do you?

318
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,470
I just got here.

319
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:48,139
The timeline's restored to equilibrium.

320
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,683
We're the only two people who remember what happened.

321
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:00,568
That complicates things.

322
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,903
What happened to Chronos?

323
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,905
I reprogrammed the belt to make sure

324
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:06,699
that Chronos would never come to exist.

325
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,662
<i>You worthless, good for nothing</i>

326
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,539
wretched waste of space.

327
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:15,083
You invent a time machine and can't think of anything

328
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,960
useful to do with it?

329
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:19,295
I can think of one thing.

330
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,590
Worthless, good for nothing, wretched waste of space!

331
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,051
You invent a time machine and can't think of anything

332
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,053
useful to do with it?

333
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,681
I can think of one thing.

334
