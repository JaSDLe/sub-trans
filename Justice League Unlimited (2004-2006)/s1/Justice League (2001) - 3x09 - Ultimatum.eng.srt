1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,181
- Whoa! - Whoa!

2
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,869
The new Bermuda Platform's under attack.

3
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,038
If it collapses, we're gonna have the worst

4
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,290
oil spill in history on our hands.

5
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,460
<i>I've told those idiots to stay out of my ocean.</i>

6
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,504
ETA is three minutes, Aquaman.

7
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,007
Right behind you, Superman.

8
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>See you there, Diana.</i>

9
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,987
These geniuses, dug right into the Earth's magma.

10
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,631
Never occurred to them that there'd be anything

11
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,948
living down there.

12
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,872
Not to worry, fellow heroes.

13
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,584
The Ultimen are here.

14
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,129
Not them again.

15
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,291
Now, was that nice?

16
00:02:56,717 --> 00:03:00,221
You know, Juice, Superman was my hero when I was a lad.

17
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,223
It's not his fault he's getting old.

18
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:03,474
Old?

19
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,936
Old, but spry, sir.

20
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,187
Old, but spry.

21
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,572
It's, uh, really an honor

22
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,700
to be working with you, Wonder Woman.

23
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,618
Thank you, Long Shadow.

24
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,871
- Lend them a hand, brother? - Absolutely, sister.

25
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,875
- Flood! - Sea serpent!

26
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,062
Don't be afraid, Wonder Woman.

27
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,906
It's only me, Shifter.

28
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,034
Any chance you could warn me <i>before</i> you try to drown me?

29
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,828
We were only trying to help.

30
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,583
Can you make telepathic contact?

31
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,209
Do they look like fish to you?

32
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,003
Don't despair, old chum.

33
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,525
I didn't know you could do that.

34
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,235
Neither did I.

35
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,109
<i>Finding new sources of fuel</i>

36
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,406
<i>for an energy-starved world</i>

37
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,533
<i>is truly a worthy endeavor.</i>

38
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,328
But in man's quest to better himself

39
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,539
he must respect <i>all</i> of the world's creatures.

40
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,043
Including those poor beasts whose homes you've disturbed.

41
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,962
<i>It's imperative that we learn to share our planet</i>

42
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>if Earth is to survive.</i>

43
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,509
He's certainly... earnest.

44
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:04,303
I think the word is corny.

45
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,055
Our paths keep crossing.

46
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,224
And our goals are very much the same.

47
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,476
Isn't it time you accepted our offer?

48
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:12,186
Alright!

49
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,063
We're truly flattered, Wonder Woman.

50
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,273
But we're simply not ready yet.

51
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,762
All of you in the Justice League

52
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,821
stand as shining examples of what true heroism is.

53
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,656
I only hope that one day...

54
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,492
the Ultimen can live up to your legend.

55
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,536
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

56
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,914
Wonder Woman?

57
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,499
I-I think it'd be terrific

58
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,252
if one day we <i>could</i> join the league, but...

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,422
Maybe you could come with me on patrol sometime.

60
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,134
Oh! Oh, that would be...

61
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,511
Let's go, Romeo.

62
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,641
Mr. Lord, your Ultimen have taken the country by storm

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,142
these past six months.

64
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,436
- Why do you think that is? - Simple, Mike.

65
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,773
They're heroes people can trust, relate to, depend on.

66
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,191
They're not aloof.

67
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,569
They don't put themselves above us mere mortals

68
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,863
the way that some heroes do.

69
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,990
Are you referring to the Justice League?

70
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:07,199
Who?

71
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,888
But what about those who criticize you

72
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,634
for the millions you've made in licensing

73
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,954
and endorsement deals?

74
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,914
All the money generated by the Ultimen

75
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,267
is funneled back into the group

76
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,792
to cover overhead and such.

77
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,794
Fighting crime isn't cheap, Mike.

78
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,546
And even superheroes have to eat.

79
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,965
I can't listen to any more of this.

80
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,260
This guy's dripping more oil than that platform ever did.

81
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,971
And he has the gall to take cheap shots at us.

82
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,806
I know Maxwell Lord.

83
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,683
All he cares about is money.

84
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,560
Well, it takes money to do what we do.

85
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,896
And not everyone's independently wealthy.

86
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,397
Lord's a walking ego

87
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,983
who'd do anything for a buck and some free publicity.

88
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,443
If he's involved in this

89
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,236
it isn't about helping people.

90
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,405
I don't know about Lord, but I think these Ultimen

91
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,407
have potential that should be encouraged.

92
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,451
Especially Long Shadow.

93
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:54,371
I admit, they're a little overeager.

94
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,540
But they're really a nice bunch of kids.

95
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,424
So last night, "Inside Celebrity"

96
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,885
did a whole segment on Wind Dragon

97
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,853
<i>and Mr. Swelled-head here didn't even mention</i>

98
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,221
<i>the rest of us.</i>

99
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,266
When do I get to be team leader?

100
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,101
When your teeth sparkle like mine.

101
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,188
Kids, kids, you know you two play best at the 'tweens.

102
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,650
Your faces are on the walls of every 12-year-old in America.

103
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,444
I don't know about Shifter but I'm sick of being a teen idol.

104
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,529
There's more to me than just a pretty face.

105
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,033
Did I forget to give you the royalty check

106
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:34,370
for the new water-spouting downpour action figure?

107
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,083
And that's just domestic.

108
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,210
What-what I want to know is...

109
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,463
Why can't we join the Justice League?

110
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,549
Hey, it's alright. I used to think like that.

111
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,551
Used to? What happened?

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,096
I don't know. I guess I just started wanting stuff.

113
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,105
Yes, ma'am, but just because Wind Dragon has a new power...

114
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,732
Yes, I know, but-but-but...

115
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,278
I'll check it out, ma'am. I'll check them all out.

116
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,578
Come on, Giganta, how long are you going to be

117
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,247
Grodd's errand girl?

118
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,999
As long as he needs me.

119
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,168
I took you apart before. Why go through it again?

120
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,462
Because this time, I've got help.

121
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,924
♪ Bizarro's here to save the day ♪

122
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,574
Out of the way, tiny.

123
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,081
- You were saying? - Oh, poop.

124
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,254
Can't you see Giganta's just using you?

125
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,387
Me do anything for woman I love.

126
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,098
Even break her boyfriend out of jail.

127
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,934
And what's gonna happen then?

128
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,654
Good job.

129
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,533
Believe it or not, when I was born

130
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,786
I was small, sickly.

131
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:41,455
But lucky for me, my folks were scientists

132
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:44,041
experimenting with growth hormones.

133
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,627
Guess the experiments were a success.

134
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:50,798
- Where are your parents now? - Well, mom passed away.

135
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,050
Dad's retired.

136
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,886
Do you really think I could make it in the League?

137
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,722
Yes. Yes, I do.

138
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,850
But I guess... I guess I owe it to the Ultimen to...

139
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,772
Yeah?

140
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,649
Okay. Right away.

141
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,984
I've got to go.

142
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,493
How long are they gonna keep us here like this?

143
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:20,828
What's the hurry, sis?

144
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,955
Gotta get home and wax your mustache?

145
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,998
Ha ha ha.

146
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,917
Well, I, for one, have a date.

147
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,503
And I have to get her home by 10:00.

148
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,255
It's worse than we thought.

149
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:36,093
The Ultimen's cellular matrix isn't holding.

150
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,341
Wind Dragon, in particular

151
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,805
is showing massive cellular atrophy.

152
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,224
But they're all in the early stages of failure.

153
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:45,435
- How long? - A few months, a few days.

154
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,771
The progression will be painful.

155
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,700
We should do everything we can to help them.

156
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,608
<i>That's not our priority.</i>

157
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,321
But, Mrs. Waller, I really think that we...

158
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,782
Since when did your opinion count, Lord?

159
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,618
How fast can you get the second team up and running?

160
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,954
I swear, he still wets the bed.

161
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,206
<i>If we push ourselves, five days.</i>

162
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,792
Can I help it if I keep turning into a puddle all night?

163
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,043
- Quiet! - Do it in three.

164
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,646
<i>I saw her turning into Britney Spears...</i>

165
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,797
<i>But what about the Ultimen?</i>

166
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,299
Quiet!

167
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,507
<i>They're expendable.</i>

168
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,304
Great news, troops.

169
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,973
Dragon's new power is nothing to be concerned about.

170
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,142
But, uh, just to be safe, Professor Hamilton

171
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,644
wants to keep you overnight for observation.

172
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,439
- Overnight? - No problem, Max.

173
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,316
We'll be happy to stay.

174
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,275
What exactly are we looking for?

175
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,902
We'll know when we find it.

176
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,830
What is that?

177
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,290
Over there.

178
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,019
The clones are unharmed.

179
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,855
Security can't find a trace of our Ultimen.

180
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,400
But I want <i>you</i> to find them, Mr. Lord.

181
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,277
And bring them back.

182
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,965
They're not gonna trust me or anyone now that they know that...

183
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,284
Bring them back or I'm calling in the squad to put them down.

184
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:09,121
I want this laboratory dismantled and relocated.

185
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>No</i> loose ends.

186
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,615
You lied to us, Max.

187
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,367
I was only trying to protect you

188
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,870
from people who don't have your best interests at heart.

189
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:51,371
I've <i>always</i> been on your side

190
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,206
and I promise, I won't stop until...

191
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,043
Spare us the performance.

192
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,086
- Water. - Lion.

193
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,471
What'll it be, Max? Drowning on a rooftop?

194
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,181
Or eaten by a lion?

195
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,730
You are...

196
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:19,191
You're artificial life forms...

197
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,817
grown in a test tube...

198
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,737
<i>designed to be the ultimate superheroes.</i>

199
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:27,908
That's a lie! I remember my parents! How much they loved me.

200
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:29,951
I was with my mother when she died. I...

201
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,079
<i>Implanted memories.</i>

202
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,831
But I spent Thanksgiving with my father.

203
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,083
Actors.

204
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:38,877
How long have we?

205
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,838
You're... just a little over a year old.

206
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,840
The purpose of the Cadmus project

207
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,760
was to create a popular group of superheroes

208
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,096
who were completely loyal to the government.

209
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:52,099
Unlike those loose cannons in the Justice League.

210
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:53,892
And the clones?

211
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,938
Replacements for when... you wear out.

212
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,398
<i>Once they're complete...</i>

213
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,274
<i>the clones will think they're you.</i>

214
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,486
They'll be you, and no one will be the wiser.

215
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:06,613
How could you do this to us?

216
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:11,326
Huh! Me? This is so big, even my superiors are small fish.

217
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:15,622
- But I... I-I was just... - Following orders?

218
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,461
No. He's nothing.

219
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,088
We want the big fish.

220
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,530
- They're gone! - And we're dead.

221
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,366
They're here somewhere. They've got to be.

222
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,118
Rhino!

223
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,707
Tidal wave!

224
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,465
Take this place apart.

225
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,468
No, wait! There are other offices in this building.

226
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,386
Innocent people who...

227
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,739
- I'm here to help. - We're out of here!

228
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,924
<i>Need a hand?</i>

229
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,853
What's the point of this?

230
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,649
We'll never find Cadmus or a cure. It's hopeless.

231
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:09,277
Then what? We just die and let them replace us?

232
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,863
No one ever knows we were here? That we mattered?

233
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,367
I say we just bring the whole building down

234
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,077
right on top of us.

235
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:20,121
Don't give up hope yet, Downpour. We've got friends...

236
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,123
in high places.

237
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,001
You idiot, do you really think that they can help us?

238
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:29,214
Whatever's going on, we'll do everything in our power to...

239
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:30,799
Yes, power.

240
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,051
That's what it always comes down to, doesn't it?

241
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,180
And that's the only way we'll ever be remembered.

242
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,808
If we're the ones who take down the Justice League

243
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,476
<i>the world will never forget us!</i>

244
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,564
Listen to yourself. You're not making any sense.

245
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:46,982
You're getting sicker.

246
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,318
Translation, they're afraid to face us.

247
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,778
No!

248
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,740
As a man said, you're either with us or against us.

249
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,864
Where'd he go?

250
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,796
Light's out, old chum.

251
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,326
Nobody does that to my sister!

252
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:22,869
Do you hear me? Nobody!

253
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,921
King of the seas, remember?

254
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,223
You don't have to do this!

255
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:44,808
It's all I know!

256
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,602
It's what I was created to do!

257
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,312
You're confused, Dragon.

258
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,357
- The cellular degeneration... - No more words!

259
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,192
I'll suck the wind right out of you.

260
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,623
Look what you're doing. Look!

261
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,795
<i>Is this what you want to be remembered for?</i>

262
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,382
- <i>He was your hero.</i> - No!

263
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,179
He was my hero.

264
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,807
And a hero is all I ever wanted to be.

265
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,991
Project Cadmus? That's all you know?

266
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,535
Everything else is an implanted memory.

267
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,412
How much time...

268
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,788
do you have left?

269
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,790
Who knows?

270
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,683
We'll take it from here. The Ultimen belong to us.

271
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,686
- Belong? - A poor choice of words.

272
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,231
We'll see to it that their last days are comfortable.

273
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,400
We <i>will</i> take care of you.

274
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,195
You have my word, for whatever it's worth.

275
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,073
Alright, Max.

276
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,963
- No. - You need to step back.

277
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,884
Not gonna happen. Long shadow's with us.

278
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,260
Safeties.

279
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,479
Mine are bigger than yours.

280
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,943
Stand down.

281
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,986
He's free to go with you.

282
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,323
<i>For however long he's got.</i>

283
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,158
Who are you people?

284
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,202
That's a national security matter.

285
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,763
And if I were you, I wouldn't probe

286
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,413
the situation too closely...

287
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,748
rich boy.

288
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:41,776
Welcome to the Justice League.
