1
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,006
He's here.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,032
Where, Mr. Thorne?

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,002
Huh? Ah! There!

4
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,037
I-I-I saw him!

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,037
Clink What? What's that?

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,060
Take him!

7
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,043
Uh. Okay.

8
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:58,062
Uh, we split the take, 30-70.

9
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:01,080
Fifty-fifty.

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,071
Aah.

11
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,080
Uh, ah!

12
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,075
Ah!

13
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,093
Uhh!

14
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:20,074
Uh-ha.

15
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:23,063
How-how'd you do that?

16
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm the Batman.

17
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,151
♪ The Batman ♪

18
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,215
whoosh.

19
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,210
Surprise.

20
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:26,228
I'm touched, Alfred

21
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,198
but my birthday isn't until October.

22
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,210
It's an anniversary, Master Bruce.

23
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:35,237
Three years ago tonight, you first donned cape and cowl.

24
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,206
Crime flies.

25
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,215
Chop-chop. Make a wish.

26
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,236
I wish, I wish..

27
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:50,217
I wish they were here, too. Very much so.

28
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:53,246
To the memory of Thomas and Martha Wayne.

29
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,249
The reason I became the Batman.

30
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,236
'Chief Rojas, can you verify rumors'

31
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,231
'that it was the Batman who apprehended'

32
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:11,229
'crime boss Rupert Thorne and his gang last night?'

33
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:15,245
Do you know of anyone who's actually seen this Batman?

34
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,241
Because he's what's called an Urban Legend.

35
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,277
Why that cheeky..

36
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:26,253
- Bran flakes, sir. - Easy, Alfred.

37
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,266
The Batman's right where he likes

38
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,263
hovering below the radar.

39
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:32,294
You are not one to bask in glory, Master Bruce.

40
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,260
Well, there you have it.

41
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:36,267
In only three years time, our crime rate

42
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,259
has plummeted to a nationwide low

43
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:40,275
thanks to Gotham's finest.

44
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:42,260
Back to you, Jim.

45
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,281
Next up, billionaire Bruce Wayne

46
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,275
contributes an unprecedented sum

47
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,272
to Gotham's children's hospital.

48
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,277
And in sports, the Gators kick off a new season

49
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:51,313
with tonight's home game.

50
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:56,277
Which billionaire Bruce Wayne will be there to enjoy.

51
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,297
Your season tickets, sir.

52
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,288
Oh, to-tonight? Oh, but I had..

53
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:04,283
Work to do in the Batcave?

54
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:07,302
For the Batman to better remain below the radar

55
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:11,312
Bruce Wayne must occasionally venture above it.

56
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:21,306
Get anything on our vigilante this time, Bennett?

57
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,771
Besides the fact that he bat-wrapped.

58
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,314
Thorne's butt for us?

59
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,319
Well, it's up to you and your partner to see to it

60
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:29,320
that this Urban Legend doesn't become a folk hero.

61
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,316
Partner? Since when?

62
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,356
Since I decided two heads are better than one.

63
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:39,337
Detective Ethan Bennett, meet Detective Ellen Yin

64
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,337
formally of Metropolis PD.

65
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:45,367
- Their loss. - Howdy, partner.

66
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,335
Welcome to Gotham.

67
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,336
Now that you two are acquainted

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,357
bring me this Batman, whoever he is.

69
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,376
'Ahem.'

70
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,362
I know, Alfred.

71
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:09,350
Time for swinging Bachelor Bruce Wayne

72
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,360
to put on the party hat.

73
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:12,362
Rest assured, Master Bruce.

74
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,367
You're never far from the Batcave

75
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,384
with the modern miracle of Batwave.

76
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:31,412
Steiner, check.

77
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,401
McSwain, check.

78
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,419
223, vacant.

79
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,397
Hey.

80
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:48,396
No one logged any new arrivals.

81
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,402
Whoa.

82
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,418
What are you doing in here?

83
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,420
What the..

84
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,410
I was feeling a bit screw-loose

85
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:02,417
so I checked myself in.

86
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,438
Who-who are you?

87
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,441
My card.

88
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,441
'Huh, uh, no! N-no! No! Aah!'

89
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:34,452
Let me tell you something. Ol' bats never leaves a trace.

90
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:38,441
No prints, no follicles, no match on tire tracks.

91
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:41,441
- Custom jobs. - The dude has resources.

92
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,445
And a knack for showing up where crime is

93
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,449
and police aren't.

94
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:46,449
I've never laid eyes on him.

95
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:47,454
Just in.

96
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,448
An unknown perp released all patients

97
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:50,469
from the East Wing of Arkham Asylum.

98
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,467
What? That's crazy!

99
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:55,493
Crazy enough to lure a bat?

100
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:09,488
You know, I once toyed with the idea

101
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:12,511
of buying the Gators, buying them lunch.

102
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:16,513
Oh, Mr. Wayne.

103
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,516
Uh, pardon me, ladies.

104
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,511
Arkham?

105
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:26,598
'And among Gotham notables'

106
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,498
'we welcome the young CEO of Wayne Industries'

107
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,504
'Bruce W-Wayne, uh'

108
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,530
'grabbing a Gator dog, no doubt.'

109
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,527
No doubt.

110
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:49,552
Gotta work on those stops.

111
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,558
Whoa!

112
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,566
What the..

113
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:27,576
Zap.

114
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,590
That was theatrical.

115
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,631
He takes after his pa, wouldn't you say?

116
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:16,602
What did you do to him?

117
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,597
Just some laughing gas, drag.

118
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,643
Don't tell me you're <i>not an inmate.</i>

119
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,617
What rational being dresses like you?

120
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,609
Speaking of threads

121
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,624
think this is a good look for me?

122
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:34,613
- Who are you? - Joker.

123
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:36,650
Not what, who?

124
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,649
Smear-free. It's perma-clown.

125
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,632
Ooh, tough crowd.

126
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:49,636
Look! Nothing up my sleeves. Ha ha.

127
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,642
Nothing that won't put a smile on your face.

128
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,676
Say, cheese.

129
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,670
I'm out of gas.

130
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,680
And I'm out of patience!

131
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,650
You really know how to spoil a coming-out party.

132
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,655
How do you expect me to spread mirth and whimsy

133
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,658
without a proper hideout?

134
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:17,659
Listen, Joker, you're sick! You need help.

135
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:20,667
Well, maybe I am a little off.

136
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:21,694
Yah!

137
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:26,674
But what are you gonna do, lock me in the looney bin?

138
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,693
I'm already here.

139
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:33,715
Situation report?

140
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,674
We're rounding up patients and waiting for choppers

141
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:37,707
to take us over.

142
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:40,716
Like we'll get any drier?

143
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:42,722
Uh.

144
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,689
Huh.

145
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:48,727
My new partner. Triathlon Whiz.

146
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,712
You know, I really love this place.

147
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:02,721
My old hideout's a shambles.

148
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:04,705
Eyah. He-heh.

149
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,743
And these digs just scream me.

150
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,729
Okay, take back the asylum.

151
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:18,745
But mark my words, this town has happy days ahead.

152
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:48,787
Boing 'Smile, Gotham!'

153
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,794
Well, better split up.

154
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:09,789
You have the right to remain silent.

155
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:14,804
Bennett, spot the perp?

156
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:19,815
The Bat.

157
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:27,800
Sir, a stranger in the Batcave?

158
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,806
Tonight, we'll make an exception.

159
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,803
Oh, my, chap could use a dentist.

160
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:35,795
Or a medic.

161
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:36,831
Right, then.

162
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,813
'Chief Rojas, any suspects yet in this bizarre'

163
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:42,810
'jack-in-the-box hostage incident?'

164
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,846
'I'm not at liberty to reveal whom.'

165
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,810
'But I feel confident our best detectives'

166
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,809
'are closing in on him as we speak.'

167
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,855
And Gotham Gator fan Bruce Wayne

168
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,855
with nary an alibi.

169
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,815
How's our patient?

170
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:57,829
Despite the ghastly grimace

171
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:58,835
fit as a fiddle.

172
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:00,825
Poor fellow simply a prisoner

173
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:01,850
in his own body.

174
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:04,833
A sample of Joker's gas

175
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:07,837
is our only hope of deriving an antidote.

176
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:10,835
I need to find it before this madman

177
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,869
puts a permanent smile on all of Gotham.

178
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:18,838
'Smile, Gotham!

179
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,874
My old hideout's a shambles.

180
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,846
If I find the <i>old hideout,</i> I find this Joker.

181
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,853
'Master Bruce, someone to see you.'

182
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:31,872
Who is it, Alfred?

183
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:34,893
The police.

184
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,883
Detective, uh, am I under arrest?

185
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,872
Yo, Bruce!

186
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,870
Ethan.

187
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:51,055
Where you've been, my friend?

188
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,898
Master Bruce was at the Gator game last night.

189
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:56,889
Speaking of, I thought we were all set

190
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,882
to shoot some hoops last week.

191
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:01,912
Ah, I-I've been buried, Ethan, 24/7.

192
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,898
So, why the sudden visit?

193
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:08,902
Just... ne-needed to talk to someone.

194
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,890
Other than the guys at the station, I mean.

195
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,895
This is gonna sound weird, Bruce.

196
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,928
But last night..

197
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,924
I saw the Batman.

198
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,916
Only a Ming.

199
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,921
So, he's for real?

200
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:24,947
What's he look like?

201
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:26,924
A dude like you or me.

202
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:28,942
Except he wears Batjamas.

203
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:31,923
Tough part's this, Bruce.

204
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:34,917
I really believe the Bat's helping Gotham.

205
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:37,915
Even if he is on the wrong side of the law.

206
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:38,928
But he's getting a bad rap

207
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:41,944
and the heat's on me to take him down.

208
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,950
'Looks like a clown hideout.'

209
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,950
Stop me if you've heard this one before, Batman.

210
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,936
There were these two fellows

211
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,950
in an abandoned party favor factory.

212
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:01,944
One says to the other..

213
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,947
Where are you keeping the gas, Joker?

214
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,953
You call that a punch line?

215
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,958
I don't share your sense of humor.

216
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,962
Yet we're linked, you and I.

217
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,994
Like comedy and tragedy.

218
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,996
Two sides, same coin.

219
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,966
The gas, Joker

220
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,976
or I vow I will turn your smile upside-down.

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,991
If it's gas you want.

222
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,001
Place all tray tables in their upright positions.

223
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:40,999
- What is that? - Ah.

224
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:45,996
- It looks like a balloon. - Smiles, people. Smiles!

225
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,003
The balloon's filled with Joker gas.

226
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:51,029
'And he's gonna pop it.'

227
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,031
Over Gotham.

228
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:08,009
A balloon downtown this time of year? That's...

229
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,049
Crazy? I'll drive.

230
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,032
If you're loving me

231
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,048
wait till you get a load of my pop.

232
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:36,078
- Stop this thing, Joker. - With what brakes?

233
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,078
He-ah!

234
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:49,079
It's the Batman. And he's pummeling a clown.

235
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,071
- Ugh! - Aah!

236
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,065
The jack-in-the-box, Yin.

237
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,073
What if clowny's the one behind the Arkham incident?

238
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,072
Explain the missing orderly.

239
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,072
Maybe Bats took him 'cause.. Uh, I don't know.

240
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,069
Uh, the guy needed help or something.

241
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,067
Fair enough. We're chasing two perps.

242
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:10,093
One's a criminal. The other's still a vigilante.

243
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,109
Watch your pinkies.

244
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,117
Whoa.

245
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,127
East. Gotham Bay.

246
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:39,115
You have made me one very sad clown!

247
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:42,107
You.. Where'd you go?

248
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:45,144
- Knock-knock. - Who's there?

249
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:07,148
Ah!

250
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:25,164
Boing boing boing.

251
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:42,184
My precious gas passed by a party pooper.

252
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:46,200
I had a different punch line in mind.

253
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:58,182
'Well, we can take the clown in.'

254
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:00,213
I know you <i>love to swim.</i>

255
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:04,189
Alfred, move our houseguest out of the Batcave

256
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,225
and prep the lab. I have an antidote to whip up.

257
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:15,193
Steiner, check.

258
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:17,205
McSwain, check.

259
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:20,224
223, new arrival.

260
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,239
Check.

261
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:27,208
They all said I was sick in the head.

262
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,223
They said I needed help.

263
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:32,230
Well, maybe I am a bit batty.

264
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:36,246
Blame it on the Bats in my belfry.

265
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,281
