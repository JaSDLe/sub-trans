1
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,986
'And now for the weather. Hot, hot, hot.'

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,572
'Gotham City is sizzling in a heat wave'

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,023
'and there's no end in sight.'

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,030
Sweltering weather we're having tonight.

5
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:31,023
Uh, Skipper, what's our procedure in case of an iceberg?

6
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:34,026
An iceberg in Gotham Bay in this heat?

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,055
Little buddy, I guarantee you, we don't have a procedure for..

8
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,066
Mayday! Mayday!

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,038
Weather's a bit... muggy.

10
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:59,050
You are not welcome here, mister..

11
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,083
Uh, mister..

12
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:06,073
Freeze will do.

13
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:11,072
Mr. Freeze, you do not have permission...

14
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:16,067
Aah! What do you want?

15
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,063
Ice.

16
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:19,101
I-I don't understand.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,060
Think about it.

18
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,090
Think fast.

19
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:48,130
Have an ice evening.

20
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:46,167
♪ The Batman ♪

21
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,169
'All crime-fighting and no play'

22
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:04,182
make Master Bruce an extremely dull boy.

23
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:08,180
Even the Batman deserves to go on a holiday once in a while

24
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,171
'wouldn't you say?'

25
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:13,184
Alfred, you know how stir-crazy I'd be lying on some beach?

26
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,192
Which is why I've arranged for an athletic retreat

27
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:19,196
a way to hone the Batman's body and reflexes.

28
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,182
Not to mention escape this heat wave.

29
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,211
You've booked reservations, haven't you?

30
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:30,213
If I go, it's only to make you happy.

31
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,205
'The Batwave.'

32
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,198
The mind-boggling jewelry

33
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,213
theft here at Gotham Harbor

34
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:38,201
has left one man frozen solid

35
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,243
not to mention an actual iceberg floating in Gotham Bay.

36
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,206
'Little is known about the bizarre perpetrator'

37
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,224
'calling himself Mr. Freeze.'

38
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,226
There, you see? It's a sign.

39
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,236
A winter retreat is in your future.

40
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:30,280
What is that?

41
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,260
Will my husband be alright?

42
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,303
He's hypothermic, ma'am, but he'll pull through.

43
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:46,275
No thanks to that m-maniac.

44
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,285
So how'd he do it?

45
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:51,275
Not sure, but the victim seems to have been..

46
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,305
Flash-frozen.

47
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,290
He walked on water?

48
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,280
Froze it first.

49
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:00,307
Made a path of solid ice straight to the shore.

50
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:04,285
Well, no sign of that now.

51
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,317
Trail went cold.

52
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,287
Uh, so to speak.

53
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,291
'Trail wasn't quite cold enough..'

54
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:12,312
'Not in this weather.'

55
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,302
Not cold enough to the naked eye

56
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,322
but in infrared..

57
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,324
'Freeze's trail is a clear as crystal.'

58
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,346
'And his trail leads clear across Gotham.'

59
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:44,332
'Mind if I help myself?'

60
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,361
I didn't think so.

61
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,334
The choice cuts..

62
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,373
Must be in the icebox.

63
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,387
Ah.

64
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,386
Lovely little glaciers.

65
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,361
The Batman.

66
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:21,402
I thought you would never arrive.

67
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:30,372
I have been looking forward to our reunion.

68
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,411
Reunion?

69
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:42,408
Exercise will keep you warm for only so long.

70
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,440
Slowing, aren't we?

71
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,426
That would be the hypothermia setting in.

72
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,429
We both recognize the symptoms.

73
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:15,430
Reaction time slows, reflexes grow sluggish.

74
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,459
'Next come the hallucinations'

75
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,430
lack of consciousness, and finally..

76
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:22,452
The big chill.

77
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,450
Uhh!

78
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,469
You keep talking as if we've met, mister.

79
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,441
Victor Freeze?

80
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:41,474
But you're..

81
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,468
Uhh!

82
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:49,464
If I'm no longer living, Batman

83
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:52,454
you are the one who iced me.

84
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,494
Allow me to return the favor.

85
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,475
You, you..

86
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:08,483
I've had a makeover

87
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:11,499
'since our paths last crossed.'

88
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:22,503
<i>I was just Victor Freeze then, common bank robber.</i>

89
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:30,490
<i>But I'd hit the big time. Diamonds!</i>

90
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:35,498
<i>The biggest score of my, uh, former life.</i>

91
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:39,504
No way I'm letting some bat creep throw me in the cooler.

92
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:40,537
Wha..

93
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:06,555
Ahh-uhh!

94
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:22,572
<i>The icy hand of fate led me to that cryonics lab.</i>

95
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:37,582
Uhh!

96
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:48,595
Huh? Uhh!

97
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,604
- My diamonds! - Freeze, no!

98
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,615
No!

99
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,604
<i>I was electrocuted.</i>

100
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:14,616
<i>At the same instant the blood froze in my veins.</i>

101
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:24,617
<i>Was I still among the living?</i>

102
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,615
<i>Presumably, the experts will determine that</i>

103
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,643
<i>but I made their job easy for them.</i>

104
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,625
<i>My body had mutated.</i>

105
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,635
<i>Neither living nor dead.</i>

106
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,630
<i>I was a walking cryonic miracle.</i>

107
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:46,638
<i>Though some might consider me a monstrosity.</i>

108
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:50,641
<i>It didn't take much for me to motivate an expert in the field</i>

109
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:55,642
<i>to produce a suit to contain my frosty disposition..</i>

110
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,657
<i>Until I so choose to disperse it.</i>

111
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:02,647
Thank you for creating me, Batman.

112
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,677
Now..

113
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:07,657
Good-bye.

114
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,684
Police! Freeze!

115
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,683
As you wish.

116
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,677
- Uhh! - Uhh!

117
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:22,667
Another time, then, Batman..

118
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,696
Unless you catch your death of cold.

119
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:37,707
- Huh! He's gone. - But he left us a present.

120
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,700
Bennett here. Need paramedics... fast.

121
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:44,700
Hey, while we're waiting, we can take a peek.

122
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,691
Whoa. Hold up.

123
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,686
Can't say I'm not curious, Yin

124
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,722
but somehow, it doesn't seem right.

125
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,694
Hey, bats got into this pickle

126
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:56,119
'cause he was trying to stop Freeze.

127
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,714
I'm sure that Batman means well

128
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,710
but he's still a vigilante

129
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,706
and according to the law, Batman

130
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,771
that makes you a criminal.

131
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,717
'Just like the rest.'

132
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,744
Yin, hold up. What's that?

133
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,777
Something cold to drink, Master Bruce?

134
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,775
Master Bruce!

135
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,772
One hundred four point eight.

136
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,762
It's official, Master Bruce.

137
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:57,775
You are running a fever.

138
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,766
Freeze..

139
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,778
This earl grey will warm you.

140
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,777
No.

141
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,775
Freeze.

142
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,772
It's my fault he's what he is.

143
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:08,779
Master Bruce?

144
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,772
Yin was right.

145
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm not helping the law. I'm just breaking it.

146
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:17,780
Master Bruce, you really must rest.

147
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,777
Right, Alfred.

148
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,812
Maybe it is time for the Batman to take a vacation.

149
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,822
A permanent one.

150
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:40,830
Baby, it's cold outside.

151
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,836
You there! Freeze!

152
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:59,857
Wha..

153
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:07,863
Uhh!

154
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,864
'I'm a criminal..'

155
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,862
like the rest.

156
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,864
I should give it up.

157
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:34,859
Sir, I would be more than delighted

158
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,858
to encourage you to hang up the cape and cowl

159
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:39,861
out of concern for your general health and welfare

160
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:42,878
but you would only hold it against me once your fever broke

161
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:45,887
and you came to your senses.

162
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,904
'Master Bruce?'

163
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:37,956
Alfred?

164
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:44,932
Alfred.

165
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:48,934
Ah. Regained some of our fire, have we?

166
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,940
The Batman's needed.

167
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:51,950
I thought as much.

168
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,937
That's why I've taken the liberty

169
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,960
of weatherproofing your suit.

170
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,940
The crime spree of Mr. Freeze continues.

171
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:04,945
He was last scene entering Gotham Municipal Park

172
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,961
but the police, who entered in pursuit

173
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:08,982
have yet to emerge.

174
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,967
Let it snow.

175
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,980
Now don't forget your cough syrup.

176
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:27,982
We're gonna need arctic survival gear

177
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:31,007
if we want to get our men any closer to that dome.

178
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,003
Getting warm.

179
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,017
Vroom.

180
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:56,010
'It was all too easy.'

181
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:58,011
The diamonds. The police.

182
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:01,009
Challenges for an ordinary criminal.

183
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:04,046
It's clear now that I'm destined for more than this.

184
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,010
After all, you've made me more than human.

185
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:12,015
Sorry, Vic, but I'm done taking credit for your handiwork.

186
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,055
We both know you put yourself on ice.

187
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,027
I'm here to bring on the thaw.

188
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:19,027
Go on, then.

189
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,061
Bring it.

190
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,065
Ugh!

191
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,052
Wha.. Slick as ice, Batman

192
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:38,050
but I won't need to see you

193
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:40,080
when you're buried!

194
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:18,113
You're finished, Batman.

195
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,094
I'm king of the mountain.

196
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:24,106
The new emperor of Gotham.

197
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,097
So get used to the weather.

198
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:33,114
No, Freeze, this is my mountain.

199
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:51,151
Cold always triumphs over heat.

200
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,146
Two words, Batman, snow tires.

201
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,172
Aah!

202
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,162
Ugh!

203
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,173
Let's go.

204
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,194
Bats may be a criminal

205
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,176
but he's my kind of criminal.

206
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,180
Hot tea and a lozenge, sir?

207
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:48,208
Cold drink on a warm beach?

208
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,187
'The Batwave.'

209
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:54,209
Another time, then.

210
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,212
Tahiti will have to wait.

211
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:28,232
