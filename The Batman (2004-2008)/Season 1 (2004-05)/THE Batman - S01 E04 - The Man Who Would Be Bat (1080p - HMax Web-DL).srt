1
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:20,039
Screech

2
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:24,002
clank clank.

3
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:27,006
Hold up, the Batman nails thugs for us again

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,020
and this is the thanks he gets?

5
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,018
I just wanna tell him how grateful I am

6
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,044
up close and personal.

7
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:37,041
Screech.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,025
Imagine that. Lost him.

9
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,060
Hmm.

10
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,048
Coincidence?

11
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:53,076
If you were the Batman

12
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,064
what kind of pets would you have?

13
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,065
'Let's see where these bats lead us.'

14
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,083
screech.

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,050
Wayne Industries.

16
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:15,080
Looks like your buddy Wayne has some explaining to do.

17
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,130
♪ The Batman ♪

18
00:02:23,163 --> 00:02:26,142
ding Morning, Marlene.

19
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,162
Any messages for Gotham's most eligible?

20
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:33,137
Bruce, we need to talk.

21
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:36,145
Ethan. Uh, I hope this is a social visit.

22
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:39,178
Drop the act, buddy. We know you're the Batman.

23
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:44,143
Psych! Ha-ha-ha!

24
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,179
You the Batman! Ha-ha-ha!

25
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,165
We are, however

26
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:53,152
investigating a lead on the Batman.

27
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:55,258
We'd like to have a look in this building, Mr. Wayne.

28
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,201
Buzz buzz buzz 'Trust me, Detective Yin.'

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,163
If anyone here had anything to do with the Batman..

30
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:05,194
I'd be the first to know.

31
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,211
But if it's bats you want..

32
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,195
Dr. Langstrom is an audiometrist

33
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,194
an expert in the science of hearing.

34
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:21,196
Uh, bats are part of his research on..

35
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,208
Whoosh.

36
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,197
Sonar, Mr. Wayne?

37
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:30,203
Dr. Langstrom, uh, these are Detectives Yin and Bennett.

38
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:33,196
- Detectives? - Dark in here.

39
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,213
You aren't trying to hide anything, are you, doctor?

40
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:39,200
Bats are nocturnal. They prefer the dark.

41
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:41,202
That's common knowledge.

42
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,207
Dr. Langstrom, where were you last night

43
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,218
between 4 and 5 a.m.

44
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:48,212
Uh-uh, right here waiting for my bats to return.

45
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:51,216
I-I suppose I don't have much of a social life.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,213
What do you know about the Batman?

47
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:54,358
I never paid much attention.

48
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,221
But if he likes bats, he can't be all bad.

49
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,237
Hmm. Thanks for your time, doctor.

50
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,240
Mr. Wayne, we'll be in touch.

51
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,257
Later, Bruce.

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,232
Bats prefer being kept in the dark, Dr. Langstrom.

53
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:12,233
I don't. Why wasn't I updated on your research?

54
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:16,234
I-I-I'm afraid paperwork isn't one of my strong points.

55
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:19,250
And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to shut down your project.

56
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,273
No! You can't.

57
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,243
My niece Carly.

58
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,262
'She lost her hearing when she was three'

59
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,254
after a bout with measles.

60
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:31,249
She's the reason for my research, Mr. Wayne.

61
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:33,267
'You see, I'm on the verge of a breakthrough.'

62
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,288
'A cure for deafness.'

63
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:44,266
Are you quite certain allowing Dr. Langstrom to continue

64
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,270
his bat research was the wisest decision, Master Bruce?

65
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,280
Giving Detective Yin a reason

66
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:51,282
to sniff around Wayne Industries

67
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:53,289
could spell disaster.

68
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:56,283
Langstrom's on the verge of a breakthrough, Alfred.

69
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,295
In scientific terms, sir.

70
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,295
"On the verge," could mean years.

71
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,289
Then maybe Bruce Wayne can provide

72
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,307
some charity on a personal level.

73
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,313
Ding dong.

74
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:15,294
Hi. Carly?

75
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:17,312
I brought you this hearing aid

76
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:20,298
'until your uncle can... '

77
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:23,336
Mom! There's some total weirdo at the door!

78
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,306
You can hear?

79
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,347
Thud Langstrom.

80
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:38,334
'Langstrom.'

81
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,333
Dr. Langstrom.

82
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:42,364
No one here. Okay.

83
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,353
If you're not curing deafness, what are you up to?

84
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:53,374
"The Batman. Vigilante or hero?"

85
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,342
'Internet sites?'

86
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:01,369
'Police reports!'

87
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:07,386
Mr. Wayne?

88
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,352
Quite a scrapbook for someone

89
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,352
who's never paid much attention to the Batman.

90
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,366
Oh, don't trouble yourself, Mr. Wayne.

91
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,375
A pompous, pretty boy like you could never understand my work.

92
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,375
- Try me, doctor. - I want to be like the Batman.

93
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,371
You wanna be a crime fighter?

94
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:26,381
No, Mr. Wayne.

95
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:29,370
I want to be feared!

96
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:32,373
You forced me to accelerate my testing schedule.

97
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:36,396
A pity the Batman himself can't be here to witness..

98
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,412
The birth of Man-Bat!

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,417
Langstrom, take it easy.

100
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,433
Can you hear me?

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,445
Langstrom!

102
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,452
Crackle crackle

103
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:36,469
clank clank clank

104
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:39,468
thud thud thud.

105
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,475
Chill.

106
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:48,474
Thud

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,491
creak

108
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,487
beep beep beep

109
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,502
vroom.

110
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:17,481
- Whoa! - Check it out.

111
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:19,498
Even billionaires put in overtime.

112
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,512
Detectives.

113
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,514
Uh, excuse me.

114
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,496
- E-mail from a cutie? - Spam.

115
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,505
So, why the late visit?

116
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,496
We wanna talk to Dr. Bat again.

117
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,502
That dork act didn't sit right with me.

118
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:40,512
Langstrom? Uh, he's gone.

119
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,521
Flew right out of here just minutes ago.

120
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:45,508
- Now, if you'll excuse me. - Uh-huh.

121
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:48,512
Your social life will have to wait, Mr. Wayne.

122
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:49,528
Langstrom's hiding something.

123
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:52,516
We need another look in his lab, Bruce.

124
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,534
Ethan, it's late and so am I, so, unless you have a...

125
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,553
'Search warrant?'

126
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,537
Yin.

127
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,531
- Uh, we're on our way. - What is it?

128
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,539
Assailant with bat wings, downtown.

129
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,531
- The Batman? - Who else?

130
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,548
We might just get that chat with Langstrom after all.

131
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:12,567
Later, Bruce.

132
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:27,590
Screech.

133
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:49,575
Alfred, anything unusual on the batwave?

134
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:52,571
And I mean, freaky unusual.

135
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:53,587
Let's have a look.

136
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:55,585
Would the discovery of several mammals

137
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:58,592
found completely drained of blood qualify?

138
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:00,598
Langstrom couldn't have used fruit bats?

139
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,593
'Begging your pardon, Master Bruce?'

140
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:06,615
Let's just say I'm no longer the only bat in town.

141
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,628
Screech

142
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,684
thud

143
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,688
swish

144
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:27,709
thud.

145
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,692
I knew you'd come calling, Batman.

146
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:47,726
So, tell me who's the better bat?

147
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,699
This has to end now

148
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,735
before you start feeding on humans.

149
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,697
Oh, but I'm so close to my goal.

150
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:56,714
Two more doses of my formula

151
00:11:56,738 --> 00:12:00,727
and The Man-Bat will rule the night forever.

152
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,746
Clang clank clank.

153
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,726
Argh!

154
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,751
Freeze! Give it up, Langstrom.

155
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,734
I don't have time for this.

156
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,760
Poof.

157
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:26,751
Flush him out the other end. I'll cover the back.

158
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:39,781
Ugh!

159
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,759
Okay, Batman, where'd you ditch the muscle suit?

160
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:51,753
You are making a big mistake, detective.

161
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:52,766
He's right.

162
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,787
He's more dangerous than he looks.

163
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:59,772
Okay, so you're not the Batman

164
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:02,795
and you're not Langstrom.

165
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:14,804
Freeze! You, you bat thing!

166
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,805
Ugh! What the!

167
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,821
Bennett!

168
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:33,798
Swish.

169
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:36,800
You're gonna need more firepower to bring that thing down.

170
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:38,823
Wasn't trying to.

171
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,820
Detective Yin. I need a copter ASAP to track Man-Bat.

172
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:47,810
No, no, not Batman.

173
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:48,848
Man-Bat!

174
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:57,855
Beep beep beep.

175
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,849
Alfred, pick up.

176
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:17,839
Need I remind you we are not all creatures of the night?

177
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:20,847
Alfred, I'm on my way. I need you to prepare a few things.

178
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:22,849
'Sir, something's wrong?'

179
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:24,876
A friend is in trouble.

180
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,892
Beep beep beep.

181
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,888
Bingo.

182
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:57,903
So, where's the big, bad bat?

183
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,894
Out of the daylight..

184
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,917
Beep beep beep

185
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,904
'...and in its cave.'

186
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,933
Hold on, Ethan.

187
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,933
Beep beep beep.

188
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,989
Look out!

189
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,012
Stay back.

190
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:44,019
Time to see who is the better bat.

191
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:52,018
Clang.

192
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:03,029
Appreciate the save.

193
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,044
Splash.

194
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,076
Let's see how your sonar likes the look of this.

195
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,100
Splash.

196
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:27,093
I'm not sure what's creepier

197
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:31,088
a big rat with wings or a drowned rat without 'em.

198
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:33,090
Bennett, you alright?

199
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,096
Batting 500.

200
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,103
One bat nearly ate me..

201
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:38,113
One saved me.

202
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:41,103
'Let's turn Langstrom's lab inside out.'

203
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:44,123
I want everything tagged and bagged so forensics can..

204
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,111
What happened here?

205
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,125
Maybe Langstrom didn't want anyone analyzing his work.

206
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,111
And you don't know anything about this, Wayne?

207
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,112
Hey, I've known Bruce since high school.

208
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,130
He'd never interfere in an police investigation.

209
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:57,131
Right, Bruce?

210
00:18:57,155 --> 00:18:59,122
I like to think I help

211
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,127
law enforcement whenever I can.

212
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:05,125
Personally, I'm just glad we're back down to one bat guy.

213
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:08,162
Well, if Langstrom isn't the Batman, who is?

214
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:13,153
Later, Bruce.

215
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:27,189
In time, in time..

216
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,176
The night will belong to Man-Bat!

217
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,218
