1
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,007
Mummy's just come from the most awful party, princess.

2
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:16,011
The catering was a disaster. The guests were strictly "B" list.

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:20,004
And Carrie would not shut up about her trip to New Zealand!

4
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:23,026
Mummy needs a long, hot bath.

5
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,061
'Hush, Princess! Mummy has a headache!'

6
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,080
Princess! What is going..

7
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:07,069
Aah!

8
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:58,129
♪ The Batman ♪

9
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,122
'Third high-rise this week, all with the same MO.'

10
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:18,133
No prints, no forced entry

11
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:20,134
no physical evidence of any kind.

12
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,136
I'd say it sounds like our Batman

13
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,157
if he were a burglar.

14
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:22,186
I thought I set it on the..

15
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,217
The Batman. Freeze!

16
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,209
Hey, you! Stop!

17
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,218
Go, Bats.

18
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:48,210
Hey, Alfred, check this out.

19
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,210
Strix nebulosa laponica.

20

'A rare species of owl native to China.'

00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,219
'match the owl's talon span.'

24
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,220
Someone has trained a bird to perform burglaries.

25
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:03,229
Ahem.

26
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:05,242
Without suggesting that I'm not sufficiently impressed

27
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,237
with your deductive powers, Master Bruce

28
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:11,233
I must remind you that you have a gala fund-raiser to host.

29
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:12,247
Right, Alfred. Tomorrow night.

30
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:15,237
Sir, it is "tomorrow night."

31
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,242
We wouldn't want any guests growing suspicious

32
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,255
of how billionaire bachelor Bruce Wayne

33
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,268
really spends his time after dark, now, would we?

34
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,293
Hello, ladies.

35
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,285
'Beautiful. Beautiful.'

36
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:49,273
'Michael! Michael!'

37
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,293
'Over here! Over here! You're great!'

38
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,282
Make way! Make way!

39
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:04,322
The Oz-Meister is in the house.

40
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:19,300
Bruce Wayne, king of the castle, ruler of the roost.

41
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,318
- Have we met? - Cobblepot.

42
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:26,309
Oswald Cobblepot, of the new Casual Cobblepots.

43
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,309
But call me Ozzie.

44
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,317
We have a lot in common, you and I.

45
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,331
We're young, rich, and handsome.

46
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:34,313
I don't think I've heard of...

47
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:35,321
I've been abroad.

48
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:37,329
Just got back from a tour of the orient.

49
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:41,332
Uh-huh... I see.

50
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:43,365
Mm, and speaking of abroad..

51
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:51,337
Well, I, for one, have certainly heard of the Cobblepots.

52
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,351
My grandfather used to butler for them back in England

53
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,344
and they were an obnoxious lot then as well.

54
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:58,351
Grandpa Pennyworth worked himself to the bone

55
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,342
for those wretched snobs

56
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,342
and they treated him like a stray dog

57
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,607
then had the nerve to fire him!

58
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,355
'Get lost, creep!'

59
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,348
Ow.

60
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,367
Ooh... spunky.

61
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,395
Hey, miss, wait up.

62
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,361
How about some vittles there, Jeeves?

63
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:17,400
Crunch crunch crunch.

64
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,363
Hey... sorry about the weird guy.

65
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,363
Sure you don't want to stick around for the band?

66
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:28,369
Oh, Bruce! Amanda Raymont.

67
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:30,387
We met last year at the Earth Day thing?

68
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,413
'You know, uh, maybe I will stick around.'

69
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,407
Uh... pardon me.

70
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,397
Hmm.

71
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,399
You know, trespassing's against the law.

72
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,391
Oops. Busted.

73
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,397
Ethan. I see you brought a guest.

74
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:49,390
- My partner. - Hi. I'm Bruce.

75
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:50,421
Detective Yin.

76
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,418
Freeze!

77
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:56,398
You want to come in and join the party?

78
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:57,663
Not tonight. We're on the clock.

79
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,416
Chief's orders.

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,407
Keeping an eye on high-profile events

81
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,912
with that string of robberies and all.

82
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,435
Caw.

83
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:17,419
- Are you ok? - A bird attacked me.

84
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:18,431
Whoo! Freaky.

85
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:21,442
When I was a kid, a sea gull snagged my sandwich.

86
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,455
I'm sure it just thought your rubies were berries.

87
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:29,454
Hmm.

88
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:35,437
More shrimp, pops, and be quick about it.

89
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,444
And no skimping on the mayo this time.

90
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,449
I will have you know...

91
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,451
Everything okay here, Alfred?

92
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:44,451
I was about to inform Mr. Cobblepot

93
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,449
that his name does not appear

94
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:47,456
on the guest list.

95
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,460
Let me see that!

96
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:51,465
Hah. An oversight.

97
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:54,496
No doubt. But this is a charity event.

98
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,455
So if you wish to continue

99
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,472
devouring the hors d'oeuvres

100
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:00,486
'you must make the required donation.'

101
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:05,478
Is that so?

102
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:08,505
Here's my contribution, Jeeves.

103
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,493
'Oh, dear.'

104
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,495
Best teach the help some manners, Brucie.

105
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,487
That's what separates the Waynes

106
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:21,515
from the Cobblepots.

107
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:28,528
Ones?

108
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,513
The odd thing is, I was certain

109
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,498
I'd heard the Cobblepot fortune

110
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:39,497
had long since been squandered.

111
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,508
They had to leave England to avoid the shame.

112
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,513
I'd be a shame if you didn't get some sleep, Alfred.

113
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,519
And try not to dream of these Cobblepots.

114
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,516
And you, sir?

115
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,534
The Batman has some bird-watching to do.

116
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,531
I don't believe it.

117
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:57,533
My serving tray's gone missing.

118
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,563
That homunculus pilfered it just to spite me!

119
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,533
Well, Grandpa Pennyworth would have wanted to know

120
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,568
what became of the Cobblepots.

121
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:23,573
Vroom.

122
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:17,639
One of Cobblepot's girls.

123
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,634
Where's Kabuki twin number two?

124
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,672
Whoa.

125
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,687
Great. Double trouble.

126
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,703
Cobblepot Manor?

127
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,715
Well, you came this far, Pennyworth.

128
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,737
Hello?

129
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,726
So this is what became of the Cobblepot fortune.

130
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,745
Eew! Revolting.

131
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:19,750
- Aha! - Tweet, tweet!

132
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,763
I'm home, my pretties!

133
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:30,731
"High-rise jewel thefts baffle police.

134
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,745
"Dozens of similar crimes across Asia

135
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,741
"which suddenly stopped last week

136
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:36,750
and started up again in Gotham."

137
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:39,744
So Cobblepot is behind it.

138
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:43,749
<i>Just got back from a tour of the orient.</i>

139
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:44,786
<i>Let me see that!</i>

140
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,760
And he used my guest list

141
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:51,763
as a checklist for tonight's crime spree.

142
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,755
Alfred.

143
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,761
Alfred?

144
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,797
Huh. Maybe he's out running errands.

145
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:02,773
Mmm! Anchovies.

146
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,800
Ahh!

147
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,786
Huh? Who's there?

148
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,806
'Who trespasses in Cobblepot Manor?'

149
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,800
Hide-and-seek, then.

150
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:30,802
Huh?

151
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,828
Caw caw.

152
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:44,831
Oh.

153
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:53,824
Well, well, well.

154
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:57,827
Come to help with the dusting, Jeevsie?

155
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,831
Actually, I just popped in

156
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,838
to reclaim some missing property.

157
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:04,827
Fine, you can use it to serve me

158
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:05,838
more of those shrimp puffs.

159
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,840
The days of Pennyworths serving Cobblepots

160
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,831
are long since over.

161
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:11,837
Huh?

162
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,833
You're a Pennyworth?

163
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:16,841
And the only thing keeping me from walloping you soundly

164
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,839
is the shame that the news of the incident

165
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:19,855
would bring upon my Master Bruce.

166
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,844
Wayne, Shmayne.

167
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,856
The good old days when Cobblepots were king

168
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,890
are coming back, 'cause I am gonna restore the Cobblepot name

169
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,854
to its former wealth and glory.

170
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,855
Hmph, if you intend to do so by pilfering

171
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,865
it may take a while.

172
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,878
Not as long as you think, old man.

173
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,875
You? Birds? Oh, dear.

174
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,900
Uh... allow me to fetch those shrimp puffs right away.

175
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,909
Unhand me, you harridans!

176
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,881
My pets haven't been fed this evening

177
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,894
and they are famished.

178
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:03,926
But why feed them seed..

179
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,928
When they can feast on a treat of meat?

180
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:32,929
Ha ha!

181
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:34,937
Caw.

182
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:36,957
Ohh..

183
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:39,962
Huh?

184
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:43,941
Who's that?

185
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,931
What are you doing here?

186
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,950
Long story.

187
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:01,954
Oh, no, no!

188
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,962
Come back, my pretties!

189
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:06,969
Jolly good.

190
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:12,959
So, it seems the tales of the Batman are true.

191
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,961
But, really, who names himself

192
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,998
after a mangy flying rodent?

193
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,987
'Just one question, Batman.'

194
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,023
'How'd you find me?'

195
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,999
You left a trail of bread crumbs, Cobblepot.

196
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:45,992
Please!

197
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,029
Now that all pretenses are off

198
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,999
call me Penguin.

199
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:53,993
A flightless bird, but one with style!

200
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,022
Uhh!

201
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,004
My word!

202
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:06,007
A few tricks I picked up in the orient.

203
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,041
Huh?

204
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,019
I have a few tricks of my own.

205
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:15,036
Bring it on, rodent boy!

206
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,026
Huh? Watch where you're stepping.

207
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,044
Ahh!

208
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,074
Uhh!

209
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,042
Ha ha!

210
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,060
Ohh.

211
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,060
'Stay down, Penguin.'

212
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:48,087
Hah! And have you miss what's coming next?

213
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:56,056
Let me guess. A little something you picked up in the orient.

214
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,086
This penguin has claws!

215
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:06,086
Right, then.

216
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,125
Bird meets bat.

217
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:37,098
Huh?

218
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,097
Aah!

219
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,139
Boom.

220
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,128
Uhh!

221
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,118
There's a nice cage waiting for you, Penguin

222
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:52,137
in the Gotham State Pen.

223
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,156
As thrilling as it was watching you work, sir

224
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,126
from here on out, I shall leave the sleuthing to you.

225
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,132
<i>'Cause I am gonna restore the Cobblepot name</i>

226
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:05,139
<i>to its former wealth and glory!</i>

227
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:06,167
Waah!

228
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,147
Behind you!

229
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:11,162
Argh!

230
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:15,138
Uhh!

231
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,176
Aah!

232
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:25,158
Hmph. That is for Grandpa Pennyworth.

233
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:28,158
We'll leave this bird for the police.

234
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:29,190
Oh, dear.

235
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,158
And what of <i>those birds?</i>

236
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:34,190
'They flew the coop.'

237
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:45,199
Ohh!

238
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,178
Oh, my goodness!

239
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:49,184
That's game!

240
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,209
Dogs are on you, dawg!

241
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:59,180
Hey, congrats on the Cobblepot bust, Ethan.

242
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:00,186
You know, it's hard to believe

243
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,197
that such a big-time crook was at my party.

244
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,186
I can't take the credit for this one, Bruce.

245
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,200
Big secret, but Gotham's favorite vigilante

246
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:09,209
collared him for us.

247
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:11,200
Now, in some ways, man

248
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,208
I'm glad freaks like this Penguin

249
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:15,236
bring out the Batman.

250
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,228
Hopefully it's not the Batman who brings out the freaks.

251
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,229
Caw.

252
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,268
