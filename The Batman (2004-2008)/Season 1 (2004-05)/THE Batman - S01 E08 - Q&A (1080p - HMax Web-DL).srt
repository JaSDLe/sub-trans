1
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:13,001
'Well, they don't cut hair at Grocery Gil's'

2
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,036
but they sure cut prices.

3
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:21,015
So I'm gonna cut to the chase and cut the ribbon.

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,005
Hey, yo!

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,006
'By the power vested in me by the guys'

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,015
'who cut me the check'

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,015
I, TV personality Ross Darren.

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,023
Thank you.

9
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:37,035
Declare store number 235 officially..

10
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,032
Open.

11
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,057
Huh?

12
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:49,052
I always hated broccoli.

13
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:53,068
Ha! Gotcha.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,064
Whoa!

15
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:01,082
Slam.

16
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:08,077
Aah!

17
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,105
Vroom

18
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,109
beep beep.

19
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:07,128
♪ The Batman ♪

20
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:40,139
Before we continue, I'd like to acknowledge

21
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,150
some of the donors who have made.

22
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:44,147
Gotham's great concert hall possible.

23
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,170
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

24
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,166
And Mr. Herbert Zeigler

25
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,155
philanthropist and accomplished pianist.

26
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:55,500
What will you play for us tonight?

27
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,166
I play Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,199
Opus twenty seven, number two.

29
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,234
Beep beep beep.

30
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:37,295
Huh?

31
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,305
Hmm. Hope that buffs out.

32
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:12,334
Well, despite the glossier uptown venue

33
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,299
tonight's abduction has all the earmarks of this afternoon's.

34
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:19,300
'Both were highly theatrical, public humiliations.'

35
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:23,331
Oh, like those newfangled extreme game shows from Japan.

36
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:29,314
I sometimes watch the telly while I'm dusting.

37
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:34,314
No ransom's been made, so the motive must be personal.

38
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:35,324
Which means there has to be

39
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:37,331
some link between the two victims.

40
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,333
' "Match."'

41
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:41,324
'"Ross Darren and Herbert Zeigler'

42
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:45,330
'"worked together 30 years ago on a game show.'

43
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:47,339
A game show for kids called.."

44
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:52,355
"Think Thank Thunk." Put on your thinking caps.

45
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:56,369
I've d-done a lot of dusting over the years.

46
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:59,356
As I recall, the program was involved

47
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,381
in some sort of scandal.

48
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,380
'It seems someone may still be harboring a grudge.'

49
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,359
Psst! Bert, wake up.

50
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,369
What?

51
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,360
What's going on?

52
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,373
Ross?

53
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:19,374
Where are we? Who did this?

54
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:21,378
'Fear not, little men.'

55
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:25,368
'All will soon be revealed.'

56
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:28,367
Just one more piece of the puzzle

57
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,411
then the real fun begins.

58
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,391
'Put on your thinking caps'

59
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:39,422
'it's time to "Think Thank Thunk."'

60
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,384
'Sponsored by Kremelos, the gooey taste treat.'

61
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:47,391
'Now, here's your host, Ross Darren!'

62
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,399
Hey, yo!

63
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:52,399
Welcome to the show where the biggest brain reigns.

64
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:56,400
Ready to have some fun? Let's meet today's contestants.

65
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:59,418
'The challenger is Yelena Kleimenoff.'

66
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,411
'There's a mouthful.'

67
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:04,423
'Whose family recently defected from the Soviet Union.'

68
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,421
Good luck, Yelena. You're gonna need it against our champ.

69
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,453
'Artie Brown is the brain to beat.'

70
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,431
'He's been winning for 12 straight weeks.'

71
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,430
Let's make it 13, Ross.

72
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,440
'Artie Brown was undefeatable.'

73
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:23,463
And obnoxious.

74
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,443
The category is astronomy.

75
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:30,444
Artie, you can win if you choose a three-point question.

76
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:33,431
Three points, Ross.

77
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:35,463
Put on your thinking cap.

78
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,445
For three points and a win, name all 13 of Jupiter's moons

79
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,455
the person who discovered them, and the year of their discovery.

80
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,463
I thought you were going to ask a difficult question, Ross.

81
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,462
Let's begin with Europa..

82
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,451
Rizz rizz rizz

83
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:56,495
and Lysithea by Nicholson, in 1937.

84
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,475
Oh, so close, Artie.

85
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:05,467
Lysithea was actually discovered in 1938.

86
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,468
Thirty-eight.

87
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:10,489
That means Yelena is our winner!

88
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:13,481
'And here's your consolation prize.'

89
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:16,493
'A lifetime supply of Kremelos.'

90
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:20,494
No fair!

91
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:23,493
'Huh? Artie's mother claimed that the show was rigged'

92
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,498
'and filed a lawsuit against the show's producer.'

93
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,490
Bert Zeigler.

94
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:30,493
Zeigler had deep pockets and a lot of friends in City Hall.

95
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:33,497
The lawsuit was dismissed, Artie faded into obscurity

96
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:37,530
and Yelena became a world-class chess champion.

97
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,506
Sir?

98
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,529
Yelena's playing in Gotham tonight.

99
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,552
'This has been a very aggressive game so far.'

100
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,554
'Yelena Kleimenoff has control of the center'

101
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,515
while keeping her king well-protected.

102
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:56,531
The computer's been on the defensive

103
00:08:56,555 --> 00:09:00,529
'since the 10th move, when Yelena captured its knight.'

104
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:03,547
Bishop to B6.

105
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,524
'Bishop to B6.'

106
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:07,540
'That's going to win it for..'

107
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,567
What the..

108
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:18,565
I said, bishop to B6.

109
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,588
Pow.

110
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:32,581
Knight takes bishop.

111
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,617
Swish swish swish.

112
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,619
Pick on someone your own size.

113
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,620
Scrappy little fellas.

114
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,647
It's The Batman.

115
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:34,649
Poof.

116
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:46,656
No fair!

117
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,658
'No fair!'

118
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,676
Report.

119
00:10:57,668 --> 00:11:01,681
Then the games can begin, little friend.

120
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,649
The Batman?

121
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:09,681
Well, the game grows more intriguing by the moment.

122
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:15,656
This looks like someone's idea of a reunion.

123
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,658
Well, someone better tell us what's going on.

124
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,691
Quiet, Bert. He'll hear you.

125
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:26,672
Who are you?

126
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:28,710
The man you cheated.

127
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,689
Arthur Brown from the show!

128
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:39,697
Huh? Little Artie?

129
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:42,684
I was winning too much so you let her win.

130
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,700
You gave her an easy question.

131
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,708
You did?

132
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:49,700
Look, if this is about the prize money.

133
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,702
I'll cut you a check.

134
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:54,706
Money can't soothe the pain of humiliation.

135
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,715
Nor can my consolation prize

136
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:59,741
of a lifetime supply of Kremelos!

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,711
Though they are moist and delicious.

138
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,703
What do you want with us?

139
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,718
Why, revenge, of course.

140
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:11,754
You got to humiliate us. Wasn't that enough?

141
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,724
Relax, Ross.

142
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,724
In the spirit of gamesmanship

143
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:19,731
I'm giving you all a chance to walk away scot-free.

144
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:23,751
<i>If you can</i> defeat me in a rematch.

145
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:31,773
So, put on your thinking caps.

146
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,742
Artie Brown was a brilliant student with a bright future

147
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:38,740
but it looks like he threw it all away.

148
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:40,759
Dropped out of school, dropped out of life.

149
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,745
All over his obsession with a game.

150
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,749
You, on the other hand, never were much for games.

151
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,759
- Even as a child. - There was work to do.

152
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:52,777
Play <i>is the work of children.</i>

153
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,770
'And Arthur, evidently, continues to act out'

154
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,761
his childhood revenge fantasy.

155
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,762
Act or re-enact?

156
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:04,807
- I know where to find Artie. - 'Sir?'

157
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,791
Where would you start looking for a boy who never grew up?

158
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,790
'Put on your thinking caps.'

159
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:19,777
'It's time to "Think Thank Thunk."'

160
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,822
Hey, yo!

161
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,783
Welcome!

162
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,798
Now let's meet tonight's contestants.

163
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,798
'Three of the worst liars and cheats'

164
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,798
ever seen on national television.

165
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,796
Here's how the game works.

166
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,812
You've had access to my books.

167
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,799
'You'll take turns asking me questions.'

168
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,819
'If I answer wrong, you score a point.'

169
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:46,804
'Three points and you all go free.'

170
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:49,824
However, for every question I answer correctly.

171
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:51,823
'I score a point.'

172
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:57,846
Three points for me and you all get dunked in acid.

173
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,828
At this point in the show, we would usually break

174
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:10,849
for a word from our sponsor.

175
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:14,854
Don't you wish?

176
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:21,879
Err! Err! Argh!

177
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,880
Keep an eye on it for me, kid.

178
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,893
Are you one of Artie's friends?

179
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,888
Uh... yes.

180
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:07,926
Ooh, my, you're a big one. Artie's down in his room.

181
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,931
Thank you, Mrs. Brown.

182
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,918
Biff bam pow.

183
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:26,924
Now, now, what have I told you boys about roughhousing?

184
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:30,917
Orpheus, Castor, Hercules, Meleager

185
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,142
and, of course, Jason himself.

186
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,935
That's all 50 Argonauts, am I right?

187
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:44,944
That's one for <i>me.</i>

188
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:51,945
- Your question was too easy! - You trying to get us melted?

189
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,938
'Yes, yes, yes, please.'

190
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:58,971
For pity's sake, ask me something challenging.

191
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:06,983
Crash.

192
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,960
Hey, yo!

193
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,974
That would be two for me, none for you.

194
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,998
Better score or it's acid city.

195
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:31,982
In the subject of mathematics, what is the number pi?

196
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,992
Pi, of course, is the ratio

197
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,995
of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

198
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,990
But that number cannot be expressed as a finite decimal.

199
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:42,992
'But in the spirit of gamesmanship.'

200
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:47,996
I will recite the number to 50, no, 100 decimal places.

201
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,016
'3.1415926..'

202
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:01,039
46375.

203
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:05,021
That's it. I win, I win.

204
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,025
But more importantly..

205
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:09,025
You lose.

206
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:10,051
No!

207
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,013
- Oh, no, you can't! - No!

208
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,036
- This is ridiculous. - Artie, please.

209
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:26,039
Ah! The Batman.

210
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:29,036
Your timely arrival proves that there's at least

211
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,038
one intellect in Gotham City

212
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:34,041
worthy of Cluemaster.

213
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:38,042
- Give it up, Arthur. - Artie Brown never surrenders.

214
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:40,055
But in the spirit of gamesmanship

215
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,085
I shall give you, the Batman, one chance

216
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,053
to save their cheating lives.

217
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:48,064
A bonus round!

218
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,051
I don't play games.

219
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:56,071
But you <i>will play</i> or they get acid-washed.

220
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:59,060
Is this all you have to show for your life, Arthur?

221
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,078
'Bitterness and revenge?'

222
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:03,076
'You could have done something positive with your talents.'

223
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,069
'Like Yelena did.'

224
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,077
Bonus round.

225
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,082
Stop Cluemaster and they go free.

226
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:10,079
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

227
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:14,079
Is there <i>anything the great</i> Arthur Brown doesn't know?

228
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:17,086
You'll find out.

229
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,096
- What can I ask you about? - Anything!

230
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,084
- No topic is off limits? - History, science, literature.

231
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,090
Music, biology, current events?

232
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:28,088
Anything! Let's go, already!

233
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:29,101
Okay!

234
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:33,129
Name the true identity of The Batman.

235
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,105
- Trick question! Ask another! - You said I could ask anything.

236
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,131
No fair!

237
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,151
No!

238
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,142
Clang clang

239
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,154
slam.

240
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,141
Cheater.

241
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:07,147
Clang.

242
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:18,176
I'll show you the true identity of the Batman!

243
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,165
Swish

244
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:31,190
thud.

245
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:45,204
Would you kids like some milk and Kremelos?

246
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,184
Ah, Master Bruce.

247
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,184
I trust your bout with little Arthur Brown

248
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,186
resulted in your favor.

249
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,201
Alfred, I didn't think I was much for games

250
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:10,213
until I beat Cluemaster at his own.

251
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:15,234
So... think you can take me?

252
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:19,241
Let's have a go, then.

253
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,279
