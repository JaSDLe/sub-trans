00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,122
received a rude welcome last night.

Robinson Sprang has details.

10
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,130
The same Hideo Katsu

11
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,132
the Batman has been observing of late?

12
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:27,142
The same one I've been investigating without success..

13
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,133
So far.

14
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:32,143
Katsu's extensive collection of antiques remained intact

15
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,138
but, curiously, security cameras captured an image

16
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:38,169
of what appeared to be a costumed Catwoman.

17
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,156
What?

18
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,158
Joining me now is Gotham P.D.'s Ellen Yin.

19
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:45,163
Uh, detective, could there be some connection

20
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:48,154
between this Catwoman and the Batman?

21
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:50,148
While there seem to be similarities

22
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,168
in appearance and methodology

23
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:54,156
they have entirely different motives.

24
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,302
However, it's too early to rule out any possible links

25
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,162
between the Cat and the Bat.

26
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:02,188
This'll improve my relations with the police.

27
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,175
'I am most displeased.'

28
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,182

29
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,184

I missed you, too, sweeties.

35
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,215
Mama had to go shopping so she could feel better

36
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,257
after last night's disappointment.

37
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,234
You should've seen the prey

38
00:03:56,258 --> 00:04:00,245
a big, shiny pussycat.

39
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:04,226
Missed it by a whisker.

40
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,270
Mmm. At least my adrenaline rushed.

He looks tall, dark and handsome.

44
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:26,285

Well, this is it. So where..

50
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:07,303
Hello, good-lookin'.

51
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,292
Nice cowl.

52
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,300
Really sets off your chin.

53
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,307
I take it you tripped the silent alarm.

54
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:17,295
Only way I knew to get you to come out and play.

55
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,318
Well, are you coming down, or do I have to come up?

56
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:21,310
Mm. Purr!

57
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,337
Catch me if you can.

58
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,341
Zing.

59
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:32,346
Unh!

60
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,329
You can stop playing hard-to-get.

61
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:46,368
And give up the thrill of the chase?

62

Hate to cut our first date short, cutie

65
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:27,390
but I like to leave a man wanting more.

66
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:30,407
Zing.

67
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,415
'Hmm..'

68
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:50,409
Cute toy, Bat-bo.

69
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,409
Hyaah!

70
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,438
But corner a cat, get scratched!

71
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,429
Hmph!

72
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,414
Another cat fact

73
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:12,410
we always land on our feet.

74
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,433
Hmm... I think I'll take something

75
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:16,457
to remember you by.

76
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,451
'No way.'

77
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,476
My utility belt.

78
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,447
I know, Delilah

79
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,458
but I didn't take it for its looks.

80
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,489
I took it for the tools.

81
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,496
Hmm. Let's see.

82
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:08,508
Ka-ching.

83
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:13,478
Hmm.

84
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,510
This'll come in handy when I'm on the prowl.

85
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,516
Tap tap tap.

86
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:27,514
Got a little security feature, do you?

87
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:32,497
'You have found nothing on this Catwoman?'

88
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:34,507
'We must increase security'

89
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:37,505
'in the event she is foolish enough to return.'

90
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,533
Call for the Dragon's Fangs.

91
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,537
She wasn't supposed to be able to do that.

92
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:50,517
The belt's lock mechanism

93
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,515
must've been damaged in the fall.

94
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,557
This feline fatale is certainly proving

95
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,528
to be a sly one.

96
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:59,518
'I need to track that cat before she puts my utility belt'

97
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,538

98
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:02,544
Hmm..

99
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,566
Thud.

100
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,559
Goody.

Crash

102
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:37,568
Alfred, shut down the auxiliary bat-wave transmitter!

103
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:41,583
I believe this <i>was the auxiliary</i> transmitter, sir.

104
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:43,574
Come on.

105
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,569
'Start up.'

106
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,597
crash.

107
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,616
Okay, so what does this do?

108
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,620
Bang bang

109
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,628

110
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,620
<i>Abracadabra.</i>

111
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:18,615
Quick, disconnect the bat-wave receivers

112
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,636
from all the gear before she..

113
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:28,641
I don't believe this.

114
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,659
What good is this thing, anyway?

115

122
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:19,761
Whew.

123
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:37,751
Oh-oh-ho, scaredy-cats.

124
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,741
Hmm..

125
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,783
Can't wait to beta test.

126
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,781
And I know just the place.

127
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,797
Enjoy your drive, sir?

128
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,787
It had its twists and turns.

129
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,768
Are these all the bat-wave receivers?

130
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:03,769
Quite.

131
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:05,779
Thanks, Alfred.

132
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:08,766
If Catwoman were somehow, some way able

133
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,779
to trace the signals back here..

134
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:12,801
We would have to rename it, the Catcave.

135
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:17,789
An active bat-wave?

136
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:20,791
I was certain I'd disconnected all the receivers.

137
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:23,797
She took my remote control Batarang.

138
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:26,800
Maybe there's a way to trace the signal back to it

139
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:28,823
and Catwoman.

140
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:39,831
Click

141
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:47,834
ching.

142
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,834
The cat returns to Katsu.

143
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,843
How poetic. Ha ha ha.

144
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,833
Almost a Haiku.

145
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:16,840
I'll be sure to jot it down as soon as I get home.

146
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:17,851
I must insist you stay.

147
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,870
Then I must insist you eat steel!

148
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:24,870
Rizz rizz.

149
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:30,877
Ah. A dragon has many fangs.

150
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:37,858
If you inform me which family sent you

151
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:38,875
to steal my lion

152
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,880
I promise to make your comeuppance less..

153
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:44,895
Excruciating.

154
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:46,874
Family?

155
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:48,911
As in organized crime?

156
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,871
Yakuza.

157
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,875
Heh heh heh. Keep it.

158
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,886
'It is said cats have nine lives.'

159
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,919
Destroy her 10 times over!

160
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:03,910
Hyah!

161
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:08,911
Cling cling cling.

162
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:12,926
Better be some truth to that nine lives thing.

163
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:15,931
Yow!

164
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:21,940
'I should warn you fellas.'

165
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,943
Corner a cat, get scratched.

166
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,925
Mmm. Good-looking <i>and good timing.</i>

167
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:31,929
Yes.

168
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,954
You have something of mine.

169
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:39,920
Ah, she pilfered from you as well?

170
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:40,930
Take it.

171
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,947
It clashed with my boots anyway.

172
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,926
Click Now stand aside

173
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,959
so we may complete our business with her.

00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,941
The lady leaves with me.

175
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,948
Then neither of you leaves.

176
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,971
Attack!

177
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,964
Boom boom.

178
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,958
Shall we, handsome?

179
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,946
There is no "we."

180
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,982
Clang That's not what they think.

181
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:15,993
Zing

182
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,990
zing zing zing.

183
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:22,985
Uhh!

184
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,012
Hyah!

185
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,011
Ugh! Uhh! Ugh!

186
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:00,037
Heh.

187
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,005
'Ahh.'

188
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,041
Heh heh heh.

189
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,048
Creak Unh!

190
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:31,069
Hyah!

191
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:34,074
Huh!

192
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,074
Alley-oop.

193
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:02,104
- Thanks. - Thanks.

194
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:10,101
Ugh! Uhh!

195
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:32,133
Oh! I think I broke it.

196
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,111
What?

197
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:38,125
A minidisc?

198
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,137
Pretty important, I bet.

199
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,146
Uhh! Aah!

200
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:52,150
Catwoman, that's our cue to..

201
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,163
'Too bad about the statue.'

202
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,147
Hmm. Win some, lose some.

203
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:16,134
Just glad you and I got to dance.

204
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,149
We have so much in common.

205
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,141
Less than you think.

206
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:23,142
That's not what they think.

207
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,150
Ahem.

208
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:26,154
What? You got your belt.

209
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,146
Most of it.

210
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,186
Uhh. You sure know how to spoil a girl.

211
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,175
'A minidisc found at the scene'

212
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,179
'revealed a chart of Japanese organized crime'

213
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,170
naming names

214
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:48,181
with Katsu at the top of a Yakuza family

215
00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:50,185
intent on expanding into Gotham.

216
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:53,176
Detective, do you have a statement?

217
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,184
Rest assured.

218
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,179
Gotham P.D. is arresting the other Yakuza members

219
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:58,181
as we speak.

220
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,195
So, would you say the idea

221
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:04,181
of a Batman/Catwoman link wasn't so farfetched after all?

222
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,183
Yes, it's clear now that they work together

223
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:09,219
to take down Katsu as a vigilante team.

224
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:12,193
Ohh.

225
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:15,198
Not quite what I had in mind when I encouraged you

226
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,203
to meet women who share your interests, Master Bruce.

227
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,221
But it's a start.

228
