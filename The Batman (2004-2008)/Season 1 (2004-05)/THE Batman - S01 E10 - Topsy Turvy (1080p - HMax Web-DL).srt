1
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,038
Clank.

2
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:29,034
Hello? Sam, is that you?

3
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,040
Sam, are you working late again?

4
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,068
You! But I sentenced you, put you away for years.

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,055
You're supposed to be in Arkham Asylum!

6
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,064
Screech.

7
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:16,059
- Gotham PD. - In there.

8
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,087
But you won't believe it.

9
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:22,104
Whoa!

10
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:21,150
♪ The Batman ♪

11
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:42,168
- He's been carded. - Quick. Chip him out.

12
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,173
Crash.

13
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:54,180
Joker?

14
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:57,198
Go, go, go!

15
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:02,237
'According to Arkham, Joker's still locked in his cell'

16
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,239
'has been all night long.'

17
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:08,271
Perhaps Joker left some manner of decoy in his place.

18
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,250
Could be, Alfred, but other things don't add up.

19
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,243
Joker abducted Judge Wigzell

20
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:17,239
but not before leaving him for the police and me to see.

21
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:21,240
You're not expecting Joker to actually make sense, are you?

22
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,252
It was Joker's calling card. His way of announcing his plan.

23
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,248
Do you think there's more to come?

24
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,249
Maybe Joker's out to collect a full deck

25
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:29,265
of those who've crossed him.

26
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,266
Fifty one more victims? Where would you start?

27
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,299
One name is sure to be on his hit list.

28
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,276
The Batman.

29
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,293
<i>I'll lay the bait at Joker's last known house of cards.</i>

30
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:40,358
Not too talkative, are you?

31
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:56,356
Swish swish swish

32
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,394
squeak squeak squeak

33
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,391
boom

34
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,407
boom boom boom

35
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:41,411
boom boom boom boom

36
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:47,415
boom.

37
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,453
'Where's the judge, Joker?

38
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,404
How'd you manage to be two places at once?

39
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,421
And why the mime act?

40
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,428
You're a pale imitation.

41
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:13,447
'The real Joker doesn't wear makeup.'

42
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,428
- Don't hurt me! - Who are you?

43
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:24,430
- Nolan. I'm an orderly. - Arkham?

44
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,431
Joker said he'd do me in unless I helped him with his plan.

45
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:29,577
Gave me the keys to his place to bring him stuff and..

46
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,471
Who else is Joker after?

47
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,448
Pop Huh?

48
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,472
"Surprise?"

49
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:51,491
Boom.

50
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,464
<i>I left Joker's understudy</i>

51
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,474
<i>in clown storage for the time being.</i>

52
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,478
'Joker clearly didn't want him talking.'

53
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:07,485
Why not chip the fellow out and question him further?

54
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:09,481
Because I'm through being Joker's fool.

55
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,472
I'm gonna get my answers straight

56
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:14,503
'from the horse's mouth at Arkham Asylum.'

57
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,492
Seventeen leads so far from our tip line

58
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:26,496
each and every one of them a crank.

59
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,506
And Joker's in Arkham.

60
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,497
So for all we know, this copycat crime

61
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,496
is some kind of prank as well.

62
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,506
Well, if the next tip tells us our missing judge

63
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,530
is with Prince Albert in a can..

64
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:39,523
'What's this?'

65
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:43,513
An invitation?

66
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,541
Addressed to both of us.

67
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:49,551
What the..

68
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,515
Playing cards?

69
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,557
"For lots of laughs and a missing judge

70
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,530
"shuffle down to the old Gotham Palace Theater

71
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,532
"at 10 p.m. tonight.

72
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,558
Love, Joker."

73
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:17,554
'Well, I'm always delighted to speak to the press.'

74
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:20,545
'Particularly the Gotham Gazette.

75
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,556
Actually, I don't consider myself merely

76
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,550
a top criminal psychiatrist here at Arkham.

77
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,549
I view my role as the last line of defense

78
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,551
between Gotham and psychopaths

79
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,555
like Penguin, Freeze

80
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,558
and my prize catch, Joker.

81
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,571
In fact, I've been invited to a banquet of honor tonight

82
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,566
for Gotham's most inspiring citizens

83
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,574
'at Gotham Palace Theater.'

84
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:48,573
And I have just enough time to grab my coat.

85
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:51,582
Did I provide enough details for my profile?

86
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:55,598
Oh, you've been more of a help than you know, Dr. Bagley.

87
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:58,609
Pompous windbag.

88
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,608
The Batman! What if I hadn't been decent?

89
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,608
You're never decent, Joker.

90
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,617
Why bother adding a stand-in

91
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,634
to your card collection instead of me?

92
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,615
To drive you batty, of course.

93
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,611
And look, it's working.

94
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:30,627
Answers, Joker.

95
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,624
Do you really think I'd send a flunky

96
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:35,630
to eliminate my favorite sparring partner?

97
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:39,622
I reserve that pleasure for me alone.

98
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,658
Because I miss your company, Batman.

99
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,630
We're two sides of the same card.

100
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:47,637
After all, you knew where I'd send

101
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,628
my look alike to find you

102
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,634
and I knew all along that if I left a trail

103
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,645
of bread crumbs, you'd gobble them up!

104
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,641
Joker, you're not making sense.

105
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:58,651
Why convince an orderly to do your dirty work

106
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,656
when you could just have him unlock your cell?

107
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,681
Because you've always been my ace, Batman.

108
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,680
My ace in the hole!

109
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,666
What?

110
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,676
Poof!

111
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,703
I don't need you in my card collection.

112
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,701
I never play with a full deck!

113
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,708
'Nice of Nolan to bring some essentials.'

114
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,720
fizz fizz.

115
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,731
Makeup? Joker don't need no stinking makeup.

116
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,734
Smiles, batsy.

117
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:00,710
Thanks to you, I'm right on schedule.

118
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,725
Off to the theater!

119
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,743
Ta-ta!

120
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,718
Alright, Joker. Dinnertime.

121
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,752
Hey, how about a little mac and..

122
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,727
Cheese?

123
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,759
The Batman! I gotta call the police.

124
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:31,759
'The Batman! I gotta call the police.'

125
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,740
'All available units, respond.'

126
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:39,749
Dispatch, Bennett and Yin.

127
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:40,759
'The Batman's been reported'

128
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,762
'locked in a cell at Arkham Asylum.'

129
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,744
The pranks keep coming.

130
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:47,790
Batman behind bars?

131
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,784
Well, we still have plenty of time before curtain.

132
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:57,782
Snap.

133
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,801
'The Batman, huh?'

134
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:06,784
Seriously, dude. I do not know how he got in there.

135
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:10,774
- Or what he did with Joker. - Isn't that weird?

136
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:12,800
We'll take it from here.

137
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,791
Oh!

138
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:27,798
What, you think it's funny, wasting police time?

139
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:31,789
Uh, I wasn't kidding. T-the Batman was in there.

140
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,294
You're the one who should be in there.

141
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,821
'Come on, Bennett. Let's get to Gotham Palace Theater.'

142
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:57,818
I knew what I saw.

143
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,844
I'm not crazy.

144
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,836
Where'd you go?

145
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,843
Hey!

146
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,851
Oh!

147
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,853
If this is a crank, it definitely isn't funny.

148
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,869
Feels more like a trap.

149
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,853
Showtime!

150
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:34,875
Boom.

151
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,893
- Where? - Huh?

152
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,863
Detectives, get us out of here.

153
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,168
Alright, just hold on and we'll..

154
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,914
Theater with a sticky floor.

155
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:07,904
Welcome to Joker's Revenge-O-Rama.

156
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:10,929
Allow me to introduce my first guest..

157
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,901
Judge Horace Wigzell!

158
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,929
He's such a card.

159
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:24,918
I'll deal Joker a hand once I get my foot out of this shoe.

160
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:27,935
Easy, partner. Don't do anything rash.

161
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,914
Now, why are you here?

162
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,928
Because you all done me wrong!

163
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,932
Wigsy, you sentenced me to life in the loony bin.

164
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:41,925
Detectives, you arrested me. Shame on you.

165
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,936
Bagley, how many times do I have to tell you

166
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,932
I hate macaroni and cheese!

167
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:49,929
Oh, how I've wanted to deck all of you.

168
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,974
So deck you I shall!

169
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,975
Splash.

170
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,966
Go fish.

171
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,975
Joker, you maniac.

172
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,983
Huh?

173
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,991
Boom.

174
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,990
Ah, queen of spades.

175
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:25,972
- Joker, you better not.. - Don't make me slap you, Jack.

176
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,991
Get it? Slapjack?

177
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,984
Set nozzle to wide.

178
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:47,986
'Time for my favorite game.'

179
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,030
'52 pickup!'

180
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:56,996
Huh?

181
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,034
'The reviews are in, Joker.'

182
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,037
Your show's a flop.

183
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,037
Rizz rizz rizz.

184
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,023
Can't stay away from me, can you, Batman?

185
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,053
I guess opposites do attract.

186
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:19,045
Thud.

187
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,065
Let's chip you out of there.

188
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,034
Hmm. Chip?

189
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:37,054
Good idea.

190
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:39,077
'Cash me out.'

191
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,090
rumble.

192
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,053
Ugh!

193
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:58,069
Crash It's the Batman.

194
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,102
Thud.

195
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:06,071
Yin, let's get everybody out of here

196
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,106
before those two bring down the house.

197
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:19,089
You're going back to Arkham for a long game of solitaire.

198
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:22,083
Funny, Batman.

199
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:24,118
You're quick with the punch line!

200
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,129
Crash.

201
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,116
Sorry, Batman.

202
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,152
But Joker always laughs last.

203
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,152
Huh?

204
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,137
You gambled, Joker.

205
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,160
'You lost.'

206
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:20,158
Good evening, sir.

207
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:22,159
I trust you resolved matters

208
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:25,162
with the crazy crime..

209
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:28,145
Clown.

210
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,162
Oh, I walked a mile in Joker's shoes tonight and then some.

211
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:34,182
If I never see another playing card again..

212
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,187
Oh! Say no more.

213
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:13,234
