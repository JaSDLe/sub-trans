1
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,044
'It's time, dummy.'

2
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:40,021
bang Oh, careful.

3
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:42,029
You'll damage the parts.

4
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:44,022
Ah! Parts for what?

5
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:46,069
You gonna fill us in on the big secret, Wesker?

6
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,047
'What're you asking him for?'

7
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,041
'You got questions about my plan'

8
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,049
'you don't ask the toady.'

9
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:56,074
You ask me!

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,070
Now, put your back into it, punk.

11
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:06,047
Can you believe this nut?

12
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:10,051
Relax. There's gonna be one sweet payday.

13
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:12,053
Scarface is alright.

14
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,085
Alright? He's a dummy.

15
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,095
Excuse me?

16
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,064
Who are you calling dummy?

17
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:23,075
Do I look stupid to you?

18
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,108
Am I a moron?

19
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:27,110
Whoa!

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,100
Crunch Please, sir, don't. We need him.

21
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:45,090
Am I a dummy now?

22
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:48,089
No, Scarface. You're the boss! The boss!

23
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:50,117
Aah! Aah!

24
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:56,119
Don't ever forget it.

25
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:02,144
Now load the van. Crime's a wasting.

26
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,125
The problem with these knuckleheads?

27
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,141
They got no class.

28
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,203
♪ The Batman ♪

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,183
'Welding tools, motion-controlled gyroscopes'

30
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,184
and now, construction equipment?

31
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,201
They hardly seem valuable or related.

32
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:29,201
Unless someone's using them to build something, Alfred.

33
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:32,223
Let's see if the Batwave can't draw a connection.

34
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:38,228
Whoa! "Meet someone in your area."

35
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,243
Online dating?

36
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,218
Well, who'd have thought?

37
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:45,210
Alfred Pennyworth, ladies' man.

38
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:51,217
Actually, I was examining the website for you, Master Bruce.

39
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:54,227
Between Wayne Industries and your after-hours hobby

40
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:58,233
how else are you to meet women without criminal records?

41
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:00,221
I meet lots, Alfred.

42
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:03,230
I had three, maybe four dates just last weekend.

43
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:08,227
Indeed. All part of your swinging bachelor act.

44
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:10,243
But perhaps, it's time to stop acting

45
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:15,241
and let someone special get to know the real Bruce Wayne.

46
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,256
- I don't know. - Oh, very good, then.

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,255
Let's start with your interests.

48
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,241
Dispensing justice to the evildoers of Gotham.

49
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:27,263
How about driving fast cars, enjoys athletic pursuits

50
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:30,279
and being a night owl?

51
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:41,303
What? Do you have to look over my shoulder every waking moment?

52
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,266
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Scarface, sir.

53
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,273
He's not right.

54
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:48,274
Wesker's a little eccentric. So what?

55
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,307
That's how geniuses are.

56
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:57,283
Uh, s-sir, have you decided about the, uh, ranch?

57
00:04:57,307 --> 00:05:00,287
Huh? What're you jabbering about now?

58
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,299
You remember, we talked about retiring after the big heist

59
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:07,288
to work the land under clear skies.

60
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:10,288
What do you think, Texas or Montana?

61
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:15,296
Tell you what. You go to Texas, I'll go to Montana.

62
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,335
Always with the jokes, sir.

63
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:24,329
He'd never leave me.

64
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,360
Her name is Becky. She's a psychologist.

65
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,324
"I'm usually social, but sometimes I retreat to my cave."

66
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:46,358
Fancy that. Someone even you can relate to.

67
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,370
Oh, she's a doll.

68
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,331
Just don't fill out annual income, Alfred

69
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,344
or post my photo.

70
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:55,375
It's probably not a good idea to advertise I'm a billionaire.

71
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,567
'Gotham Air And Space Museum.'

72
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,346
Sorry, Alfred.

73
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,364
Looks like I already have a date.

74
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:10,392
Boom.

75
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:14,395
Hmm.

76
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:34,385
I still wanna know how this junk is supposed to make us rich.

77
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,411
Funny you should ask.

78
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,403
Been wondering myself.

79
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,428
- Who's that? - Beats me.

80
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,429
What kind of a nut dresses like a bat?

81
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,429
Your aim stinks.

82
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,435
Aah!

83
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:11,445
Crash.

84
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,417
Gonna stand there, dummy?

85
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,437
Oh, Rhino, looks like he has things under control, sir.

86
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:22,455
Argh! Out of my way.

87
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:30,438
- Yo, pointy ears. - Huh?

88
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:33,462
Say hello to my little friend.

89
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,478
Ugh!

90
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:52,486
Bang.

91
00:07:56,484 --> 00:08:00,467
Ooh! He's heading for more than just a pretty scar.

92
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,496
Let's go. Don't wanna splatter the suit.

93
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,525
Clang clang clang.

94
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:34,525
Ah! Nasty little puppet.

95
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,508
More potential dolls, I see.

96
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,509
I figure there are fewer dummies in Gotham than thieves.

97
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,519
So I'm trying to ID our perp through publicity head shots.

98
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:50,514
Oh, yes. He's clearly a smuggler.

99
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,552
And that chap screams embezzler if ever there was one.

100
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,517
There. Scarface.

101
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,530
'"The puppet belongs to a small time performer'

102
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:01,520
'"named Arnold Wesker.'

103
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,536
"One night, after an audience booed him off the stage.

104
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,528
Wesker and the doll robbed them."

105
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:07,544
Let's see if a search turns up anything

106
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:11,540
explaining Wesker's bizarre act.

107
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,539
"Care to chat?"

108
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:17,546
Bravo! Becky responded to your chat request.

109
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,577
And by your, I-I mean my.

110
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,550
'You have nothing better to do'

111
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:29,576
'while the Batwave completes its search on Wesker.'

112
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,587
Watch this.

113
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:51,576
So, uh, how things coming, Mr. Scarface?

114
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,575
Just need one more part, and that we swipe tonight.

115
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,583
Then we'll have everything we need to pull off

116
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:02,588
the biggest heist in Gotham history.

117
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,625
Aah!

118
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,595
Oh, he's good.

119
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,628
You bet it's a good plan.

120
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:12,619
'Signing off.'

121
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,647
- Well? - What?

122
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,624
I'm meeting Becky at a cafe tomorrow.

123
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:40,632
- But it's not a date. - Of course it isn't.

124
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,621
Merely the first step toward letting someone

125
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:44,660
get to know the real you.

126
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:49,640
You gave her the private number already?

127
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,674
Break-in at the Fewkes Computer Factory.

128
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:54,651
'What happened to us, Rhino?'

129
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:57,649
'We're taking orders from a block of wood.'

130
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:59,644
It'll be worth it, Mugsy.

131
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:01,660
Just keep an eye out for anything suspicious.

132
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:05,668
Like what? The bat got chopped into chip dip.

133
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:13,695
There.

134
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,715
Ah, the motherboard.

135
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,709
Here, dummy, keep this safe.

136
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:41,680
Only one heist away from retirement

137
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,701
and the clean, honest work of a cowboy.

138
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:46,685
'You know..'

139
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,725
Gotham Penitentiary has a thriving retirement community.

140
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:56,713
Where do you think you're going?

141
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,720
Texas, maybe Montana.

142
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:05,741
Take this punk out, or I get another partner.

143
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:10,719
Aah!

144
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:15,740
Buzz rizz rizz rizz.

145
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:22,758
Get up already. Get back in there.

146
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,758
Come on.

147
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:36,734
Enough with the act. Lose the dummy.

148
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:40,742
I would, but he keeps following me around!

149
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,758
This isn't an act, is it?

150
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:44,775
Aah!

151
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:52,763
Consider this therapy.

152
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:56,791
Dummy, he got me. I can't feel my legs.

153
00:12:57,787 --> 00:13:00,793
Ooh! Ooh! Coming, sir!

154
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,782
Mr. Scarface!

155
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,795
No!

156
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,804
- The Batman's alive? - Get him.

157
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:37,822
Sir, say something.

158
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,816
Hang on, sir. Please hang on.

159
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,839
Don't leave me.

160
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:01,831
Quit bawling, dummy. I ain't gone yet.

161
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:03,863
Got the circuit board?

162
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,869
Good boy. Now take me back.

163
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,853
It's time for the phoenix to rise.

164
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:27,863
Start talking. What's this big heist Wesker's planning?

165
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:30,865
The gold at the Gotham Federal Reserve.

166
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:34,854
Scarface, uh, I-I mean, Wesker.

167
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:36,898
H-he was building something that was gonna help us

168
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,877
'bust in and carry it out.'

169
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,904
He-he, he never told us what. Honest.

170
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,884
I think I know what.

171
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:00,909
Aah! Amazing how good a new suit will make you feel.

172
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:10,894
Go ahead.

173
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:12,890
For your non-date with Becky

174
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,899
were you thinking semi-formal or semi-casual?

175
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:16,894
Not a good time, Alfred, Scarface is headed

176
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:17,902
for the Gotham Reserve.

177
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,902
Scarface? Don't you mean Arnold Wesker?

178
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,914
You'd be right either way. It's no act.

179
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,920
Wesker's a genuine case of split personality

180
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:27,925
and Scarface is his dominant side.

181
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:30,927
Alfred, I'm not sure if I can go through with this date.

182
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:31,953
'Sir?'

183
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,914
If The Batman is my dominant side

184
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:37,937
how can I let someone know the real Bruce Wayne?

185
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,963
Vroom

186
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,966
crash Large and in charge!

187
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:43,011
At least it has a weak spot, Wesker.

188
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:55,036
Well, look who don't know when to quit.

189
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,027
Bang

190
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,038
crash.

191
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:22,055
I'm not through with you, punk.

192
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,045
That's right, squeak toy.

193
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:35,053
I'm unstoppable

194
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:39,051
and I'm gonna hit every bank in Gotham.

195
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,049
But, sir, the ranch.

196
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,050
You said we'd retire!

197
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:46,078
Yeah? Change of plans.

198
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,078
Maybe Wesker's not the only weak spot.

199
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:00,060
That's it! I'm retiring alone!

200
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:04,064
Be my guest, tough guy. You're nothing without me!

201
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:06,088
'Hey, Scarface.'

202
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:11,071
Ah! My eyes! My eyes!

203
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:12,087
'I can't see!'

204
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:15,116
Look out, sir. Sir, look out!

205
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,099
Crash Do something.

206
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:25,124
Dummy!

207
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:36,117
We were gonna go to Texas or Montana.

208
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,139
We all have places we'd rather be.

209
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,140
- Becky? - Bruce?

210
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:10,140
You don't look like..

211
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:13,137
That is, you seem different online.

212
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:16,146
The young man you were expecting apologizes.

213
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,152
He won't be able to attend, I'm afraid.

214
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:23,167
Let me guess. He's married.

215
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,169
To his work.

216
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,226
