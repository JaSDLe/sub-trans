1
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,021
'Master Bruce, haven't we discussed'

2
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:33,022
'not staying out late on school nights?'

3
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,030
What is it, Alfred?

4
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:36,028
'I thought it fit to remind you' of your meeting

5
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,025
'with the mayor tomorrow morning.'

6
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:42,025
'Actually that would be this morning now.'

7
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,036
The glass has been seared.

8
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,033
'Just like at the research lab two nights ago.'

9
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:48,067
Off you go, then.

10
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:00,080
Beep

11
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:18,098
ching zing.

12
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:23,072
Working late?

13
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:24,082
Midnight shift.

14
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:27,087
Like you, Batman.

15
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:32,101
Zoop zoop zoop

16
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,137
ka-ching.

17
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,166
♪ The Batman ♪

18
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:53,175
ching.

19
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,205
You're full of surprises.

20
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,167
I'm Firefly. Get it?

21
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,181
Fire and fly. Ha ha ha!

22
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:11,201
Zing zoop zing zoop.

23
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,230
Mm-mm-mm. You're gonna pay for that.

24
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,205
Next time.

25
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,231
Zoop.

26
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,229
Alfred, I've met our arsonist.

27
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,236
He targets computers. I'm not sure why.

28
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,238
But he has a jetpack and laser technology

29
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:03,222
like nothing I've ever..

30
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,263
Alfred.

31
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,265
Firefly, huh?

32
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,256
Ha-ha. Don't let that photograph fool you, Bruce.

33
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,249
I may be holding that fish, but your father caught it.

34
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:28,290
Dad always did subscribe to charity, Mayor Grange.

35
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,259
Bruce, it's been too long.

36
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:37,257
But unfortunately I didn't call you here for a social visit.

37
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,274
Wayne Foundation business?

38
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:41,269
Bruce, there's no easy way to say this.

39
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:44,266
As you may know, the city's about to award the contract

40
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,277
to rebuild and expand the children's hospital.

41
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,269
Right. To the Wayne Foundation.

42
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:53,286
The city council is leaning toward GothCorp.

43
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,280
- What? - Bruce...

44
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,278
Wayne Industries and the foundation have supported

45
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,944
the children's hospital from the beginning

46
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,284
since my father founded it.

47
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:04,285
GothCorp isn't known for its acts of public service.

48
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:07,289
They're known for allegations, investigations, resignations.

49
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:08,303
Too many "ations" for my taste.

50
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,304
Bruce, the council isn't concerned

51
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,326
with GothCorp's reputation.

52
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,308
They're leery of yours.

53
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:22,317
- Mine? - Your public image.

54
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:25,323
Well, let's just say it doesn't inspire much confidence.

55
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:29,308
Look, your father was one of my closest friends.

56
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:30,326
I see him in you.

57
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,355
But the council, they see you as, well..

58
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,332
A party boy.

59
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:39,319
Mayor Grange, let me make the case for the Wayne Foundation.

60
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,352
Give me the chance to convince them.

61
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:45,339
Please.

62
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:49,332
The council's voting on the contract tomorrow at 8 a.m.

63
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:50,372
Sharp!

64
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,333
And wear a tie.

65
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,373
I'll be here at the top of my game.

66
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:04,344
8 a.m. is bright and early for you, Master Bruce.

67
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:06,365
Perhaps you should think about getting some rest.

68
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,391
No, not until I've gathered enough ammo regarding.

69
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,356
GothCorp's questionable business practices.

70
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,398
The children's hospital was my father's personal cause, Alfred.

71
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,398
I need to be certain I can sway the council's vote.

72
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:22,404
The Batwave.

73
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,372
Police alert.

74
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,757
The security system of a law firm's

75
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,367
been tripped.

76
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,371
On the 64th floor?

77
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,382
Firefly.

78
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:36,388
Ah, I-I-I can't be in two places at once.

79
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:40,381
I'm quite the researcher, you know, sir.

80
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,421
Thank you, Alfred. I won't be long.

81
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,421
Crack

82
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,438
click zing

83
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,454
beep.

84
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,436
Firefly's work, alright.

85
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,454
But a law firm doesn't fit the profile.

86
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,472
Well, well, so the bat has wings.

87
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:44,468
Zoop.

88
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:58,480
You got some wings, let's play some chicken.

89
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,503
Oh, no.

90
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,504
Boom.

91
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:09,483
Tear gas? I'll give you something to cry about.

92
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:15,507
Zoop zoop zoop zoop boom

93
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,515
zoop

94
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,523
boom boom boom

95
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,527
zoop.

96
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,529
He's toying with me.

97
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,545
Zoop zoop zoop.

98
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,530
So long, Batman.

99
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,549
Crash.

100
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:58,518
'Master Bruce?'

101
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,539
'Master Bruce, are you there?'

102
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,553
'Please answer.'

103
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,533
Unh.

104
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:09,549
'Master Bruce, are you alright?'

105
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,575
Alfred..

106
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,542
'I've been trying to reach you for hours.'

107
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,577
- 'The communicator wasn't... ' - Hours?

108
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,556
Alfred, what time is it?

109
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,569
'Five minutes to 8:00.'

110
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,592
<i>The council's voting on the contract 8 a.m.</i>

111
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,575
<i>Sharp!</i>

112
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,564
- Do you have the research? - In the Batmobile.

113
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:39,750
With a fresh change of clothes and your electric razor.

114
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,607
Don't forget the tie.

115
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:48,596
Click.

116
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,603
Wait! Oh, wait, you blasted machine!

117
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:36,655
Great. No tie.

118
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:44,647
Screech.

119
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,670
Of course, I don't know how..

120
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,674
'Council members..'

121
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,654
ah, uh, ahem.

122
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,649
Um, forgive me for running late, gentlemen.

123
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,657
I, uh, I had a fender-bender on the way

124
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,670
but I'm here now, and I've prepared...

125
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:16,697
I'm sorry, Bruce.

126
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:20,691
The vote has been cast.

127
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,704
I... see.

128
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,692
Thank you, council members.

129
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,714
Well, he's no Thomas Wayne.

130
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,725
I failed twice today, Alfred.

131
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,695
As the Batman, and as Bruce Wayne.

132
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,689
I tried to do everything

133
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,705
and failed to accomplish anything.

134
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:54,737
You are, after all, only one man, Master Bruce.

135
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,714
Then maybe it's time to turn Wayne Industries over to someone

136
00:11:57,738 --> 00:12:00,713
capable of running the business side of things.

137
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:04,710
Maybe it's time to be a full-time Batman.

138
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,740
Or a full-time Bruce Wayne.

139
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:15,948
Police are still investigating

140
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,718
this stream of arsons plaguing Gotham.

141
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:19,736
The latest victim is a law firm

142
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,736
which represents many of Gotham's industrial clients.

143
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,728
'The firm handled several major bankruptcy cases'

144
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,729
including those of Gotham Telecommunications..

145
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:29,730
Bankruptcy?

146
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:31,774
Those companies were arson victims, too.

147
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:35,778
"Gotham Telecom

148
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,749
declares bankruptcy after arson!"

149
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:41,778
Who'd profit from these companies being out of business?

150
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:47,747
GothCorp, that's who.

151
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,753
It was staring me in the face the whole time.

152
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,749
Firefly doesn't commit arson.

153
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:52,766
He commits corporate sabotage

154
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,753
and he's working for GothCorp.

155
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,762
It's no wonder that GothCorp is so interested

156
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,761
in funding the children's hospital.

157
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:00,772
Nothing like a little good PR

158
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:03,762
to distract the public from dirty business.

159
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:06,765
Perhaps the batman and Bruce Wayne can work together

160
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,770
to stop Firefly and GothCorp.

161
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,814
The Batman will fight fire with fire.

162
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,786
But first Bruce Wayne needs to lead

163
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,778
a certain moth to flame.

164
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:21,784
And in business, local billionaire Bruce Wayne

165
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:22,797
stepped into the spotlight again

166
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:25,799
this time with breaking news at Wayne Industries.

167
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:28,806
I can't reveal any details yet but, in the next few days

168
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,801
Wayne Industries will unveil a prototype

169
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:33,812
that will make us the premier technologies company in Gotham.

170
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:36,815
In fact, it'll set the tech world on fire.

171
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,815
Are you concerned about competition from GothCorp?

172
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,834
Let's just say I wouldn't want to be GothCorp right now.

173
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:49,823
Yeah, I'm watchin' it.

174
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,829
No problem.

175
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,819
My usual rate.

176
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,831
I understand, like the others.

177
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:59,857
Wayne Industries will go down in flames.

178
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,866
Zoop.

179
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:46,865
Firefly.

180
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:50,876
Batman. Ha-ha, I see you survived your crackup.

181
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,877
I know about GothCorp.

182
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,892
What? Is that a rock band or somethin'?

183
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,876
For someone who gets his kicks scorching tech companies

184
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,916
hard to believe you've never heard of them.

185
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,925
Zing Yaah!

186
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,902
You're done, firefly. Cooked.

187
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,914
Says who? Ha-ha-ha!

188
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:14,907
Boom No one touches me in the sky.

189
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,929
Click.

190
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:24,942
- What? - This time I brought the heat.

191
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:27,932
Whoosh

192
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,946
zoop zoop zoop.

193
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:48,947
Handles nice. But does it have horsepower?

194
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,973
Zoop

195
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:10,972
zoop zoop zoop.

196
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,003
Aaah!

197
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:35,007
I'm moving to Metropolis.

198
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:44,019
Cling zoop Huh? Aah!

199
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:49,022
Zoop zoop

200
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,032
honk

201
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,049
zoop zoop zoop

202
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:28,065
screech

203
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:34,061
crash.

204
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,084
Last chance, Firefly.

205
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,049
Huh?

206
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:50,058
You're empty.

207
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,084
Ka-ching.

208
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:59,078
Just you and me.

209
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,094
Aah!

210
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:13,094
- No one touches me. - In the sky?

211
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,115
Grraaah!

212
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,121
Unh!

213
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,091
Uhh!

214
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:36,122
Aah! Unh!

215
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:44,101
Face facts, Firefly.

216
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,133
You've been burned.

217
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:01,145
'"GothCorp employee of the month."'

218
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,147
Well, based on recent, uh, facts

219
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:11,133
that have come to light

220
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:14,137
I suggest that the council recast their vote

221
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,143
in the matter of the children's hospital

222
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:21,166
as well as all contracts currently held by GothCorp.

223
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,185
Yes, well..

224
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,149
Bruce, your father would be

225
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:35,166
proud of you if he were here today.

226
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,166
Thank you, Mayor Grange.

227
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,198
I like to think there's more to me than a good-looking tie.

228
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:09,212
