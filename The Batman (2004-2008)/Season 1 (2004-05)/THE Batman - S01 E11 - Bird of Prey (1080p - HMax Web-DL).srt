1
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,039
Heh heh heh heh.

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,016
Yes, my pretties.

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,011
Show me the money!

4
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,049
Heh heh heh heh.

5
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,049
Huh? Huh?

6
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:40,046
Zap zap zap.

7
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:45,042
Sorry to rain on your parade, Penguin.

8
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:49,058
Heh. I'm always prepared for inclement weather.

9
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,077
Chop-chop, Batman. Waah!

10
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:24,085
A Bat without wings? Heh heh heh heh.

11
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,100
Vroom.

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,104
Aah!

13
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:47,116
Oh! Ow! Whoa! Aah! Uhn!

14
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:54,122
Yeech. Huh. What?

15
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,113
Back to your cage, Penguin.

16
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:02,100
Not before we rattle yours.

17
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:03,121
"We?"

18
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:06,144
Unh. Ah!

19
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:09,192
♪ The Batman ♪

20
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:34,211
For once, I have got to pull a job some place that Batman isn't.

21
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,235
Huh? Stop the car!

22
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,215
'He's known by many labels.'

23
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,222
'Billionaire, philanthropist, socialite.'

24
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:46,222
'But who is the real Bruce Wayne?'

25
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:48,251
You.

26
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,254
'Despite a larger-than-life public persona'

27
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:56,229
'Bruce Wayne has privately managed to remain... a mystery.'

28
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:57,234
Baah!

29
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:59,221
'Join me, Melanie Bramwell'

30
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:00,238
for the first-ever in-depth interview

31
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:03,222
with Gotham's most-eligible bachelor

32
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:06,266
next Tuesday at 9:00 on "A Day In The Life.."

33
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:13,251
If there's anyone I despise more than the Batman

34
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:18,279
it's Wayne! He's got looks and money.

35
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:26,245
Yes, money.

36
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:28,291
Wayne's money.

37
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:50,269
Oh, it's about time, Master Bruce.

38
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,275
The television people will be here any moment.

39
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,289
You sure I have to go through with this, Alfred?

40
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:57,276
Need I remind you, it's vitally important

41
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,298
that you cultivate your public image.

42
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:02,284
But Melanie Bramwell has a reputation

43
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,286
for making private lives a little too public.

44
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,288
I could be flirting with disaster.

45
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,299
Yes, well, unfortunately, avoiding the press

46
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,295
only piques their curiosity.

47
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,333
Oh, fine. When is this thing supposed to start?

48
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,335
"A Day In The Life.." From breakfast to bedtime.

49
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:25,319
Heh.

50
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:28,350
You... are gonna edit this part out right?

51
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,321
Don't count on it.

52
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:34,312
I pride myself on catching my subjects off-guard.

53
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:38,329
After all, I'm here to get to know the real Bruce Wayne.

54
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:41,331
- Nice digs. - Roomy.

55
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,335
Well, wait till you see my office.

56
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,340
I'll show you the rest of the mansion after dinner.

57
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,348
To Wayne Industries, then.

58
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,375
Ah, it's hours until dinnertime.

59
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,350
Coming! Coming.

60
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,366
Back so... Soon?

61
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,376
Longtime no see, jeeves.

62
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:18,389
Blast.

63
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,394
Buzz.

64
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,380
'Ooh, it's getting dark.'

65
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,416
Good thing I brought my evening jacket.

66
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,383
And since my little birdies cut phone and power

67
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:38,648
we won't have any interruptions

68
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,381
while we catch up, old chum.

69
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,396
- Heh! - Huh!

70
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,431
Now, where is Old Brucie?

71
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,394
Master Bruce is in the city

72
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:55,422
on very important business.

73
00:06:56,423 --> 00:07:00,400
Ya, runway for us, Bruce.

74
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,408
You see, bold colors project

75
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:03,422
such an aura of confidence for Mr. Wayne.

76
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:06,449
Wish I had a personal stylist.

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,423
Then while we await Brucie's return

78
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:15,441
you and I are gonna have some fun.

79
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:24,458
Ah-eee!

80
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:46,455
I must insist that you leave the premises at once.

81
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,492
Without settling scores with Wayne?

82
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,457
Nah!

83
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,491
Bulls-eye! I mean, bird's-eye.

84
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,487
But what has Master Bruce ever done to you?

85
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,479
Oh, nothing, nothing, really

86
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:12,514
except own everything that should rightfully belong to me!

87
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,485
I am from noble blood.

88
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,494
The Cobblepots were once the toast of society!

89
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:23,511
I am a Cobblepot!

90
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,494
Huh?

91
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,509
Eh, what's cooking?

92
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,517
Ooh, now we're talkin'.

93
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:45,525
The perfect crime... dinner and a burglary.

94
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,546
Oh, jeevesie.

95
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,553
Your roast is overcooked.

96
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:21,558
- What you got there, jeeves? - What? Nothing?

97
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:25,550
Giving Old Brucie a jingle, huh?

98
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:26,582
Good idea.

99
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:31,554
'Wayne industries contains over a dozen separate divisions'

100
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,551
including electronics, engineering

101
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:35,574
and biomedical research. And it's all cutting-edge.

102
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:39,594
'And it's all yours at the ripe old age of 26.'

103
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,576
Oh, would you excuse me for a moment?

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,604
Wayne.

105
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,573
'Guess who, Brucie!'

106
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:55,577
- Sheila. - Huh? No, it's Penguin.

107
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:59,584
Is this 555-43... Oh, of course I remember.

108
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,592
Bruce Wayne never forgets a pretty voice.

109
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:07,585
I'm home with jeeves and he wanted me to tell you

110
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,608
dinner's getting cold.

111
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:12,606
For you, sugar, I'd drop anything.

112
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,598
And no police, or the Butler gets it. Get it?

113
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:20,607
Beep.

114
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,621
That's a rap. I, uh, have a friend in need.

115
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:26,649
No problem. The camera loves drama.

116
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,639
Sorry, Mel. Where I'm going, cameras are strictly off-limits.

117
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:34,642
What now?

118
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,654
Dinner.

119
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:57,641
Top floor, ugly furniture, tacky artwork, bad Feng Shui.

120
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:01,684
Time to redecorate the bachelor pad.

121
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,671
Waah! Oh. Huh? Whazzat?

122
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,651
I say, it's the Batman.

123
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:14,661
What? How'd you find me this time?

124
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:16,668
It's what I do.

125
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:17,696
Grr..

126
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:24,674
Hello? Anyone home? Hello?

127
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:27,687
Your power's out.

128
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,726
Alfred, is that you?

129
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:06,712
Batman.

130
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,735
Go, before you get hurt.

131
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,757
Oh, dear.

132
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:28,749
Well, now, what have we here?

133
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,755
Don't harm us, Mr. Penguin.

134
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,763
Oh, you're that reporter from TV.

135
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,747
So where's Wayne?

136
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,765
I'm beginning to wonder myself.

137
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:50,764
Well, forget him! Penguin's your star now.

138
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:55,796
I'll give you an exclusive right over here.

139
00:12:57,783 --> 00:13:01,782
The true identity of the Batman.

140
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:09,790
Get ready for your close-up.

141
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,798
Mr. Freeze couldn't bring the heat.

142
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:26,785
Catwoman needed sharper claws.

143
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,790
'Not even that screw-loose Joker'

144
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,831
'could pull off what I'm about to.'

145
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:36,807
The cowl of the Bat.

146
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:42,806
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bac-key.

147
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,814
Ladies and gentlemen

148
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:49,848
I give you the man beneath the Bat.

149
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,839
Unbelievable.

150
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:01,835
That's for ruining my roast.

151
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,839
Huh!

152
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:07,868
Wha.. Oh, you'll pay for that, old man.

153
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:13,867
Heh heh heh heh.

154
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:21,875
Huh?

155
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,881
Arrghh!

156
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,876
Rematch.

157
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:34,866
Round two, then.

158
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,893
Make him a bat fillet.

159
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,889
The tape.

160
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:53,874
I've got it. Oopsy.

161
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:54,907
No!

162
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:58,886
Clumsy me.

163
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,914
Quick, load another one.

164
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,952
Heh heh heh heh. Huh?

165
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,944
I can't get a break here.

166
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,968
Hurry. We're missing everything.

167
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,983
You should learn to play nice, Penguin.

168
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,017
Why? I hate your guts.

169
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:43,008
Tweet-tweet. Fresh bat, my pretties.

170
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,033
We'll win the Pulitzer Prize for this.

171
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:04,029
I love the four seasons, Batman, especially fall!

172
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:08,030
Clink Ah!

173
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,022
Brawk!

174
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:14,034
Yaah!

175
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:17,059
Aah!

176
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:22,044
Unh!

177
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:30,070
You're all wet.

178
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:37,076
- Get it all? - I hope so. It's a dark night.

179
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:44,066
The dark knight. Now, that has a ring to it.

180
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:56,062
Mel? What are you.. What's going on here?

181
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,100
A long story. The Batman just..

182
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,071
What?

183
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:05,073
Funny how you and the Batman have never been

184
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:08,081
in the same place at the same time tonight.

185
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:11,068
Look, right there.

186
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:13,099
It's the, uh, dark knight.

187
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:47,110
Well, excitement's over.

188
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,116
Shall we finish that interview?

189
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,112
Thanks, Bruce, but I've decided to go with a different subject.

190
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:58,159
There seems to be more to Penguin than meets the eye.

191
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,164
Looks like I stole one thing from you after all, Brucie.

192
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,147
The spotlight.

193
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,172
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

194
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:32,175
Now, didn't I tell you?

195
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:38,157
Oh, I know, I know. Flirting with disaster.

196
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:42,183
You were right in more ways than you know.

197
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:50,212
I was... in a hurry.

198
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:20,225
