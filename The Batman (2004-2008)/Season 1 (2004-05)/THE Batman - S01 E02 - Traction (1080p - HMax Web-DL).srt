1
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,018
'Why are we meeting here?'

2
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:22,045
'Everyone knows he's attracted to shadows.'

3
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,048
Relax. The Batman thinks we split Gotham months ago.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,025
He dismantled my operation brick by brick.

5
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:32,019
Took down all my men single-handedly.

6
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:35,045
- I can't even sleep nights. - 'Batman.'

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,023
I know. He ruined me, too.

8
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:41,034
But you can kiss those worries goodbye.

9
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:45,043
I, uh, found the solution to our problem.

10
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:49,041
A mercenary volunteered for some physical enhancements

11
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:52,038
in a secret lab deep in the Amazon.

12
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:53,074
Wild, eh?

13
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:58,036
- Yeah. We got the money. - We're in.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,081
Gentlemen, meet Bane.

15
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:14,064
Eh... are you sure this guy can take down the Batman?

16
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,057
Just because he wears a mask

17
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,075
doesn't make him some kind of Superman.

18
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:22,099
There is much more to me than meets the eye.

19
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,159
♪ The Batman ♪

20
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:43,176
Neat!

21
00:02:58,182 --> 00:02:59,194
Master Bruce?

22
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:03,162
Master Bruce!

23
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:04,206
Oh!

24
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,196
Alfred!

25
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:11,207
Your nachos, sir.

26
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,174
Let's get that bandaged.

27
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:17,177
Merely a flesh wound.

28
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,185
I do believe my military medical training

29
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,217
has equipped me to deal with such injuries.

30
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,201
And that would be for..

31
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,201
Don't know yet, but it sure is cool.

32
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,197
If only the engineers at Wayne Industries

33
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:32,209
knew their cutting edge tech was being used to assist the Batman.

34
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,237
If only we could build a cleaning robot

35
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,220
to assist the Batman's butler.

36
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:55,240
Construction? This time of night?

37
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,252
Uhh!

38
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,269
Give a..

39
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,254
Uh!

40
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:25,267
The Batwave!

41
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,289
Bennett, we have an armored car assault

42
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:53,281
by an unknown masked assailant.

43
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:54,289
- Masked? - Hmm.

44
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:55,291
Maybe the Batman decided

45
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:58,298
being a vigilante didn't pay.

46
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,305
The money's still here. I've been baited.

47
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,318
'The Batman, I presume.'

48
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,344
The masked look must really be catching on.

49
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,323
Defeat me, and I will allow you to remove it.

50
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:28,313
Hate to disappoint, but I don't fight for sport.

51
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,327
Then fight for your life!

52
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,350
Yah-ah!

53
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:36,341
Uhh! Aah!

54
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:46,326
Talk to me. You can start with name and motive.

55
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,339
I am Bane.

56
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:50,361
The last opponent you will ever face.

57
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,376
Thud.

58
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,391
Lights out, Batman.

59
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,393
Go on, flee!

60
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,383
Thud.

61
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:29,411
Ahh!

62
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,409
Boom.

63
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,417
Yah!

64
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:57,434
Uhh!

65
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,437
Wah!

66
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,425
Uhh!

67
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,457
Take the money! Take it!

68
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,459
Crash.

69
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:23,451
Pocket change.

70
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,430
Crash.

71
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:30,457
With the Batman gone, all Gotham is mine.

72
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,481
Alfred.

73
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:04,506
Need pickup.

74
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:10,509
He's still here.

75
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,514
Check it out.

76
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:30,504
- What happened? - Big guy! Wears a mask!

77
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,509
- The Batman? - Bigger!

78
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,537
Threw the Batman through that wall!

79
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,509
Okay, if a dude were buff enough

80
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,654
to toss bats through bricks.

81
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,765
There's no way the Batman could have walked away from it.

82
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,540
So, where'd he go?

83
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:02,564
Plink.

84
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,569
'Dispatch, requesting all-points bulletin'

85
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,546
'on masked suspect in vicinity of Rogers and Engelhart.'

86
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,533
Be advised, perp is extremely dangerous.

87
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:14,539
And send units to all area hospitals.

88
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,552
We're looking for any new admissions

89
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,579
with multiple fractures.

90
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,558
If we find the patient, we find our Batman.

91
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:23,566
'Come on. Let's secure the scene.'

92
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,566
What do you say we have a look?

93
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,583
Could be license and registration

94
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,571
in the glove box.

95
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,605
Oh, dear.

96
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,588
Wait!

97
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:56,604
Uh! How'd it do that?

98
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:12,938
We're nearly to the hospital, sir.

99
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:13,636
Shan't be a moment.

100
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,611
Merely a flesh wound.

101
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:19,613
Oh, no, I may have been a field medic in the military

102
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,604
but I'm hardly capable of..

103
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:23,622
- Alfred.. - You have broken bones!

104
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:25,620
You may be bleeding internally!

105
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:28,618
You need serious medical attention, Master Bruce.

106
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:31,614
No... hospitals.

107
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:33,647
I'm afraid this is out of your hands, sir.

108
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:41,664
You see? We're already..

109
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,645
'Hey, what's this I hear about the cops'

110
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,658
combing the hospitals, looking for the Batman?

111
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,652
I thought this guy was supposed to solve our problems.

112
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:09,652
If I did not break all the Batman's bones

113
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,677
I guarantee you, I broke his spirit!

114
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,683
Oh. Being summoned to pick you up

115
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:28,710
has never been a good omen, Master Bruce.

116
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,737
Clack.

117
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,739
Someone's here for you, son.

118
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,722
Oh, Master Bruce, I am so very sorry.

119
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,729
I can never replace them..

120
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:17,749
But I promise you, I will never, ever leave your side.

121
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,746
<i>Please, Master Bruce..</i>

122
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,769
'Be strong.'

123
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,749
Uhh! Bane takes whatever he wants.

124
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,771
And never cleans up after himself.

125
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,752
- Here we go. - Detectives?

126
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:50,763
Have there been any breakthroughs?

127
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:53,751
Rest assured, we're doing everything we can.

128
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:54,762
What about the Batman?

129
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,769
It's rumored he hasn't been seen or heard from

130
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,775
since this Bane came on the scene.

131
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,771
We're operating under the assumption

132
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,799
that the Batman is no more.

133
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,770
There you have it.

134
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:07,784
Gotham PD seems no closer

135
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:09,779
to stopping this tremendous threat.

136
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:12,781
It's been three weeks since this crime spree began

137
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:15,793
and the juggernaut known as Bane remains at large.

138
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,801
Back to you, Jim.

139
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,795
The police can't handle Bane.

140
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:23,812
Neither, apparently, could the Batman.

141
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:26,809
Ahem!

142
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,793
Do try and rest, sir.

143
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:32,808
I've spread word you'll be on holiday

144
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:35,830
for some time, so no one should come bothering.

145
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,804
Alfred.

146
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,801
Gotham needs the Batman.

147
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,801
Sir, I don't want to speak out of turn

148
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,819
but if Gotham thinks the Batman is no more

149
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,813
perhaps it is for the best.

150
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:49,808
Perhaps Bruce Wayne can heal

151
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:51,849
and finally get on with his life.

152
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:05,857
Your favorite, sir, enchiladas mole.

153
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,845
And you are doing what?

154
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,855
What you suggested, Alfred.

155
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,843
Getting on with my life.

156
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,847
Interesting interpretation, but know that

157
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,858
if you intend to face this Bane again, sir

158
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,003
you may need to find another

159
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,886
butler slash physician slash getaway driver.

160
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,889
I understand, Alfred.

161
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,885
Oh, very well, then.

162
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:55,895
Let's get to work, shall we?

163
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,907
'All units, disturbance at 437 Adams.'

164
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,893
- 'Masked intruder on premises.' - This is Yin.

165
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,599
I'm in the neighborhood. I'll check it out.

166
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,899
Yin, Bennett. Thought we were off-duty.

167
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,943
- 'Bane didn't get that memo.' - Wait for my backup.

168
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,944
'Yin! Yin, do you copy?'

169
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:35,954
thud thud.

170
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,939
Gotham PD! Put your hands in the air!

171
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:48,970
Thud

172
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,957
crunches clacks.

173
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,978
Goodnight, detective.

174
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:19,965
Huh!

175
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:20,998
Thud.

176
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,971
You did survive.

177
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,980
'Master Bruce, how are things in the Batbot?'

178
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,999
'According to Batwave, all systems go.'

179
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,016
Ah!

180
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,037
Uhh!

181
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:08,046
Alright, stairs it is.

182
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:25,060
Aah! Uhh!

183
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,071
Uhh!

184
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,095
Yahh!

185
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,093
Crash

186
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:04,076
screech Yay!

187
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,078
Yin!

188
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,110
Need an ambulance, 437 Adams

189
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,081
and every available unit for backup.

190
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,112
The Batman!

191
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,100
Dispatch, cancel backup. Just the ambulance.

192
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,123
Uhh!

193
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,128
Thud.

194
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:34,134
Uhh!

195
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:40,141
You cannot... beat... Bane.

196
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,134
Zap.

197
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:59,123
I left you with some dignity last time

198
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:02,119
but now I will unmask you

199
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:05,154
'then break the rest of your bones.'

200
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,192
Whew!

201
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:46,174
'Alfred, need pickup.'

202
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:50,170
'Oh! Right away, sir.'

203
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,169
'Bane was found unconscious at the scene'

204
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:56,175
amid signs of a struggle, but who Bane struggled with

205
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,183
remains a mystery.

206
00:19:57,207 --> 00:19:59,176
Back to you, Jim.

207
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,194
So, the Batman returns.

208
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:05,184
Hard to tell, there was something..

209
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,193
Different about him.

210
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:09,196
You know, that doesn't change things.

211
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,219
I know.

212
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,206
Ow!

213
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,212
Will you be requiring the Batbot, sir?

214
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:25,235
I just need to watch those sudden moves.

215
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:29,249
Jolly good then, sir.

216
00:20:56,273 --> 00:21:00,267
