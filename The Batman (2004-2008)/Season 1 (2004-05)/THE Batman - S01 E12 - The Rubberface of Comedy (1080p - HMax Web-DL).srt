00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:33,017
Ha, ha, ha, ha! The circus is in town.

2
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,018
- Hey, you! - Stop!

3
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,055
Punch. Judy.

4
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,046
Ha, ha!

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,070
Ah!

6
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:05,044
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

7
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:06,089
I call it Joker-putty.

8
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,091
And I can turn anything into it.

9
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:13,073
Thud.

10
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:20,061
Ta-ta! Farewell! Mwahh! Mwahh!

11
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:22,068
'Hold it, Joker.'

12
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:24,098
Lower your weapon.

13
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,094
You the man.

14
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:40,107
He, ha, ha, ha!

15
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,125
Click.

16
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,114
Go!

17
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:51,133
Thud Ha ha ha ha!

18
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:59,139
Boing boing thud thud thud.

19
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,175
♪ The Batman ♪

20
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:09,184
'He made you look like clowns.'

21
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,171
thud Six months ago

22
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,181
Gotham had the lowest crime rate in the nation.

23
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:18,220
Yesterday we were declared the world's scariest city.

24
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,191
And that was before Joker's latest escapade.

25
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,203
But chief, most of the guys on that board

26
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:27,187
are in prison now or Arkham.

27
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:29,206
And who received credit for those busts?

28
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,208
You? Or you, Yin?

29
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:34,221
I know it wasn't you, Bennett.

30
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,214
So tell me, who?

31
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:38,211
Well, you know... Batman, I guess..

32
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:41,215
That's right. The Batman.

33
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,207
Well, I'm tired of clowns and vigilantes

34
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,223
turning my department into a laughing stock.

35
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:51,209
So say hello to my new zero-tolerance policy

36
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,236
against all these freaks.

37
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,233
No exceptions!

38
00:03:57,257 --> 00:04:00,225
And for starters, I want Gotham's finest

39
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:04,240
to take down Joker, before The Batman does.

40
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:07,232
<i>Capisce?</i>

41
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:10,236
Chief Rojas, I'm going out on a limb here

42
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,270
but I've been thinking.

43
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:16,238
Maybe we'd have more success

44
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,272
if we tried working with Bats.

45
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,245
Working with The Batman?

46
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,266
Maybe you could wear spandex and be the Bat's sidekick.

47
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,251
You'd better figure out where your loyalties lie, detective

48
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,293
and fast!

49
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,263
If Gotham belongs to Joker

50
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,276
the dull face of tragedy

51
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,301
must become the rubber face of comedy.

52
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:56,293
Joker putty, work your magic!

53
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,320
Hee hee hee hee!

54
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,296
Joker!

55
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,290
The Batman!

56
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,306
'Punch and Judy, my marionettes.'

57
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,301
Keep the Bat busy.

58
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:17,334
The artist must not be disturbed.

59
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:26,330
Clank

clank.

65
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,385
They're up there.

66
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:24,365
You take Joker. The Batman's mine.

67
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,377
Bennett, what're you trying to prove?

68
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,404
Bennett!

69
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:43,420
Pow pow.

70
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,434
Hold it, Bats.

71
00:06:56,438 --> 00:07:00,398
Detective, we're on the same side.

72
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,403
Tell it to the chief.

73
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:03,446
'Hold the mayo!'

74
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,447
I'm the vandal here.

75
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,427
You mean to tell me the chief of police

76
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:13,411
considers this vigilante a greater menace

77
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:16,418
than the clown prince of crime?

78
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:20,433
Why, that's an outrage! An insult!

79
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:23,457
In fact, detective, I resemble that remark.

80
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,458
Alley-oop!

81
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:39,467
They never give you enough rope.

82
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,458
Bon voyage!

83
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,490
Hee hee hee hee!

84
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,487
- Joker's getting away. - At least I got you.

85
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,494
Ah!

86
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:25,508
Take my hand.

87
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:33,492
- You alright, partner? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

88
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:34,528
The Batman!

89
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:41,532
Rojas is gonna eat me alive.

90
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,515
City champions that year, I believe.

91
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,525
I suppose in a way you both still are.

92
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,532
Alfred, how would you feel

93
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,522
about bringing Ethan into the fold?

94
00:08:56,546 --> 00:09:00,528
Allow someone besides myself to know the Batman's identity?

95
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:02,563
I'm certain Detective Bennett can be trusted.

96
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,536
Trust isn't the issue.

97
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,526
Ethan needs to know the truth.

98
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,560
Before circumstances force one of us to harm the other.

99
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:18,543
Joker remakes the largest monument in Gotham

100
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:22,560
in his own image, in effect telling us he owns this city!

101
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:26,559
And you let him and The Batman get away?

102
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,548
Chief Rojas, Bennett nearly had The Bat

103
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:30,567
but the scaffolding gave way and...

104
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,558
Yin, it's alright.

105
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,597
No, Bennett. I don't think it is alright.

106
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,560
One more blunder like tonight

107
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:39,582
and you can kiss your badge good-bye.

108
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:45,577
You gotta be under a lot of pressure to catch Joker.

109
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,581
Yeah, among others.

110
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:51,610
Well, Ethan, you're not the only crime fighter in Gotham.

111
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:55,618
I mean, uh, w-what about your partner?

112
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,591
Well, Yin? She's cool.

113
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:00,581
I mean, she's on top of things, good cop

114
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:02,581
my closest friend, probably, I mean

115
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,582
ha, besides you, of course.

116
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,604
I mean, we should all have coffee sometime.

117
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:09,589
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm Ellen's cup of tea.

118
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,593
Hey, don't let Yin scare you off.

119
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:13,621
She only has it out for The Batman.

120
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:16,616
Listen, Ethan, I..

121
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,640
- Just a second. - Uh, yeah. Me too.

122
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,616
- Bennett. - 'It's Yin.'

123
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,622
'We have a Joker sighting.'

124
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,607
The gallery theatricum on 23rd.

125
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,621
I'm across town, but on my way.

126
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,613
Hey, Bruce, gotta jet.

127
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,615
Hey, wasn't there something you wanted to tell me?

128
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,651
It'll keep.

129
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,654
It'll have to keep.

130
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,649
Ha ha hee ha!

131
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:06,651
Hmm. Ha Ha.

132
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:10,673
Such a winning solid gold smile, <i>mon frere.</i>

133
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:16,671
A shame about your ugly stepsister.

134
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:19,689
Turn that frown upside-down. Ha ha ha ha!

135
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:22,704
Whoops.

136
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,706
Yeah. Whoops.

137
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,667
I hope this means your chief finally figured out

138
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,677
I'm a greater menace than The Batman.

139
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:30,713
Oh, by the way, detective

140
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,688
have you met my colleagues Judy and Punch?

141
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:36,696
Pow.

142
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,705
This one's worthless now, and its partner's gone.

143
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:50,726
Not for long. I just tapped into Bennett's GPS unit.

144
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:55,722
Whoosh.

145
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:07,720
Sawdust.

146
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,745
'Flecked with blue?'

147
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:21,720
'All good things must come to an end.'

148
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,726
'Including my last batch'

149
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,747
of Joker putty.

150
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:28,744
'The chief has a zero-tolerance policy'

151
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:31,741
'just for creeps like you, Joker.'

152
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,736
He'll never pay ransom for me.

153
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,746
I don't need ransom, handsome.

154
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,738
Gotham is putty in my hands.

155
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:41,755
I take what I want when I want.

156
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,748
I'm simply out to prove to your beefy chiefy

157
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:47,790
once and for all that Joker is the master of menace

158
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,768
by breaking one of Gotham's finest.

159
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,771
I won't break your bones, detective.

160
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:55,790
I'm going to... snap your twig.

161
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:06,768
When Joker's through clowning with you..

162
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,786
You won't know where to find your mind!

163
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,798
'Ha ha ha ha.'

164
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:21,785
'Sir, is Detective Bennett our new ally?'

165
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:22,799
Not yet.

166
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:25,793
These blue specks..

167
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:28,828
'Traces of stale sugar on this sawdust.'

168
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,795
Cotton candy.

169
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:32,823
'Sir?'

170
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,825
A very thin line separates normality

171
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,849
'from insanity!'

172
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,844
<i>He made you look like clowns!</i>

173
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:06,826
Hee hee hee hee!

174
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,830
<i>Detective, we're on the same side.</i>

175
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:13,849
<i>And you can kiss your badge good-bye.</i>

176
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:16,854
<i>Life brings thousands of tiny torments</i>

177
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:20,883
<i>in all shapes, sizes, and flavors.</i>

178
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,849
Wouldn't you say, detective?

179
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,888
Chief..

180
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,879
Back off!

181
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,860
Bennett.

182
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,873
It's not my fault, chief. No..

183
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:37,872
Ah, so we have issues with the boss, eh?

184
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,878
Hee hee hee. Well, who doesn't?

185
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,874
Bosses make terrific tormentors.

186
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,878
Tote that barge! Lift that bale!

187
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:47,878
Rewrite that script! Sort that mail!

188
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:51,905
All it takes is one too many orders to make the cuckoo call.

189
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,885
<i>All it takes is one rotten day</i>

190
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:02,916
<i>to transform a normal man into a monster!</i>

191
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,913
Well, in my case, a rotten day and a chemical bath.

192
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,916
'So the giraffe turns to the police chief'

193
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,949
and says, "The last thing I saw"

194
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:28,916
"was that screw-loose detective

195
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,933
trying to pick the nuts out of the fruitcake."

196
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,922
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

197
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,943
Nuts out of the fruitcake.

198
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:46,927
Ah, detective, my therapy worked.

199
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,927
It seems you and I finally

200
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,966
share the same sense of humor.

201
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,936
'Don't fool yourself, Joker.'

202
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,964
Bennett plays for my team.

203
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:01,942
- Yin. - The Yin to his yang.

204
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,986
Drop it or laughing boy gets it!

205
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,987
You don't know what this stuff does to humans.

206
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,957
Clank For that matter, neither do I.

207
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,957
Let's find out.

208
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:18,989
No!

209
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:25,988
Now we'll never know.

210
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:35,994
Bennett, you alright?

211
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:39,010
Yeah. Go. Get Joker.

212
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,019
Aah!

213
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,014
Hee, hee, hee, hee! Ah, ha, ha, ha!

214
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:04,046
Ha, ha!

215
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,165
You think this is confusing?

216
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,055
Try living inside my head.

217
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,032
Through the looking glass, Batsy

218
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,038
where comedy is tragedy

219
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:37,065
down is up, black is white...

220
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:40,078
You're out of luck!

221
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,101
- Uh-oh. - Say cheese.

222
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:06,090
Thud.

223
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,094
The tragedy..

224
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:14,101
'Hold it.'

225
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:19,099
There's nowhere to go, Batman.

226
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:32,098
Go. You saved my partner's life.

227
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:35,112
This is the repayment of that debt. A one-time deal.

228
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:39,130
The next time we meet, Batman, the mask comes off.

229
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:54,141
Have a rotten day, detective.

230
00:18:57,152 --> 00:19:00,121
Kudos to my department for capturing Joker.

231
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:03,121
Without the Batman's help, I might add.

232
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:05,129
You gotta be kidding me.

233
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,140
We're playing cleanup, like always.

234
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,161
The Batman saved my butt tonight.

235
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:12,134
Chief, did The Batman catch Joker?

236
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:14,171
There will be no further comment. No comment.

237
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:18,144
Are you out of your mind, Bennett?

238
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,150
I suppose you let the Bat waltz out of here too.

239
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,142
Chief, it wasn't Bennett's fault. I...

240
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,146
I don't want to hear it, Yin. I warned you, Bennett.

241
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,158
You're suspended!

242
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:29,160
- Chief, you got it all... - It's alright, Yin.

243
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,193
I'm not so sure the badge suits me anymore.

244
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,188
Bennett.

245
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:55,178
Ethan, it's Bruce. You sound sick.

246
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,183
'Yeah. Rough night, Bruce.'

247
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,194
I-I may be... going through some changes.

248
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,459
Tell you all about it tomorrow.

249
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,224
- 'Over coffee?' - Nah.

250
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,765
'Let's shoot some hoops at the old gym.'

251
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,198
I need to blow off some steam.

252
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:12,202
Hey, what was it you wanted to tell me today?

253
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:15,194
Tomorrow. Over hoops.

254
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:16,227
Deal.

255
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,282
