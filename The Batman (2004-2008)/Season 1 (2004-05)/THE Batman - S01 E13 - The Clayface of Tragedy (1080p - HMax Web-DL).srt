1
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:07,986
<i>Previously on "The Batman.."</i>

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,999
Ha ha ha ha! I call it Joker-putty.

3
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:14,001
And I can turn anything into it.

4
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,994
Don't let Yin scare you off.

5
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:17,997
She only has it out for The Batman.

6
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:19,010
One more blunder like tonight

7
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:21,043
and you can kiss your badge good-bye.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,017
When Joker's through clowning with you..

9
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,024
You won't know where to find your mind!

10
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,029
Drop it!

11
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:33,014
You saved my partner's life.

12
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:34,030
This is the repayment of that debt.

13
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:37,035
The next time we meet, Batman, the mask comes off.

14
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,035
The Batman saved my butt tonight!

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,056
You're suspended.

16
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,110
♪ The Batman ♪

17
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:04,134
No!

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,145
Thud.

20
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,116
Work! It's gotta work!

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,120
Can't.

22
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:17,154
No!

00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:21,120

Help me!

28
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,138
No. Stay away.

29
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,148
Freeze!

30
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,170
Back away from the woman.

31
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,186
Sergeant!

32
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,145
What's he sayin'?

33
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,187
Who cares? Stay back!

34
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:51,190
Ooh!

35
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:55,160
- What is it? - I don't know.

36
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:57,175
But maybe we can stun it.

37
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,172
Aah!

38
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,194
Whoa! Unh.

39
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:09,189
Hey!

40
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:12,199
Ohh!

41
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,216
Officer down! Repeat, officer down!

42
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:21,181
It'll take time for Ethan to recover

43
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:22,286
from his trauma with Joker.

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:23,225
No doubt.

45
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,183
Now you really should think

46
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:26,448
about turning in, Master Bruce.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,227
It's been a long night.

48
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:33,233
'The Batwave.'

49
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:38,214
'We're under attack from some kind of clay-faced creature.'

50
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:41,205
- 'We need backup!' - Clay-faced?

51
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,234
Could be the night's just getting started.

52
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:50,219
Get away from me!

53
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:52,213
Come on! Hurry!

54
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,222
Come on! Move!

55
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,232
No!

56
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,249
Get clear!

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,259
No! Stop!

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,233
Help!

59
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:05,230
Please!

60
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:07,229
Cut the water!

61
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:08,245
I think we did it.

62
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,267
'We beat the thing.'

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,253
Do we know what that Clayface was?

64
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:33,263
What about The Batman?

65
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,262
Settle down. I'll make a brief statement.

66
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,276
First of all, I'd like to once again congratulate.

67
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,265
Detective Ellen Yin

68
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,269
'for arresting Joker late last night.'

69
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:46,275
Next, credit is due to Sergeant Beechan here

70
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,274
for taking down this Clayface freak just an hour ago.

71
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,286
'Now, while it may seem that Gotham PD's'

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,278
'had a recent run of good fortune..'

73
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,287
our latest successes are no accident

74
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,284
but part of my new zero-tolerance policy

75
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:02,288
against all freaks.

76
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,310
Including the Dark Knight?

77
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,300
I mean, The Batman?

78
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,306
Especially The Batman.

79
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,300
I guarantee you, we will unmask him.

80
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:15,324
- Chief! - Where is Clayface?

81
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,323
Zero tolerance for freaks.

82
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:36,358
No, against freaks.

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,349
No, that's not it.

84
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:45,346
On freaks?

85
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,361
Ooh.

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
Huh?

87
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,346
Batman! Move!

88
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,378
Sorry, fella. Clay not spoken here.

89
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:26,375
Chief? What... Clayface... attacked me

90
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,381
a-and The Batman..

91
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,380
The Batman's working with Clayface?

92
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:31,384
No! Yes! I-I don't know!

93
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,395
Just take 'em down, both of 'em!

94
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,402
With zero tolerance!

95
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,432
Alright, freeze!

96
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:25,436
Yin, it's me! It's me!

97
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,465
I'm warning you, don't move.

98
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:32,474
No!

99
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,487
I want Rojas under 24-hour guard.

100
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:57,468
And what manner of mucky-muck would this be, Master Bruce?

101
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,467
'Organic matter.'

102
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:02,467
Mutated human DNA.

103
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:06,491
Which means Clayface may be more victim than criminal.

104
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,509
I'll need to run some tests.

105
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:13,514
Huh?

106
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,536
Yes!

107
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,546
My voi-voice.

108
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,563
'Bennett?'

109
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,552
Bennett!

110
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,543
Bennett, are you in there?

111
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,541
'Yeah. Just a minute.'

112
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,555
Why haven't you been answering your cell?

113
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,578
Open the door.

114
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:29,547
You okay? You sound horrible.

115
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:30,557
Throat's a little raw.

116
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,556
You know, from all the screaming last night.

117
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,565
What's up, Yin?

118
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,573
Just wanted to make sure you were alright.

119
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,559
You know, this Clayface thing

120
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,571
was first spotted in your neighborhood.

121
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,563
So, what do I care? Rojas suspended me.

122
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:45,563
His "Freaks" are his problem.

123
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:48,582
Take it easy, Bennett. We'll get you back in action.

124
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:51,574
- Whoa. - Um... I..

125
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:52,584
Just got out of the shower.

126
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,576
Look, Yin, I'm beat.

127
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,598
I need a break from everything.

128
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:12,597
Lab samples don't just get up and walk away.

129
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:14,600
You're quite sure?

130
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:16,627
Not without leaving a trail.

131
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,635
Alfred!

132
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,659
Are you alright?

133
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,623
Fit as a fiddle, sir.

134
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,652
Nasty puddle of putty, wouldn't you say?

135
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,639
- Putty. - Sir?

136
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,639
Joker's putty formula.

137
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,641
What if Ethan was infected?

138
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,651
Clayface was first seen in Ethan's neighborhood

139
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:55,678
and Ethan's been at odds with Chief Rojas.

140
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,648
Ethan..

141
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,683
Is Clayface.

142
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,699
Go right ahead, detective.

143
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:23,705
What is it, Yin?

144
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,670
Chief, I've just come from Detective Bennett's place

145
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:29,671
and, well, something's not right with him.

146
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,694
I knew it. I never trusted that guy.

147
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:38,679
Bennett never knew how to play ball.

148
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:41,718
No... I guess he didn't.

149
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,713
But he's learning.

150
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,745
'Sir, it seems you have a phone call from Detective Yin.'

151
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,710
'Rest assured the lady is phoning for Master Bruce.'

152
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:07,743
Patch her through.

153
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:10,727
'Hello. Mr. Wayne?'

154
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,755
'Please, detective. Bruce.'

155
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,729
'Look, uh, Wayne, um, you and Bennett..'

156
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,732
Ethan are best friends, right?

157
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,732
Well, since high school. Why?

158
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,733
Well, he's had a rough couple of days.

159
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:25,767
I was hoping you could talk to him.

160
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,740
We were supposed to shoot hoops today

161
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:28,745
at the old east Gotham gym

162
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,747
but I haven't been able to reach him.

163
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:32,745
Is something wrong?

164
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:35,762
'Ethan just... hasn't been himself.'

165
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:40,775
You don't know what this stuff does to humans.

166
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:44,755
Whoa.

167
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,760
Because Ethan's not himself.

168
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:49,757
- 'I'm sorry, detective?' - Uh-uh, nothing.

169
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,781
Look, I'm sorry I bothered you, Wayne. I have to go.

170
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,782
So do I, detective.

171
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,815
Detective, how'd you get back out?

172
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,778
Excuse me?

173
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,779
You... just went inside.

174
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:18,796
What?

175
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,806
Wait here.

176
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:23,824
Chief!

177
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,819
Hey, sarge, who's that?

178
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:41,844
Never seen him. You there, stop!

179
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:46,848
What in the...?

180
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:18,852
Ethan.

181
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:19,881
'Attention, all units.'

182
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,839
'Clayface has abducted'

183
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:22,847
'Police Chief Rojas.'

184
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,852
'Suspect should be considered dangerous.'

185
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,861
'Last seen heading towards East Gotham.'

186
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:28,866
East Gotham.

187
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,892
<i>Let's shoot some hoops at the old gym.</i>

188
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,881
Wayne said they were going to the East Gotham gym.

189
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,913
Come on in, Batman.

190
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,884
It's time to say our good-byes to Chief Rojas.

191
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:59,880
- Let him go. - What, you don't approve, Bats?

192
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,896
After all, to Rojas here, we're both

193
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,892
on the wrong side of the law.

194
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,902
It doesn't matter what he thinks.

195
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,893
It's the code you live by that matters.

196
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,908
'And you don't want to cross a line you can't uncross.'

197
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,904
Maybe you haven't noticed, Bats

198
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:16,927
but my line's been crossed for good.

199
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,922
Ethan, no!

200
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,927
It's not cool to reveal secret identities, Yin.

201
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:31,934
Not that it matters..

202
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,920
When I can be anyone I choose.

203
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:39,919
And when I'm no longer sure what I am..

204
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:40,958
Except a freak!

205
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:46,936
Do you know what separates the freaks from the normals?

206
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,947
'Just one rotten day.'

207
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,970
Ever had a really rotten day, Batman?

208
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,937
Thought so.

209
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,940
Joker's rotten to the core, by choice.

210
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:00,959
A choice that's still yours to make, detective.

211
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:04,946
Turn yourself in, Ethan. We can help you.

212
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,959
You don't get it, do you?

213
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:09,953
Joker didn't just melt my skin.

214
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,983
He melted my mind.

215
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,976
I'm a freak inside and out.

216
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,973
And Chief Rojas has zero tolerance

217
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,985
for the likes of me.

218
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,990
Ethan, no!

219
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:13,013
Nice try, Bats.

220
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:16,019
But the water pressure in this dump always did stink.

221
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:18,042
Ethan, stop!

222
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,032
Boys' locker room, Yin.

223
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,028
You could get expelled for this.

224
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:25,028
There's no blood on your hands yet.

225
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:28,052
Please, Ethan, don't cross the line.

226
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:43,058
You defending The Batman?

227
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,084
I never thought I'd see the day.

228
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,081
Yin..

229
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,081
What's become of us?

230
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:10,096
Ethan!

231
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:27,109
<i>The next time we meet, Batman, the mask comes off.</i>

232
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,125
I made you a promise last night, Batman

233
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:51,114
but I decided against it.

234
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,115
Didn't even peek.

235
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,123
No cuffs. No backup.

236
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,119
I'm not sure I understand.

237
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:59,126
All I've seen the last few months

238
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,120
the last 2 nights, has challenged

239
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,142
everything I ever believed in.

240
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,137
It all comes down to one thing..

241
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:10,146
Ethan. He was right.

242
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,174
'Gotham needs The Batman.'

243
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,163
You could lose your badge for thinking that way.

244
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,170
If you ever need me..

245
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,173
'When Ethan suggested we have coffee'

246
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:45,176
I never dreamed it would be without him.

247
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,197
- I miss him. - You'll find him.

248
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:50,181
And then?

249
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,213
We'll find a way to help him.

250
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:57,185
I suppose they'll try and saddle you with a new partner.

251
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,184
I hope not.

252
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,197
I think..

253
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,214
Maybe I already have one.

254
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,225
I'm sure whoever you have in mind, Ethan would approve.

255
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,242
He could be anywhere.

256
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:35,236
He could be anyone.

257
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:08,276
