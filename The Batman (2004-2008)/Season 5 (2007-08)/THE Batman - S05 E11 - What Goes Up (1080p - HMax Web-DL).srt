1
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:21,003
Pliers.

2
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:22,034
Grunt.

3
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:29,009
Struggling only makes it worse.

4
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,041
Ball-peen.

5
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:36,027
We waste more time trying to get that thing off his head.

6
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,016
Don't tell me you're not curious to see

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,018
the face behind Black Mask.

8
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,029
'Sorry to disappoint you'

9
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:44,024
but I won't be here for my unveiling.

10
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:46,037
Another breakout attempt?

11
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:49,072
- We've seen them all. - This one you won't see.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,066
Aah!

13
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:41,117
Always hire the best, I say.

14
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,107
You ain't seen nothing yet.

15
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,232
And they call you a creature of the shadows.

16
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:59,225
A talent like that can be used for more than just a breakout.

17
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,236
Word from the prison grapevine

18
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,228
is that Black Mask is planning something big.

19
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:05,235
Black Mask always thinks big.

20
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:06,244
Where do you think he'll strike?

21
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:10,251
With this guy? Almost anywhere he wants.

22
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:18,244
And this rare meteorite is the only known object

23
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:21,279
ever to impact the Earth from the Thanagar Star System.

24
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:25,259
This now concludes our tour.

25
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:27,277
'Please exit through this door.'

26
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,308
- I see the guy's shadow. - But where's the guy?

27
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,305
Drop the rock.

28
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:08,330
You told me you could do this without setting off alarms.

29
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,297
An unexpected glitch.

30
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:13,302
The unexpected I always expect.

31
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,325
You two, get the rock.

32
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:19,329
Three-minute police response time, Number One.

33
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,339
Our response time is better.

34
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,327
Something from the gift shop?

35
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,359
Now this, I expected.

36
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,386
Doesn't even tickle.

37
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,418
- I got him. - Robin, wait.

38
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,402
Okay, bad idea.

39
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:30,408
No more dark nights for you, Dark Knight.

40
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,389
Hawkman, what are you doing here?

41
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:42,399
I'm here to take you in, Shadow Thief.

42
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:46,411
- Get rid of him. - With pleasure.

43
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,422
Ah!

44
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,434
You got lucky.

45
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,446
Crash.

46
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:31,466
Step on it.

47
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,468
Don't suppose he'll just pull over and give up?

48
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,499
I'll fire a grappling hook and reel him in.

49
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,511
Huh?

50
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:30,516
- Ejection seats? - Bad option.

51
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:33,520
Brace for impact.

52
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,515
- That wasn't so bad. - We never hit.

53
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,521
Huh?

54
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:52,514
Nice catch.

55
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:53,522
Couldn't let a fine vehicle

56
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,542
like this get scratched.

57
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,528
I'm impressed.

58
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,529
Your setup here is not that much different

59
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:07,542
from police headquarters back on Thanagar.

60
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,568
More Earthbound, of course.

61
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,576
That's him. That's Shadow Thief.

62
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,555
His real name is Carl Sands.

63
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,547
You mean he's human?

64
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,551
Except for a missing conscience.

65
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,551
He thinks nothing of putting others in danger.

66
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,553
Of all the criminals I've fought on two planets

67
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:29,552
he's the most reckless and elusive.

68
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,567
It's this wrist device that gives him

69
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,594
his two dimensional abilities.

70
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,562
He can make his body solid at any time

71
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,579
'and that's the time he can be caught.'

72
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:40,571
It's done.

73
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,580
I hope you're not gonna say dinner is served.

74
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,588
It's a piece from the meteor they stole.

75
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,581
The radian analyzer shows one element unknown to Earth

76
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:54,586
with antigravity properties I've never seen before.

77
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,588
I have. It's called the Nth element.

78
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,577
It's part of my suit.

79
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:02,604
It's what gives me my strength and flying powers.

80
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:06,584
It's incredibly potent and unstable.

81
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:10,614
If this is what they're after, all of Gotham is in jeopardy.

82
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,622
If this stuff works like you say

83
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:28,611
then the gem depository is ours for the taking.

84
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:31,654
But it's practically a fort. Nobody's ever broken in.

85
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,834
You sound worried, Number One.

86
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,643
Let me demonstrate how I'll do it.

87
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,625
You see this sample of antigravity powder?

88
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,628
It's been chemically treated.

89
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,660
Once it makes contact with the air..

90
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,642
It activates.

91
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,660
Aah!

92
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm taking the gem depository building, alright.

93
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,684
Right out of the ground.

94
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,649
Are you worried anymore, Number One?

95
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,653
No. No, Black Mask.

96
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:08,646
No, I'm not.

97
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,682
You should be.

98
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,670
Aah!

99
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,682
You.

100
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:18,684
You're my new Number One.

101
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:21,676
I think that honor is due me.

102
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,674
Hiring you put another costumed cop on my tail.

103
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:29,669
This caper was difficult enough without your fly boy around.

104
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,688
Don't worry, I have a little diversion in mind

105
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,716
that'll keep him and the bat quite busy.

106
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:46,686
'An anonymous tip on Shadow Thief.'

107
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,705
Tell me this isn't a trap.

108
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,697
Maybe not.

109
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:50,730
'Got anything?'

110
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:58,724
I see him.

111
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:28,731
The train.

112
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:29,738
That's right, Hawkman.

113
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,759
Next stop, the moon.

114
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,759
He used the Nth element.

115
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:54,797
How far up will it go?

116
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:56,788
It'll never stop.

117
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,829
Thwip.

118
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,849
The element's in place.

119
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:22,882
Get ready.

120
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:12,911
We're losing it.

121
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:14,923
Hold on.

122
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:34,256
Can someone tell me what Shadow Thief thought he was doing?

123
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,946
Keeping us away from the real crime.

124
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,919
Huh?

125
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,954
Anyone need a lift?

126
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,937
Batman, thank heavens.

127
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,954
Black Mask and his gang are emptying the vault.

128
00:15:57,978 --> 00:16:01,962
You better get them out of here. We'll take care of Black Mask.

129
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:06,988
I hope you guys haven't just eaten.

130
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,994
It's payday, boys.

131
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:24,992
You still owe the state ten years, Mask.

132
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:26,989
Huh? Mm.

133
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,011
Time to fly, bird boy.

134
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,014
Uh.. Aah!

135
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:40,016
Don't wanna leave you out, Batman.

136
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:45,983
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

137
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,008
Where's a blimp when you need one?

138
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:52,996
You wouldn't like the ozone, son.

139
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,023
Trust me.

140
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,012
Aah!

141
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:00,028
Thanks. Gotta get back to Batman.

142
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,043
Going somewhere?

143
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,079
I thought bats liked to fly.

144
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:45,074
Nothing will save you now, Batman.

145
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,075
Aah! No!

146
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:18,111
Huh?

147
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:26,099
Nice job.

148
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:28,109
Back on top.

149
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:08,159
It's gonna drop.

150
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:30,191
Whoa!

151
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:05,206
You get the feeling this is gonna make the local news?

152
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:12,191
'This was the scene today'

153
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,199
'as Hawkman took custody of the Shadow Thief'

154
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:16,211
for a flight back to Midway City.

155
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:19,215
In a related story, scuba divers have finally recovered

156
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:22,207
the last of the jewels from the gem depository

157
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,205
after Black Mask's daring robbery.

158
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:26,751
And though the city has lost a building

159
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,247
'it seems to have gained a new water attraction.'

160
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,228
Where are you going?

161
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:38,248
To get my bathing suit.
