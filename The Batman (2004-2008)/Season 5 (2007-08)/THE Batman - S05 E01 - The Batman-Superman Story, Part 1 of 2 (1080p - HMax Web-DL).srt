1
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:09,004
'Ladies and gentlemen, as your new mayor'

2
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:11,993
'it's a great honor to come before you today'

3
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:15,007
in this celebration of courage and survival.

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,013
'One year ago, we faced an alien invasion'

5
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:20,014
'that almost spelled the end of the human race.'

6
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:22,018
'Of all the cities that were attacked'

7
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:25,019
'our fair Gotham was the first on the battle lines'

8
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:27,015
and the most severely damaged.

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,012
Since then, we have restored many of our buildings

10
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:32,024
though there is still hard work to be done.

11
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,027
To that end, the good people of Metropolis

12
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:39,022
our sister city, have raised funds to help us.

13
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:42,037
'And at any moment, a check for those funds will be flown here'

14
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:46,024
'by the man of steel himself, Superman.'

15
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:47,036
Wait till they see him, Ms. Lane.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,044
The roof's going to come off the building!

17
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,035
Fanboy.

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,046
What're you, un-American? He's Superman.

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,044
Yeah? Well, we have our own hero.

20
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,047
The bat? He's okay, if you like the circus.

21
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:59,082
Superman's the real deal.

22
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,080
Yeah? If he's so super, why's he so late?

23
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:06,047
Clark? Where are you?

24
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,091
Uh, well, Lois, I... I got a little problem, I..

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,672
I left my press pass in my other pants

26
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,064
and they won't let me in.

27
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,060
Maybe if you came down to vouch for me..

28
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,058
I swear, Clark, it's a wonder you remember

29
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,067
to wear pants at all.

30
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,092
'Show's already started. Sorry.'

31
00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:29,084
The moment you've been waiting for has finally arrived.

32
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:32,081
Here he is, straight from Metropolis..

33
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,106
Superman!

34
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:51,119
- Whoa. - Told ya.

35
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,402
Mayor Hill, it is my great privilege to present this check

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
to the good people of Gotham City.

37
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,128
The check's been canceled, Superman.

38
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,144
And so have you!

39
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,165
This isn't in the program.

40
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,131
Rip Metallo!

41
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,154
In the flesh.

42
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,222
That's right, Perry. Metallo's back.

43
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,232
Stay on the line.

44
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:54,247
Crash.

45
00:03:55,253 --> 00:04:01,246
Come on!

46
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:13,271
You don't know how long I've waited!

47
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,277
Crash

48
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,277

49
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:29,290
What's say we take this somewhere more private?

50
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,280

Lookin' a little green, Supes.

54
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:54,287
Me? I love kryptonite. Can't get enough.

55
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:58,293
But I guess one man's power source is another man's poison.

56
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,320
Swoosh.

57
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,331
Haa-a-ah!

As long as I'm near Supes..

65
00:05:58,372 --> 00:05:59,377
'...he's finished.'

66
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:04,373
And I'm not moving another inch.

67
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:07,347
Suit yourself.

68
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,382

Do you see what I see?

74
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,424
Let's do it.

75
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:56,430
Clang clang.

76
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:02,414

Boom.

00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,431
Get that as far away from here as you can.

Uh.. No!

87
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,499
Whirr.

88
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,486
He isn't even scratched, just powered down.

89
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,486
An internal battery will keep him alive.

90
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,491
- Where's the kryptonite? - Don't worry. We got it.

91
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:23,481
I want it.

92
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,505
You're not very trusting.

93
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:32,494
Not when it comes to that... Mr. Wayne.

94
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:34,503
Hey, you two.

95
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:35,538
How about a handshake?

96
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,598
It'd make a great page one.

97
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,543
Click I'll get it to you within 24 hours.

98
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,502
- Where? - I'll find you.

99
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:45,540
Screech.

100
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:53,534
Whoa! Nice ride.

101
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,551
'What?'

102
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,552
clack.

103
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,545
After all that work to get Metallo powered up

104
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,537
he's stopped by a clown in a bat suit!

105
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,533
What happened to my kryptonite?

106
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:16,541
It's probably with Superman by now.

107
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,537
But we still have a few small pieces left

108
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,545
and some dust.

109
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,546
Barely enough to give him a headache.

110
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,554
There's no one left to challenge the Kryptonian anymore.

111
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:28,549
No allies have any strength or cunning.

112
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,569
Not here, not in Metropolis.

113
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:32,595
I'm on my own.

114
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:35,564
Unless..

115
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,566
Mercy, get my jet ready.

116
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,575
We're going to be spending some time

117
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,569
with our Gotham division.

118
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:43,591
That's where we'll find the answer to our problem.

119
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,576
Screech

120
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,584
I can't believe he peeked under your mask.

121
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,581
That is so not cool.

122
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,590
It's Superman's way of saying he knows

123
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,588
how to find me if he wants to.

124
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,597
I'd like to even that playing field.

125
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,624
Screech

126
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,621
whirr.

127
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,619
This is the new tech lab?

128
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,627
Kickin'.

129
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:41,650
Having fun?

130
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,650
A blast.

131
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,631
You've been busy, Lucius.

132
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:51,640
You said you wanted to be prepared

133
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,644
if there's another alien invasion.

134
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:55,677
These are just prototypes

135
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,658
but I'd say we're making headway.

136
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,644
Whoa. This has got to be for me.

137
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,655
It's a jetpack, right? Please tell me it's a jetpack!

138
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,662
- A jetpack and rocket launcher. - Yes!

139
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,666
I know you didn't come here for a tour.

140
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,663
- What's up? - I need this gift-wrapped.

141
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,683
- In lead. - Fascinating.

142
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,088
- What you lookin' at? - Metropolis.

143
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:33,677
- What're those? - Supersonic disturbances.

144
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,675
This particular satellite picks up objects

145
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:36,690
moving faster than sound.

146
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:38,690
'Usually, they indicate jet craft'

147
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:41,723
but in Metropolis, almost all of them come from Superman.

148
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,699
Here's his pattern for the last 48 hours.

149
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:46,697
He gets around.

150
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,706
'What's that place?'

151
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,706
- "The Daily Planet." - That's where Lois Lane works.

152
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,723
I heard he likes her, but not that much.

153
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,725
That's not the only place he frequents.

154
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:07,737
Ding.

155
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:14,731
- You sure you're okay? - I got it.

156
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:17,715
Uh, by the way, Lois, there's a cable special tonight

157
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,730
on the plight of the long-eared jerboa.

158
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,728
- I was wondering if... - Gee, Clark, I'd love to.

159
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:24,744
But, um I have to... uh-um, wash my hair.

160
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,749
Whoa!

161
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:42,770
Heh. And they call me a split personality.

162
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,749
Mr. Wayne.

163
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:49,759
You really are the world's greatest detective.

164
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:53,751
Here it is, like you asked. It's sealed in lead.

165
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,216
You can take a peek, if you want but.

166
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,772
I wouldn't advise opening it.

167
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,760
I'll take your word.

168
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,761
I didn't think you were the trusting kind.

169
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,764
By the way, the Justice League's about to have

170
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:03,774
its first official meeting.

171
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,766
I heard the Martian invited you, but you declined.

172
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,787
I prefer to work alone.

173
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,769
So did I, once.

174
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,807
But I found out you never know when you might need a friend.

175
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,836
Clack clack clack.

176
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,812
What're you doing here so late?

177
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:54,822
I could ask you the same thing.

178
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,832
Pretty young lady alone in the building.

179
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,821
I'm emailing Luthor.

180
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,818
We were supposed to have an interview tomorrow

181
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:01,834
but he left for Gotham a few days ago

182
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,839
so I wanted to see if he could reschedule.

183
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:06,841
That's funny. I heard you were going to Gotham, too.

184
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:09,837
Not me. I just got back last week.

185
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,869
No, I'm sure of it.

186
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,871
Thud.

187
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,863
Uh! Uh-uh!

188
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:39,902
Bang bang bang

189
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,884
whirr.

190
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,864
Greetings from Gotham, Ms. Lane.

191
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,907
You can call me Black Mask.

192
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,884
Whoo-hoo!

193
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,910
Swoosh.

194
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:08,891
Just call me Rocket robin.

195
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,933
Alright, rocket. Time to come down to Earth.

196
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:12,902
We've got a city to patrol.

197
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,900
But there's nothing happening down there.

198
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:17,895
Even you said it's been quieter than the batcave.

199
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,900
Hey, why don't I patrol from up here?

200
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:20,915
Got the whole sky to myself.

201
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,943
Swoosh.

202
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
Whoa!

203
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,908
I got an idea for the next prototype..

204
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:31,952
Barf bags.

205
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:37,943
Crash.

206
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,950
Ninety seconds. Not bad.

207
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:50,935
I don't think that's going to do you much good.

208
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,942
Oh, but this was made to order.

209
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,960
Zap.

210
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,943
Feeling strange, Superman?

211
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,958
That energy blast mimics radiation from a red sun.

212
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,983
Your powers have been temporarily cut.

213
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,995
Creak

214
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,994
roar

215
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:18,987
crash

216
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:23,001
swoosh whack Huh?

217
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,995
Oof!

218
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:30,992
Crash

219
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:41,020
whack Huh?

220
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,031
Whack.

221
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:58,019
Now, freeze, before he fully recovers.

222
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:11,011
He's too weak to melt his way out.

223
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,011
He'll suffocate for sure.

224
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,046
Oh!

225
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:22,049
Crack crack crack No!

226
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,067
- Uh! - Oh!

227
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:36,077
Alright. Round two.

228
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,047
No wonder it's been so quiet lately.

229
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:50,084
Here's where the party is.

230
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,088
Thud

231
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,094
splat

232
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,115
whoosh.

233
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,108
Hyah!

234
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,087
Whack thud thud Huh?

235
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,120
Pow crash.

236
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,133
Not so fast!

237
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:47,113
Huh?

238
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:48,145
Eww.

239
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:51,141
Sizzle.

240
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,112
You okay?

241
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:57,126
Nothing a hot shower won't fix.

242
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,132
And you?

243
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:01,130
Feeling no pain.

244
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:04,136
So, why the sudden interest in Superman, Black Mask?

245
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,143
Getting tired of me?

246
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:09,135
- He's working with Luthor. - Luthor?

247
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:10,146
They were talking on the phone.

248
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,131
Luthor has been here in Gotham since last week.

249
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,148
That would explain where he got this.

250
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:19,138
I think I should pay Luthor a visit.

251
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,162
Maybe we both... should.

252
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,158
He's not much for conversation, is he?

253
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:27,184
Like you should talk.

254
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,187
Crash

255
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,165
thud

256
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:40,202
I take it Ms. Lane is alive and well once again.

257
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,174
You've gone too far this time, Lex.

258
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:46,186
But I'm on your side, Superman.

259
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,198
In fact, I've been doing some criminal capturing myself.

260
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,215
Click.

261
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:05,182
Ms. Poison Ivy, a fiery little flower.

262
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,215
She had the silly notion she could defeat you with this.

263
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,205
Plant spores, the mind-controlling variety.

264
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,207
Of course, they would never work on you.

265
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,211
You're invulnerable to spores and germs and bacteria..

266
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:23,231
Unless they were laced with kryptonite dust.

267
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:27,207
That's right, Superman.

268
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:29,212
That was my contribution.

269
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,217
At first, I wanted you destroyed.

270
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:32,522
But then, when Ms. Ivy came to me

271
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,235
at the 11th hour with this..

272
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,234
I saw new possibilities.

273
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:42,222
Of course, I couldn't let her have all the fun.

274
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:44,258
I wanted to control you myself.

275
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:49,255
Look at me when I talk to you.

276
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,277
Bow to me.

277
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:59,279
I said bow, you alien swine!
