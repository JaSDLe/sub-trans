1
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,062
- Well, any ideas, guys? - Let's start with this.

2
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:15,098
Clang crash.

3
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,118
Kind of slow, aren't they?

4
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:23,102
They're still learning.

5
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,104
Let's go.

6
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,113
Still faster than Hawkman.

7
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,110
Hey!

8
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,095
I'll bet this was our ride in.

9
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,119
Now, it's our ride out.

10
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,126
Ugh! Oww!

11
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:56,138
That felt... different.

12
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,136
Thud.

13
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:05,132
We're out of here.

14
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,141
Boom.

15
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:19,134
You know how to fly this?

16
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:21,140
Wayne Tech has five of these from the invasion

17
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:23,140
the spoils of war.

18
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:25,150
Whoa!

19
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:33,168
Company's coming.

20
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:36,179
Vroom

21
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,175
clank.

22
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:46,149
We need a place to regroup where they can't find us.

23
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:47,163
Can't they trace this vehicle?

24
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:49,163
I've shut off all tracking devices.

25
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:52,163
But my android can still find us by reading our minds.

26
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,169
Not if we don't know where we're going.

27
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:56,190
Everyone, shut your eyes.

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,178
- No peeking. - What about you?

29
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:06,185
My cowl's lined with electronics.

30
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,191
The only thing he'll read is static.

31
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:27,193
You can look now, I've activated an electronic grid

32
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,213
to jam their mind-reading.

33
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:35,200
Zap.

34
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:39,227
- They're already here! - Batgirl, hold your fire.

35
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,218
You knew she was here?

36
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:43,219
I asked her to be on standby, just in case.

37
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:46,215
Okay, so, I guess this is where I ask

38
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,236
have I missed anything?

39
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:54,236
Whoa. Lots.

40
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:58,235
Even without their powers

41
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,227
the Justice League proved problematic.

42
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:04,223
Especially the one called Batman.

43
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,245
I told you he was the biggest threat.

44
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,271
We have to deal with them quickly.

45
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,241
You have to. I did my part, helping you steal their powers.

46
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:19,269
Now, do yours by giving me the knowledge of the Universe.

47
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:23,271
So be it.

48
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,292
Huh.

49
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,283
Thud

50
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,294
beep.

51
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,312
Magnificent.

52
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,284
Scour the city. Find the League.

53
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,325
'We cannot let them disrupt our mission.'

54
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,320
'As long as they remain alive, they are a danger.'

55
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:11,330
zap.

56
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,331
A kryptonite ray.

57
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,330
Boom.

58
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:24,306
This one fires yellow powder.

59
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,371
Well, what gives, partner?

60
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,311
You've prepared weapons to use against us.

61
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,317
Only as a precautionary measure.

62
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,325
Blame it on me, guys.

63
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,318
I went temporarily renegade

64
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,623
the last time we worked together.

65
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,319
This might have saved a lot of time and trouble.

66
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:40,362
- I can't even feel it. - Your android will.

67
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,338
I figure since they have your powers

68
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:45,337
they should have your weaknesses, too.

69
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,345
You better be ready to use those

70
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,342
'cause I don't think there's going to be any time

71
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,369
for target practice.

72
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,343
'And no one knows why the Justice League'

73
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,356
'is attacking Gotham.'

74
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,368
swoosh.

75
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,366
They've already covered half the city looking for us.

76
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,357
These comlinks will allow us to communicate anywhere in Gotham.

77
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,372
And these tracking devices can pick up

78
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:18,367
each of your powers' energy signatures.

79
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:19,376
Ready to jet!

80
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,360
Alright. Here's where we split up.

81
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:23,372
If we're gonna get back your powers

82
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:25,382
we have to capture each android intact.

83
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:28,370
We'll distract them while you attack.

84
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:31,395
You'll only get one shot, so make it count.

85
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:37,390
Vroom Can't this buggy go any faster?

86
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:40,409
I think they'll find us before we find them.

87
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,407
Screech

88
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:49,398
beep beep beep Looking for someone?

89
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,414
Click

90
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:08,437
pew Whoa!

91
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,427
Whoa-a-a-a!

92
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,428
Unh.

93
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,421
They're improving.

94
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:20,451
This will change the complexion.

95
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,450
Crash.

96
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,469
Okay. So, now how do we get our powers back?

97
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,438
You have no idea, do you?

98
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:38,476
I'm working on it.

99
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,473
Boom boom.

100
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,514
You're not gonna let me get away with that, are you?

101
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:01,499
Whoosh.

102
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:11,512
Droids. Not the sharpest tools in the shed.

103
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,516
Superman? We found someone we'd like you to meet.

104
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,502
As in, now!

105
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,516
Beep beep beep.

106
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,538
I got sunshine wrapped up. What about you?

107
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:45,531
- This one's gonna be tricky. - I'll calm him down.

108
00:08:57,547 --> 00:09:00,544
If that yellow washes off, he's back in business.

109
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:09,569
- I got him covered. - How's yours, Hawkman?

110
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,559
A little on the crispy side, but still in one piece.

111
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,580
Huh?

112
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,576
They're stronger than we think.

113
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,560
Where did he go?

114
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:28,549
He's got my invisible power.

115
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,567
You got so many, it's hard to keep track.

116
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,578
- Ugh! - Arrow!

117
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:46,596
Thud.

118
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,611
Sorry I have to use this.

119
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:56,575
Ahh!

120
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,618
Ah-h-h-h!

121
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,620
Clang.

122
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,620
Hu-ahh!

123
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:25,625
What?

124
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:36,623
Batman! I think the chest is a weak spot.

125
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:38,636
It breaks through to the energy source.

126
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,643
Bats! Give me a hand.

127
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:51,673
Crash.

128
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:56,644
And I'm back, Jack.

129
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,664
Everyone! The chest is their Achilles heel.

130
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,648
'Sorry, pal.'

131
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:07,679
boom.

132
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,696
Your secret's out.

133
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:41,706
You read my mind.

134
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:47,727
Thud.

135
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,735
Happy landings.

136
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,713
'Hey, robo-ripoff.'

137
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:11,731
Time to return what you borrowed.

138
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:15,756
Huh!

139
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,760
Now, we finish this.

140
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:34,763
Crash.

141
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,782
Looks like Hugo got his wish.

142
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:49,762
Absorbing all that knowledge has overloaded

143
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,753
his cerebral cortex.

144
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,767
If that's the shortcut to total knowledge

145
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,759
I'll stick with middle school.

146
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:58,758
We took care of The Joining and Strange took care of himself.

147
00:12:58,782 --> 00:12:59,785
Game over.

148
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:02,796
Not... over.

149
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:08,766
The superdroids were just the advance force.

150
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,799
The real invasion is about to begin.

151
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:23,794
The Joining invasion ship is on its way to Earth.

152
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,818
Looks like we're the greeting committee.

153
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,800
I'm patching into the League's satellite to monitor the fight.

154
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:36,823
- So, what do we do? - Make popcorn?

155
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:43,989
Think they've spotted us yet?

156
00:13:48,848 --> 00:13:50,839
I'd say yes.

157
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:55,817
Kryptonite and yellow energy!

158
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,816
They came prepared.

159
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:05,848
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.

160
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,840
There's too many. They're getting past.

161
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,865
Hey, where did Hawkman go?

162
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:25,846
It's gonna be a street fight.

163
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,853
- My turf. - What are you gonna do?

164
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:28,890
Just watch me, kid.

165
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:31,851
Come on!

166
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,894
Swoosh.

167
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,888
Fire when ready.

168
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,896
Boom.

169
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,891
That mothership is endless. The attack-bots never stop!

170
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,902
- I should get out there. - 'Wait.'

171
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,899
Strange was communicating with the Joining

172
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:13,900
through this system. It has to connect with the mothership.

173
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,897
If we had the right code we could shut down

174
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,907
the invasion from here.

175
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,941
Yeah, but who knows what the code could be?

176
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,911
He does.

177
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:25,904
You're right, if Strange has all the knowledge of the Universe

178
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,938
he knows how to defeat the Joining.

179
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:34,940
Thud

180
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,945
boom.

181
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:44,943
Batgirl.

182
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,937
I need you to set up the signal, now.

183
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,965
Me? But I'm still trying to figure out the remote on my TV.

184
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:02,984
Boom

185
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:05,987
crash.

186
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,996
Not so big and bad now.

187
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,994
Whirr

188
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,993
zap.

189
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,997
Uh-oh. Extreme makeover!

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,984
Hey. How come I know how to do this?

191
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,989
I'm in your mind, relaying instructions from Strange.

192
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:42,996
Whoa. We need to talk personal boundaries after this.

193
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,015
Boom.

194
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,028
Ahh!

195
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:16,037
Snap.

196
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,029
I'm sending you the last of the code.

197
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:31,058
My typing teacher should see me now.

198
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:40,080
Upload, now!

199
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,090
Thud

200
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:21,121
zap

201
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,122
boom boom boom.

202
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:45,124
'Clean-up on aisle one.'

203
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:11,132
- So much for the Joining. - Now, the melting.

204
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,142
No sign of any other ships in our star system.

205
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,134
Earth is safe again.

206
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:19,165
While Hugo Strange becomes Arkham's most peaceful patient.

207
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:24,143
Even with our powers

208
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,144
'we couldn't have done this without you.'

209
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:29,171
Well, some of us need powers and some of us don't.

210
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:34,158
Man, we've got the coolest clubhouse.

211
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,157
We?

212
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,194
Yeah. Junior Justice League, teen division.

213
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:42,187
Nice try.
