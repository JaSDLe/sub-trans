1
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, Grayson. How about a little game of b-ball?

2
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,034
Yeah, sure.

3
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:21,013
- What's that? - My ride.

4
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:25,011
What do you do, work in a funeral home?

5
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,677
I'll never fit in if the other kids see me

6
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,051
riding in a limousine. It isn't normal.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,021
You flit around the city every night

8
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:33,055
in tights and a cape. Is that normal?

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,034
I could have gotten home on my own.

10
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,023
'Not today, I'm afraid.'

11
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,024
'Remember, you and Master Bruce must attend'

12
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:41,021
'that charity party this evening.'

13
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,026
'I was hoping he'd be too busy.'

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,092
'Actually, he's in the Bat Cave at this very moment'

15
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,071
with one of those gents from the Justice Club.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,091
You mean League? Which one?

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,042
- The green one. - Martian Manhunter?

18
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,038
- 'No.' - Green Arrow?

19
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:58,039
- No, the other chap. - Green Lantern?

20
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,041
Oh, man, floor it.

21
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:01,071
Whoosh.

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,055
- Have you found anything yet? - No.

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,047
My system is scanning the visual galaxy and there's no sign

24
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:11,056
of any unusual energy signatures out there.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,060
- I wish we could be sure. - I <i>am sure.</i>

26
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,058
'The equipment is state-of-the-art.'

27
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:17,074
Maybe on Earth.

28
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,064
But we're not dealing with someone from Earth.

29
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:23,079
If only the watchtower sensors weren't offline for repairs.

30
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:26,071
Exactly who is this Sinestro?

31
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:28,075
He was a member of the Green Lantern Corps

32
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,081
'until he got power hungry and tried to wipe us out.'

33
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:32,089
We locked him away, but...

34
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:34,117
Sounds like it didn't take.

35
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,086
No.

36
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,083
Attention all Green Lanterns.

37
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:43,081
Sinestro of Korugar has escaped his stasis cell.

38
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:46,089
If you have any contact with him, notify..

39
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:48,102
Why do you think he's coming here?

40
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:51,095
Sinestro and I have a history.

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,112
Green lantern! You're really here.

42
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,105
I am such a fan.

43
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,115
- Dick. - Okay, I know.

44
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,116
People probably ask you this all the time..

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,116
Dick.

46
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,099
But like if you and Superman

47
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,121
were in a fight, which one would... 'Dick.'

48
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:06,121
Go get dressed.

49
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:08,133
Aww.

50
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,122
You know, I've gotta go, too.

51
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,127
I have to fly a plane home to Coast City.

52
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,119
Why are <i>you flying a plane?</i>

53
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:17,144
In my day job, I'm a test pilot.

54
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,137
Even your secret identity is cool.

55
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:23,122
Now!

56
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:24,143
Nice meeting you.

57
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,168
Nice kid.

58
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,141
I'll keep an eye out for your pal.

59
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:29,148
Thanks.

60
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:33,148
But, Bruce, if you see Sinestro coming, let me know.

61
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:35,139
Don't try to be a hero.

62
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,168
You'll be the first one I call.

63
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,163
Hmm, better dig out the lantern

64
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:56,178
and give this a charge before.. Uhh!

65
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,188
Surprise.

66
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,240
Hello, old friend.

67
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,243
I'm not your friend.

68
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,282
No, but you were my best student.

69
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,249
I even offered you a chance

70
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:24,246
to help me bring order to the universe.

71
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,288
But you defied me..

72
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,265
Rallied the other green lanterns

73
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,258
ruined everything.

74
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,270
Even so, you couldn't bring yourself to finish me off.

75
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:34,270
'You failed.'

76
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,264
Ugh!

77
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,271
Just as this planet's crude technology

78
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,262
failed to detect my arrival.

79
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,278
Now, give me your ring.

80
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:46,269
Why, tired of the one you've got?

81
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:47,277
Not at all.

82
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,279
However, with two rings and twice the power

83
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,280
I will destroy the Green Lantern Corps.

84
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,274
And then..

85
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:57,293
Well, you know the rest.

86
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:00,303
Yeah. I've heard it all before.

87
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:09,315
Ugh!

88
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:34,347
Thud Yaah!

89
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,367
Don't.

90
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,366
Haven't you forgotten something?

91
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:26,383
Find... Batman.

92
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,390
Safe with him.

93
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,411
'Come out, coward!'

94
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:41,384
My ring will find your ring.

95
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:43,411
You cannot hide.

96
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,420
- Having fun? - Tons.

97
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:09,425
And I just figured out why the Joker is such a nut job.

98
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,451
Because this much smiling drives you crazy.

99
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:20,447
That's it, girls. Just up ahead.

100
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,426
'Eh, careful, careful!'

101
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,438
Hmph. I tell you, the airlines these days.

102
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:32,438
Hmm. Bruce Wayne and his flock of fancy friends.

103
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:36,459
All that money just waiting to be taken!

104
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,440
What?

105
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:43,473
Huh?

106
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,488
Ahh.

107
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,464
Aah-aah-aah..

108
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:52,459
Aah! Stop!

109
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:53,496
Huh?

110
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:57,494
Well..

111
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,492
What have we here?

112
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,488
A perfect fit.

113
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,502
What the.. Aah, aah!

114
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,483
Okay, that's it.

115
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,491
Let me down!

116
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:22,521
Oof! Oh!

117
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,491
Hands up, Penguin!

118
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:30,525
Don't shoot!

119
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,525
Huh? Ahh.

120
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:42,531
Ohh! Aah!

121
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:47,532
Hmm. I could get used to this.

122
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:56,527
Oh, wouldn't you know it.

123
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:00,541
Another party where I wasn't invited.

124
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,547
Stop right there, Penguin.

125
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,559
What are you.. Mmph!

126
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:10,533
And now, as we say in the thievery biz

127
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:12,574
I'm gonna clean you out.

128
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:18,567
Eh... I said clean you out!

129
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:21,557
Huh?

130
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,571
Ah..

131
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:42,566
Guess I'd better be glowing.

132
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,564
Ha ha ha ha ha!

133
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,582
How did Penguin get Green Lantern's ring?

134
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:51,572
Still bored?

135
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:54,578
Don't worry, folks, it's gonna be okay.

136
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,584
Ah ha ha ha ha!

137
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,603
Ooh.

138
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:04,596
Hmph.

139
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,627
Alright, windbag, do your stuff.

140
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,626
Ahh..

141
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,633
Oh, what an artful thief.

142
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,641
What?

143
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm tired of playing with your toys, boys.

144
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:50,664
How about we try mine?

145
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:52,675
A boot?

146
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,662
Wish this came with instructions.

147
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,671
Ah, this'll do.

148
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:16,688
So how are we supposed to get that ring away from him?

149
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,686
'I found another one!'

150
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:27,709
You'll be okay, ma'am.

151
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:37,677
What in blazes is Batman doing?

152
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,681
'All units near Moldoff and Adams'

153
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,698
'respond to a 10-10 in progress.'

154
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,695
'Suspect identified as the Penguin.'

155
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:45,722
'He's using a super-powered weapon.'

156
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:26,734
All done? Good.

157
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,761
Now it's my turn!

158
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,750
Aah!

159
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:41,762
Ow!

160
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,761
You're supposed to have my ring.

161
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:53,751
I never got it.

162
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:54,787
Guys..

163
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:04,807
You know, mister, you could get a ticket driving like that.

164
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,791
And I'm here to give it to you.

165
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,786
What is the deal with this thing?

166
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,784
The deal is, you lack the will power and the intellect

167
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,808
to operate it properly.

168
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:29,788
Now give me the ring

169
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:31,802
or suffer the consequences.

170
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:35,807
Can I take a sec to think it over?

171
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:36,835
No.

172
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,865
Whoosh We gotta get Batman.

173
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:18,856
There he is.

174
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,845
That's one tough guy you work for.

175
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:22,876
Tell me about it.

176
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,887
Phew.

177
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:33,876
Aah! Aah!

178
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:42,889
Huh?

179
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,890
Uhh!

180
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,917
Oh.

181
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:09,899
Aah!

182
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:11,902
You put on quite a show, Oswald.

183
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,910
Shh! Can you keep it down?

184
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:16,901
There's an alien maniac out there looking for me.

185
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,941
Which is why I suggest you give me the ring

186
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,915
while you still have your fingers.

187
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,903
Yeah... never!

188
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:25,921
'Show yourself, parasite!'

189
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:28,935
Please take it, take it, take it, take it!

190
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,956
There!

191
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:48,959
Argh!

192
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,944
'Batman. Still in one piece?'

193
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:05,952
Yeah. Penguin's out cold.

194
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:06,988
Get the ring to me.

195
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:12,995
Here goes.

196
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,961
No!

197
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:23,967
It's okay. He can handle himself.

198
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:24,972
That's not the point.

199
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:25,982
I haven't charged the ring.

200
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,996
It's gonna run out of power.

201
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,978
Well, that isn't what I had in mind.

202
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:34,982
Uhh!

203
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,986
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

204
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,001
Nothing ever is.

205
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,011
Now we do this my way.

206
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:54,035
Ah, here you see the major flaw

207
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,014
in a Green Lantern Ring.

208
00:16:56,038 --> 00:17:00,033
They stop working at the most awkward times.

209
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,031
Ah!

210
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,058
- Get out of there! - Too late.

211
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,053
Ugh!

212
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:44,062
I want the power ring now!

213
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:47,089
In all the excitement, I seem to have lost track of it.

214
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,062
Apparently, your life means as little to you

215
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:52,080
as it does to me.

216
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:56,060
Now, where is it?

217
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:57,090
'Right here.'

218
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:02,066
Let's settle this.

219
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,105
With pleasure.

220
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:23,116
Uhh!

221
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:48,129
Need a hand?

222
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:51,131
Aargh!

223
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:55,113
I have had enough of your antics

224
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:57,122
you insignificant..

225
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,152
Huh?

226
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,136
I must admit, I underestimated you.

227
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,144
Really?

228
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:13,147
As a matter of fact, I think we're a lot alike.

229
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:14,176
You mean stubborn?

230
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,143
I was going to say we have enormous will power

231
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,145
but stubborn works, too.

232
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,154
Now, if you'll excuse me

233
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:23,185
I'd better take Sinestro back to his stasis cell.

234
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,163
Does he need a roommate?

235
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:27,161
I think we'll pass.

236
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,160
Nice working with you.

237
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,190
Likewise.

238
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:43,194
So how was it, using that ring?

239
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,193
Not my style.
