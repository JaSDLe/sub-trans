1
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,015
Don't let all this kiddie stuff fool you.

2
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,033
Toyman's not playing around. I learned that the hard way.

3
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,011
A psychiatrist could make a whole career out of this guy.

4
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,042
Just be careful.

5
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:36,037
Whirr

6
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,061
swish swish clang clang

7
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,059
whack crash

8
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:59,074
whack

9
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:09,069
zap boom

10
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:18,087
beep beep beep boom.

11
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:31,072
Superman, I've been expecting you and your masked friend, too.

12
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:33,085
Wanna play?

13
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,118
You're right about the psychiatrist.

14
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,084
Are you making fun of me?

15
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:41,099
That's not very nice.

16
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:45,113
Bark zap.

17
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,125
Hey! Who's been playing with my toys?

18
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,134
Huh?

19
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,146
Superman?

20
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:17,149
Superman.

21
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,213
'So, Central City fairground, huh?'

22
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,202
You sure you want in?

23
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,211
I mean, even I haven't been able to stop this guy.

24
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:42,213
Then maybe it's gonna take a little more than just speed.

25
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,219
Oh. You think you can do better, huh?

26
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,238
Fine, but don't get in my way.

27
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,247
Slowpoke.

28
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:56,240
How much trouble could some mirror guy be anyway?

29
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,227
What?

30
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,223
I just hate it when they bunch up in the back like this

31
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,255
don't you?

32
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:12,247
Hello, Flash. You found me. Congratulations.

33
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:15,237
You're Mirror Master, and this is a hall of mirrors.

34
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,251
Anyone with the IQ of a housefly could have found you.

35
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:20,238
That's what I was counting on.

36
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:28,270
Zap.

37
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,269
He's goin' from mirror to mirror.

38
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:35,268
He gets in through his reflection somehow.

39
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,265
There's no way to stop him.

40
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,297
Wanna bet?

41
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,298
Whoosh.

42
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:47,284
Take away his reflection, he's got no place to go.

43
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:50,273
Whoosh Do you hear somethin'?

44
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,297
What, you mean like a "thank you" maybe?

45
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,275
No. I mean..

46
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,302
This.

47
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,321
I don't know what kind of gas it is, but..

48
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:12,325
Flash..

49
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:20,318
And then he was gone.

50
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:23,305
I woke up about an hour later and..

51
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,323
You know, you don't seem surprised.

52
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:27,324
Almost the identical thing happened to Superman and me.

53
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,328
They got Superman, too? What's goin' on?

54
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:34,316
That's something I'd like to know as well.

55
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,319
Two of the Justice League's most powerful members

56
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:39,327
gone without a trace. How could that happen?

57
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:42,320
Wait a minute. You're not blaming us for this, are you?

58
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,340
'It's nobody's fault.'

59
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:47,329
Hawkman's missing, too, almost a week now.

60
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,341
So one by one, they're taking us.

61
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:50,372
Whoever they are.

62
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,347
But they didn't take Green Arrow or me.

63
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,339
And they sure had the opportunity.

64
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,347
We were both out cold.

65
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,372
- Yes, but... - But what?

66
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:03,355
Superman, Flash and Hawkman all have superpowers.

67
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,347
But you and Batman, well..

68
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:06,358
We're chopped liver.

69
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,358
- That's what you're saying, - No, but...

70
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,905
'Cause if you don't think we can hold our own with any of you...

71
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,351
We need to get back to Central City.

72
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,355
What for?

73
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,371
To see if we can dig up any other clues.

74
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,373
Yeah. We should. That's a great idea.

75
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:21,384
- I'll get my jet. - No need.

76
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:24,386
Zap.

77
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,473
Feel like a kid in the back seat of his parents' SUV.

78
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,410
Just don't ask me if we're there yet.

79
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,387
I don't sense anyone down there

80
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,384
but I'll scout it out just in case.

81
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,415
And we'll head over to the hall of mirrors.

82
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,433
Clatter.

83
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,425
It's a common sleeping gas

84
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,432
but the valves were activated by a radio signal.

85
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,449
Very sophisticated.

86
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,482
What are those things?

87
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,583
Don't know, but they're definitely gonna be a problem.

88
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:53,488
Aah! Aah!

89
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,483
Thud.

90
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,515
Arrow!

91
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:17,511
Crash

92
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,512
hiss.

93
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,524
Where are they?

94
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,527
Gone, both of 'em.

95
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,523
Too far.

96
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:43,532
Click click click

97
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,545
beep beep beep.

98
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,527
- 'Batman.' - Huh! Yeah.

99
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,526
- 'Got anything yet?' - 'No.'

100
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,522
It feels like I've been going over this remote relay for days.

101
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:02,534
'You have.'

102
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,530
There must be something wrong with me.

103
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,541
I-I can barely keep my eyes open.

104
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:10,530
This thing's not like anything I've ever seen before.

105
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:13,535
- 'How are you doin'?' - 'Goin' around in circles.'

106
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,550
You know, Superman and Flash might not have been our fault

107
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:19,538
but Lantern and the Martian, we should've seen that comin'.

108
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:22,559
Stop beating yourself up, Oliver. Mmm.

109
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,552
'They never had a problem with us being in the league.'

110
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,556
I was the one with the problem, always afraid

111
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,589
I wouldn't be able to keep up with 'em. Ever feel that way?

112
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:33,578
Bruce?

113
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,567
I know. I can be a real bore sometimes.

114
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,585
'Over and out.'

115
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:06,595
- It's going to be okay! I... - Hugo Strange. Hugo Strange.

116
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,606
Strange? What does he have to do with this?

117
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,629
- Hugo Strange. - What about him?

118
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:17,613
Bruce, are you okay?

119
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:20,606
What are you doing here? You're not in this.

120
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,610
Bruce.

121
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,602
- No, you're not.. - 'Bruce.'

122
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:27,623
- Huh! - Sorry. You were makin' noise.

123
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:32,617
I-I must've drifted off for a second. Whew.

124
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,612
What are you doin' up so late?

125
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,617
I couldn't sleep. I had a nightmare, too, sorta.

126
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,650
Kept hearin' the Martian's voice.

127
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:44,653
What?

128
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,631
He was trying to contact us. I'm sure of it.

129
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:49,643
Why didn't I hear him?

130
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,638
Because the mind is more receptive during sleep.

131
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:53,647
There are fewer distractions.

132
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,651
It's never bothered the Martian before.

133
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,656
Unless he's getting weaker.

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,653
But what does Hugo Strange have to do with this?

135
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:01,657
H-he's been locked up tight for months, hasn't he?

136
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:04,664
At this place, you never know.

137
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,687
Hello, Hugo.

138
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,691
Aren't you wondering why I'm here?

139
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:36,687
- Awful quiet, isn't he? - Usually you can't shut him up.

140
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,701
It's not him.

141
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,717
You're a lot heavier than Hugo, aren't you?

142
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,716
Crash

143
00:11:58,731 --> 00:11:59,736
boom

144
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:02,740
crash

145
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,765
clang

146
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:45,768
pew boom.

147
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,783
I got ya.

148
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,785
Zap.

149
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,783
Better stay back, I don't wanna take

150
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,765
any chances with this thing.

151
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,796
Don't. I need to see something.

152
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:15,786
Radio controlled like the gas canister

153
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,781
back at the hall of mirrors, except this one's

154
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:20,810
still receiving a signal we can trace.

155
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,787
What is it? I've never seen anything like this before.

156
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:26,825
Because it's alien.

157
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,818
The Joining's back.

158
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:34,805
You'd think after that last time.

159
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,799
The Joining would steer clear, eh, of earth.

160
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:39,798
Maybe they were just testing us before.

161
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,813
The Batmobile is triangulating the robot's signal.

162
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:44,838
'It should automatically pinpoint the exact location.'

163
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:47,815
- Got it. - Great.

164
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,813
Now if you could just figure out how to get

165
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,822
some legroom back here.

166
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,847
Vroom.

167
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,830
Air raid shelter?

168
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,839
It goes back a long time, to a war.

169
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:07,825
People were worried about air attacks.

170
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:08,841
Like they don't worry now?

171
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,833
No. Wait.

172
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:13,855
You may wanna save that for later.

173
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,877
- What is that? - Force field.

174
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,881
You never disappoint me, Batman.

175
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,872
I built this trap mostly for you.

176
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:49,875
That's how sure I was you'd find me.

177
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,914
- Great. - What was it, Batman?

178
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,878
My robot duplicate?

179
00:14:54,902 --> 00:14:58,879
Of course. I should have built an auto destruct switch.

180
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,888
But there's never enough time in the day, is there?

181
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:05,887
I told The Joining you were the cleverest of them all

182
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:08,895
but all they care about are the superpowered ones.

183
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,903
What made you go over to their side?

184
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:14,904
They have so much to offer someone like me.

185
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:18,919
Remember the first time The Joining came?

186
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,925
<i>Oh, it was bedlam..</i>

187
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,930
<i>Destruction everywhere.</i>

188
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,951
<i>I could hear it all from my room.</i>

189
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:45,925
<i>Arkham's brave attendants left me and my fellow inmates</i>

190
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,962
<i>to our own devices.</i>

191
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,948
<i>I was one of the lucky ones.</i>

192
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:56,936
<i>All I wanted to do was get away.</i>

193
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,954
<i>But then, fate intervened.</i>

194
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,978
Pew pew pew.

195
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,973
<i>I knew the alien vehicle would have</i>

196
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:22,991
<i>all sorts of fascinating technology.</i>

197
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:29,967
<i>I took as much of The Joining's equipment as I could.</i>

198
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:34,993
<i>Including their vehicle's central communicator.</i>

199
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:37,990
<i>Then I came to this place.</i>

200
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:41,990
<i>I combined their equipment to make a radio transmitter</i>

201
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,997
<i>that could contact them</i>

202
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:48,005
<i>and then I made them my offer.</i>

203
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:50,998
If they supplied me with their technology

204
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:54,011
I would neutralize The Justice League.

205
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:58,005
In return, The Joining would give me something

206
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,013
more valuable than even money or power..

207
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:06,044
The vast knowledge of the universe.

208
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:13,053
- Where are they? - Your friends? <i>Voila.</i>

209
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,057
Whirr.

210
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,053
My dream.

211
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:29,044
- What are you doing to them? - You'll see soon enough.

212
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:34,046
My, my, look what my associate found in your belt, Batman.

213
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,054
A mini explosive set to go off in 3 minutes.

214
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,082
I knew you were up to something.

215
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,055
You made it just a little too easy for me to catch you.

216
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,063
There had to be some sort of high tech surprise.

217
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:52,084
Actually, it's rather low tech.

218
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,096
Pfft

219
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,088
beep hiss.

220
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:06,095
Stop him!

221
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:12,100
Whack clang clang clang

222
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,108
whoosh

223
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,112
rizz rizz.

224
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,109
What do you think those tubes are for?

225
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,094
Don't know.

226
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,129
Then how 'bout we cut 'em loose?

227
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,121
Whoosh.

228
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:46,129
You okay?

229
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:50,109
Something doesn't feel right.

230
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,334
Well, you better get over it..

231
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:54,128
"Cause I have a feeling'

232
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:56,149
we're gonna be needing you.

233
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:20,150
Aah!

234
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:23,148
My powers, they're gone.

235
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,165
Uhh!

236
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:31,170
Zap.

237
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:38,199
The androids have taken our powers.

238
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,195
What do we do now?
