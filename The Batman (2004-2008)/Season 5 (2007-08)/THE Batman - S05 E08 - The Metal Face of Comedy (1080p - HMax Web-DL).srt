1
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,023
Whoosh.

2
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,018
So, this is what Captain Slash plans

3
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,033
to use to destroy the city.

4
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:32,048
Nightwing. You again?

5
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,048
Slash!

6
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:49,071
When will you learn you can't play at my level?

7
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,054
- Hyah, whoa! - Aah!

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,043
Man, Slash nailed me again.

9
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,064
- 'Nightwing?' - My Internet game character.

10
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:07,087
'Cool, huh?'

11
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:10,054
But not as cool as him.

12
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,071
I bet the real Slash is one totally awesome..

13
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:17,071
Dude, take your Nightwing and give it a rest.

14
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:21,070
'Slacker, are you playing video games?'

15
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,105
Well, uh..

16
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,082
'Or are you purposely not controlling'

17
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:27,069
these bank robbers in a box?

18
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:29,084
He had them working in rehearsal.

19
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:34,076
Ooh! Ah, hon, we can still rob the bank without them.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,091
I'm not in the mood now.

21
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,090
Mmm.

22
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:42,108
But I am in the mood to do something else.

23
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:51,109
Oh, pudding, give him a chance.

24
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,119
Martin's got lots of ideas.

25
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:58,108
Uh, yeah, dude, this one's totally cool.

26
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:01,106
A video game helmet I modified.

27
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,101
Video game?

28
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,105
Boys, dinner is served.

29
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,111
That lets you mentally download money out of a bank

30
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,108
into your own secret account.

31
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:13,111
Hmm? Mentally download money?

32
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:16,149
Now, there's a video game worth playing.

33
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,201
'I know I called you last minute'

34
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,189
'but I wanted you to be the first to see this.'

35
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:34,193
Bruce, we're not here to watch stupid dog tricks, are we?

36
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:37,210
No. Because that's not a dog.

37
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,227
'And it's not a trick.'

38
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,244
It's the latest in nanobot technology.

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,220
Whoosh.

40
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,210
'Not only have we been able to give each tiny robot'

41
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,211
'its own flight sustainable motor'

42
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:52,217
'but also the ability to magnetically bond together.'

43
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,217
'Their interdependent programming enabled them'

44
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,223
to form any solid shape.

45
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,236
And they can even self-replicate.

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,238
Gentlemen, you are witnessing a leap in technology

47
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:03,252
so great that..

48
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,230
Uh, I can't even finish talking about it.

49
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:10,251
Davis, take over.

50
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,247
Enjoy the afternoon nap, kiddies.

51
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:27,253
While those of us on the cutting edge of technology..

52
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:30,278
Explore new ways to rip you off.

53
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:37,267
<i>Let's see if this baby works.</i>

54
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,278
<i>Accessing account for withdrawal.</i>

55
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:42,273
Ha ha ha!

56
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:44,299
Ding.

57
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,289
Ha!

58
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:52,274
Transfering cash to secure account.

59
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:56,283
No keys, no vaults, no combinations.

60
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:58,297
Just mind over moolah!

61
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,323
Look, ma. No hands!

62
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,314
And no future.

63
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:10,333
Thud Hyah, ha!

64
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,322
Spoilsports.

65
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:22,336
Boom crash.

66
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:43,354
Captain Slash's lightning insignia?

67
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:49,341
Harley, what happened to your hair?

68
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:52,342
Why are you wasting breath on that crummy impostor

69
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,377
when the real McCoy is right here?

70
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,353
A digital Joker?

71
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:59,344
When this thing short-circuited

72
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,346
it must have transmitted a duplicate Joker into the system.

73
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,378
Hmm?

74
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,382
If that's true, then..

75
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:11,393
Try and cuff me now, Batsy. Ha ha ha!

76
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,365
I will. You're not leaving this computer.

77
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,379
Slacker! Slacker, download me, now!

78
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,392
Ha!

79
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,377
At least, we've still got the real Joker.

80
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:31,374
A digital Joker could be just as dangerous.

81
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:33,404
Let's get the original one to the hospital.

82
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,389
Dude, you've gone cyber.

83
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,394
How totally cool is that!

84
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:44,397
My idea of cool is not spending the rest of my life

85
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,428
as a <i>screen saver!</i>

86
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,388
You're making Marty feel bad.

87
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:51,391
He'll figure a way out. Right, Marty?

88
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:54,395
I've heard of something new in town that might help you

89
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,438
but we'll need a diversion to access it.

90
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:05,412
Hidey ho, Gotham! And welcome to HD Joker TV.

91
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:09,428
Let me ask you all, does this high-def make my hips look big?

92
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:12,425
He's broken into every major system.

93
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,440
This antivirus program should flush him out.

94
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,427
Nice try, Batsy, but that just tickles.

95
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,431
He must be transmitting himself from a system

96
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,452
I haven't accounted for.

97
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:32,431
Like maybe inside a game system.

98
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:33,462
Here. Let me.

99
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,438
Yeah. He's in the game.

100
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:41,458
Slacker, how long does it take to break into that lab?

101
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,474
Dude, I'm almost in.

102
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,479
WayneTech.

103
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:48,456
That's where he's going.

104
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,464
Joker's been diverting us from his real plan.

105
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:53,478
But he can't carry it out if he's deleted.

106
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:58,469
Nightwing?

107
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:01,460
You should pick better company, Captain.

108
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:02,501
Whoosh.

109
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,479
Slacker!

110
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:08,491
I'm in.

111
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:13,493
Zapping.

112
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,486
Huh? Ooh. Hmm. Yeah.

113
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,510
Ooh! I feel like a million bucks.

114
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:38,498
Thud thud Still behind glass!

115
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:42,503
Joker, you're not thinking outside the box.

116
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,527
Use your head.

117
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,533
Boom.

118
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,546
That was a no-brainer.

119
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,554
Huh?

120
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,563
Ooh, look who's arrived at my coming out party.

121
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,561
The party's over, Joker.

122
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:09,568
Oh, no, Batsy. It's just getting started.

123
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:15,544
I'm guessing the only thing worse than a digital Joker

124
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,560
is a nanobot Joker.

125
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,569
Medical report, stat!

126
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:39,576
Y-you had a bad accident. Y-you're a very sick man.

127
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,592
Flattery won't save you.

128
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,602
Consider me an outpatient.

129
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,588
Daddy's home.

130
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,585
Dude, it worked.

131
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:09,604
Hate to admit it but you finally did something right.

132
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:13,593
Sorry, boys, he's off the menu..

133
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:14,623
'...for now.'

134
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,603
Don't take it wrong, hon

135
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:20,615
but a boyfriend who's a collection of itty-bitty robots

136
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,601
is kind of weird.

137
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,609
I'll have you know I'm the greatest version of Joker

138
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:27,644
there's ever been.

139
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:30,617
Joker 2.0.

140
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:34,632
More like a bad joke, minus one.

141
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:37,624
Ah, I should have known I'd show up.

142
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:40,620
Pudding? Real pudding?

143
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:42,623
Tapioca.

144
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:43,642
I'm not <i>even going to ask</i>

145
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,667
since I'm sure this is one of your snafus.

146
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,649
Huh! Am I really that ruggedly handsome?

147
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:56,638
Peek-a-boo! Ha ha ha!

148
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,653
Ugh!

149
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:01,675
I can't stay mad at myself.

150
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,675
Let's work together.

151
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,678
Let's get this show on the road.

152
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:35,699
Huh? Aah! Unh!

153
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:39,679
Hey! Wait!

154
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,702
Open the gate, Slacker.

155
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,713
Deactivating main gate.

156
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,710
Whoosh.

157
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:54,733
Show-off!

158
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:01,744
'The gem depository.'

159
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,711
Gotta be Joker.

160
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,705
But which one?

161
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:06,745
Vroom.

162
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,716
Ugh! You gotta help me <i>brother.</i>

163
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,756
Gladly. I'll forward your mail to Gotham prison.

164
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,745
Attention, old Joker, version 1.0.

165
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,767
Whoosh Mission accomplished.

166
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,743
- But where's pudding, pudding? - Ugh!

167
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,743
Okay, kiddies, let's roll.

168
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:40,761
Hold it! Not without the <i>real real me.</i>

169
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,762
Ew! Creepy.

170
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:51,767
Dude, where'd you get the extra nanobots to do that?

171
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,762
I made them myself. Just one of my tricks.

172
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,761
No. Aah!

173
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:00,769
Zapping We have some too.

174
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,765
Aah!

175
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:05,795
That's it, Batsy. Give him the old shock and awe.

176
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:08,788
Poof.

177
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:10,798
Turncoat.

178
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,817
Lovely night for a drive. Hit the gas!

179
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,786
Vroom Excuse me, Batsy.

180
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,801
I have some unfinished business to attend to.

181
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,816
Beep vroom.

182
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,799
Ugh, uh.

183
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:32,801
Am I getting bigger or is the Batmobile getting smaller?

184
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:35,809
- This isn't the Batmobile. - Correctamundo!

185
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,831
It's the new nanobot Batmobile.

186
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,821
A compact version gets better gas mileage.

187
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,825
Don't you think?

188
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,842
Whoosh.

189
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:56,829
- What made it disintegrate? - An electromagnetic pulse.

190
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,827
It can temporarily deactivate the nanites.

191
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:01,841
Huh?

192
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,871
If Nano Joker can keep multiplying how do we stop him?

193
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,847
We stall until we can bring in something bigger to match him.

194
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:15,838
Alfred, I'm gonna need an item from the cave.

195
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:16,866
Vroom.

196
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,844
License, registration... Joker.

197
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,874
Huh? Ugh, uh!

198
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,862
Whoa. Cool fake-out.

199
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,865
Whose side are you on?

200
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,865
Sorry, pudding, but you gotta admit

201
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,860
pudding 2.0 really rocks.

202
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:41,864
Gotta go with the upgrade, dude.

203
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:44,907
This is going to hurt me more than it is... me.

204
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,910
Joker... put the Joker down.

205
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:58,906
You can't fool me twice, Batsy. I've given myself an upgrade.

206
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:04,923
Whoosh.

207
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,896
Let me give you the bigger picture.

208
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,912
With my self-replicating talents I'll tear Gotham down

209
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:18,912
and turn it into my own nanobot version.

210
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:20,916
Joker City!

211
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,913
The only thing it'll be missing..

212
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:24,941
Swoosh

213
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,950
is you.

214
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:46,951
Whoosh.

215
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:57,963
Aah!

216
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:04,943
Uh, huh?

217
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,957
When you send for bigger help, you mean it.

218
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,960
Good timing, Alfred. I'll take it from here.

219
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:11,970
Yo, big bully!

220
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:15,962
You didn't have to destroy my old pudding.

221
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,974
Never delete the master copy, dude.

222
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:22,971
On the contrary, if certain master copies don't keep in line

223
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:28,005
I may delete them too. <i>Do you hear me?</i>

224
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,013
Hear this.

225
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:38,011
Boom Ha ha! That's giving him a mouthful!

226
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:46,007
Batsy, you in there? Come out and play.

227
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:50,013
Okay. Let's play.

228
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:54,025
Zap Ugh!

229
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:11,036
Looks like I'm going to need some filler.

230
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,061
Aah!

231
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,064
Thud.

232
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,063
Shocking, isn't it?

233
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,054
Aah!

234
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:43,080
Yes, it is.

235
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:48,063
Oh, pudding.

236
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:50,056
Wait for us.

237
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,056
We're with you, uh, again.

238
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,096
I'll get better mileage without traitors!

239
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,100
Thud thud thud.

240
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:02,101
You're all traitors.

241
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:04,105
Pow.

242
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:08,101
Aah!

243
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,098
Whoosh whoosh.

244
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:18,117
It's a wrap for real Joker and his posse.

245
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,115
Pew pew pew.

246
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,091
He's getting inside the cockpit.

247
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:37,119
It's all your fault, you game freak.

248
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:41,121
You're Captain Slash?

249
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:49,110
Batman, if digital Joker was downloaded into the nanobot

250
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:51,123
from a video game, maybe he can be uploaded

251
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:53,127
out of the nanobots and back into the game.

252
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,126
Brilliant, dude, but you'll need a stronger signal

253
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,152
'than the one on that laptop.'

254
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,167
Transfer the signal to this.

255
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:14,173
Whoosh zap

256
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,175
crash.

257
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:35,171
How did I get back in here?

258
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,172
And who are you?

259
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:39,178
Nightwing.

260
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:43,195
And it's game over.

261
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:52,171
Aw, pudding, at least, we got our family back together again.

262
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:55,176
And Marty has even more ideas.

263
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,216
I wonder if The Penguin has these staffing problems.
