1
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,024
Uhh! I knew I should have splurged for the turbo.

2
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:21,030
Aah!

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,026
Whoa!

4
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,026
I take it those weren't pigeons.

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,033
Look.

6
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,041
' "S. W."'

7
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,047
pew pew pew.

8
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,050
Uh-oh.

9
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,054
They're gone.

10
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:00,062
Great, now the guys in hero suits are shooting at us.

11
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:11,129
You got them on video?

12
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:13,115
'A city traffic camera'

13
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,144
'recorded their getaway.'

14
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:21,119
Whoa. Look at the wheels his sidekick gets.

15
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:23,138
And last week, when killer Croc managed to escape us.

16
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,132
He must have had their help, too.

17
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,135
That time they didn't show themselves.

18
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,145
They're getting bolder.

19
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,149
So what do you think, alternate versions of us

20
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:32,135
from a parallel universe?

21
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,143
Or maybe our matter-antimatter twins.

22
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,144
You've been reading too many comic books.

23
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,148
You left out video games.

24
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:40,144
I thought you might need a reminder.

25
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,153
Bruce and Dick have an appointment

26
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,150
with their friends the Mallorys.

27
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:44,186
Andy Mallory?

28
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:47,161
Alright, I'll go.

29
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,182
But I'm not gonna have any fun.

30
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,181
Whoo-hoo!

31
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,173
And where, exactly, did you leave my brother?

32
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,177
Too slow.

33
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,187
'Maybe!'

34
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,172
But I got style.

35
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:06,185
Yee-haw!

36
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,185
Yeah, you fall way cooler than I do.

37
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,187
Yet you keep trying to impress me.

38
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,178
Come on, you two.

39
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:16,180
Andy and I both appreciate you guys lending us this gear

40
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:17,193
for our climb next week.

41
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:20,196
No problem, Wayne tech developed it for the military.

42
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,194
But I'd always rather it get used for fun.

43
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:25,210
Here, let me show you how the zip line works.

44
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:29,216
Whoosh.

45
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,202
The cable's threaded with Titanium.

46
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,207
It's thin but it can hold a ton.

47
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,220
Hook your harness to the line, and..

48
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:50,245
Okay, Dick, show Andy how to hook himself in.

49
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,215
Like I'm gonna learn from a loser.

50
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,250
Hey, I was first.

51
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:58,257
- Out of my way! - Look out!

52
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,226
Brilliant.

53
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,241
Your fault.

54
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:08,255
So, how to retrieve a stuck teammate.

55
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:15,239
I guess I'll see you at fencing next week.

56
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:16,246
Dick?

57
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,269
Yeah. See ya.

58
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:24,262
Guess they'll be having a talk.

59
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,275
So will we.

60
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,265
Aw, let it go, big bro.

61
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,252
Look at all the swag you scored

62
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,264
from your chump friend.

63
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:39,284
Every little bit helps when you got a bat to squash.

64
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:49,287
Good evening and welcome to the first broadcast

65
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:53,272
of the city's newest lottery sensation..

66
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:55,310
The Gotham Millionaire Fun Ball.

67
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:05,287
I can see why you think

68
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:07,309
this might attract someone's attention.

69
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:11,329
Let's get right to it and find out our first number.

70
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,319
'Wait!'

71
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,323
Wait for me!

72
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:33,328
Oh, this is awful.

73
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,322
I can't find my ticket.

74
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:38,347
Ah! There's the ticket.

75
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,359
Ha!

76
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,372
Now, that's what I call a winning smile.

77
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,354
What a million-dollar surprise.

78
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:15,368
Now I can win the lottery and scratch off Batman at the..

79
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:17,384
Huh?

80
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,389
Hey, you stepped on my line?

81
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,411
Take your money, Joker. We'll handle the Batman.

82
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:32,396
Who asked you?

83
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,389
Yaah!

84
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:43,418
Crash.

85
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,400
Whoa! Uh! Ah!

86
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:52,435
'W and S.'

87
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,401
"Wipeout" and "Sudden Stop."

88
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,431
That's "Wrath" and "Scorn."

89
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,426
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

90
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,427
Someone has to stand up to your kind.

91
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:18,438
Joker's just trying to make a living like anyone else.

92
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:24,434
Criminals are simple, Batman, direct.

93
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,443
Joker doesn't wear a mask.

94
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:28,427
He shows his face for the world to see.

95
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:30,431
Then you won't mind doing the same?

96
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,457
You first.

97
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,540
Beep beep.

98
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:52,524
Hey, Will, sorry about missing fencing class.

99
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,530
Suddenly my schedule got jammed.

100
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:55,534
That's okay, Bruce.

101
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:56,679
I've got some extra business

102
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,522
to take care of, too.

103
00:08:58,546 --> 00:08:59,528
We'll hook up later.

104
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,554
Ciao.

105
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:03,539
What's wrong?

106
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:06,538
Sometimes our schedules are too similar.

107
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,542
Extra business, if it were a business.

108
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,541
Joker would cut us in on his take.

109
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:11,606
'All the criminals would.'

110
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,714
We're not doing it for money.

111
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,562
We're doing it for them.

112
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,541
Why bother? I don't even remember them.

113
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,551
They'd be proud of you.

114
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,546
They'd be proud of us both for taking on the Batman.

115
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,571
He's everything they hated.

116
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:30,559
That, mom, and dad, and I have in common.

117
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,563
It's funny. Last night I felt like we knew each other.

118
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,564
We were so... in sync.

119
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:40,569
Uh, don't tell me you're starting to respect him.

120
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:42,795
Little brother, you've got nothing to worry about there.

121
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,571
'In fact, now that we know we can take him.'

122
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:48,607
'It's time to move on to the next stage.'

123
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:55,573
- What's with the club meeting? - Yeah, I ain't no joiner.

124
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,589
Uh, that's true, Mr. Scarface tells me all the time

125
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,580
he works alone.

126
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:02,592
This better not be one of your teamwork schemes, Pengy.

127
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:06,592
I assure you I had nothing to do with this.

128
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:07,605
Joker?

129
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,589
Please.

130
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,596
I had no time to clean up

131
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,602
put out trail mix, grease the trapdoor.

132
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:14,622
'I invited you here.'

133
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,603
Oh, it's this one.

134
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,644
You know, I could have handled Batman myself.

135
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,623
But no, you had to take all the fun out of it.

136
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:27,624
Ah, now, just a second.

137
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:31,613
I was thrilled to have this good fellow's assistance

138
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:34,613
and I vote we hear the man out.

139
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:36,635
So, who are you and what's your racket?

140
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,628
No racket. I'm just a friend.

141
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:41,634
One who believes criminals have it tough enough

142
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:44,655
without having to deal with that rabid bat.

143
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:48,647
Scorn and I are just here to even the field.

144
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,642
What if we don't want your help?

145
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,632
That's up to you but there's a job tonight

146
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:55,654
'that can make you all infinitely rich.'

147
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:58,639
It's too ambitious for any one criminal.

148
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:00,745
But with my backup, you might be able to pull it off.

149
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,664
Engraving plates?

150
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:08,691
- For printing money? - Right.

151
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,652
They're being unloaded at the docks tonight.

152
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,683
It's too big a prize not to attract Wrath.

153
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,665
You know, it's kind of creepy

154
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,665
how you're getting into this guy's head.

155
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,662
It's like you and he are the same.

156
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,685
Not in a way that counts.

157
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:35,704
Thud.

158
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,703
Who's there?

159
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:47,725
What?

160
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,719
Nice shot, Mr. Scarface.

161
00:11:58,731 --> 00:11:59,738
Shocking.

162
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,706
So what's left for me to do?

163
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,722
Hey. Help me unload this loot.

164
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,747
Oh, good times.

165
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,746
Harbor patrol.

166
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:31,763
Uhh!

167
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,778
Crash.

168
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:45,778
Get out of here.

169
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,798
Titanium cable.

170
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,780
Bruce?

171
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:17,816
It is you.

172
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,816
We are too much alike.

173
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,799
What's the problem, bird boy

174
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,813
too scared to take me head-on?

175
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,839
What's your problem, Scorn dog?

176
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,833
Too slow to catch me?

177
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:49,847
Bang.

178
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:54,820
Not too bright, either.

179
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:57,826
Sort of like fencing class, isn't it, old pal?

180
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,817
You know who I am, don't you?

181
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,827
I wish I didn't.

182
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:02,822
Then you know why I'm going to win.

183
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:04,850
I'm willing to destroy my enemies.

184
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:08,976
You just send yours to jail.

185
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:24,875
Jail will do.

186
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:28,873
Grrr.

187
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,886
- Where's Wrath? - Move it, dummy!

188
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:38,875
I'm outta here.

189
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:46,907
Splash

190
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,927
bang.

191
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:28,926
Where is he?

192
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,928
He's on speakerphone.

193
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:33,913
You failed us, friend.

194
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,918
We barely got out of there with our feathers intact.

195
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,925
I'll make it up to you and then some

196
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,930
'because I now know who Batman is.'

197
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,939
'And I'm going to rid the city of him once and for all.'

198
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,928
Did you hear that, dummy?

199
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,934
That'll be my gift to you.

200
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,935
Let's go.

201
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,951
'Next stop... Wayne Mansion.'

202
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,951
Where's your smile, Joker?

203
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:57,965
It's the end of the Batman.

204
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,971
Hmmh.

205
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:03,952
I can't believe it.

206
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:04,956
Will and Andy's parents

207
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,959
were notorious jewel thieves.

208
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,954
Explains the Mallory money.

209
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,968
Eventually they got caught and were sent to prison

210
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,952
around the same time my parents died.

211
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:14,967
So what's our next move?

212
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,970
We pay the Mallory brothers a visit.

213
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:19,985
'Unless we get to you first.'

214
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:21,993
Unh!

215
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:40,016
Whoosh.

216
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:47,001
I'm sorry, sir, he came up behind me as I opened the clock.

217
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:50,014
It's alright. Just stay hidden somewhere safe.

218
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,012
Come on out, Dickie bird.

219
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:59,004
We got a score to settle.

220
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:02,021
'Right behind you, Andrew.'

221
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,039
Yaah!

222
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:14,055
'I should have known you were Batman, Bruce.'

223
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,033
You were always so civic-minded.

224
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:19,053
It ends here and now.

225
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,036
'I destroy this place.'

226
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,059
'I destroy everything you are.'

227
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,058
'And then I'll destroy you.'

228
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:41,064
Somewhere safe, he says.

229
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,059
'Gotcha, Dickie.'

230
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,056
'It's over, Bruce.'

231
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,064
You've forgotten home court advantage.

232
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:54,052
'You have no court left.'

233
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:55,094
You'd be surprised.

234
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,101
Unh! Ah!

235
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:15,109
Huh? Aah!

236
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,126
You come to our house?

237
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,134
'Ah-ahem.'

238
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:40,134
Is it over?

239
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:46,112
If I go to jail, I'll tell everyone who you are.

240
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:48,108
You'll be a target the rest of your life.

241
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:50,111
But I swear, I'll never tell a soul

242
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:52,109
if you just let us go.

243
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,138
But that really would destroy everything I am.

244
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:58,119
You think I'm kidding, Batman?

245
00:18:58,143 --> 00:18:59,137
You're finished! Through!

246
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,121
Hear me? It's over!

247
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:05,150
Get ready to be famous, Dickie.

248
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:10,145
So that's it? He tells and there's no more Batman?

249
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,158
I'm afraid so.

250
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,159
It was great while it lasted.

251
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:20,139
Bad night, boys?

252
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:21,157
Joker, hurry, uncuff us.

253
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,184
Oh, I'll do better than that.

254
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,152
'I'll completely unhinge you.'

255
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:30,148
What? You can't! We know who he is. We'll tell you!

256
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,173
Batman is..

257
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,157
'Destroying you is my game.'

258
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,200
And I won't have anyone stealing my fun.

259
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:49,179
'So does this mean we're back in business?'

260
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:51,186
'I don't think anyone's telling secrets'

261
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,206
'anytime soon.'
