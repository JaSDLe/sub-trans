1
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,031
Ohh! Unh!

2
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:38,026
'Working late?'

3
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,050
We're gonna need to see your employee ID.

4
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,047
Either Halloween came early

5
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,057
or someone likes playing dress-up.

6
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,063
Whoa! Unh!

7
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,101
Uh, okay. Which one do I clobber?

8
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,106
Batman?

9
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:43,108
Unh!

10
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:04,113
He's gotta be in here somewhere.

11
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:07,122
'There's no other doors, no windows, no air vents.'

12
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:10,110
Your imposter must have found some other way out.

13
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:13,116
You sure you don't have a twin brother?

14
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,155
Let's go.

15
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,228
Play that back again.

16
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:40,218
I've heard of copycat crooks, but this guy has you down cold.

17
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:43,231
There's one important difference.

18
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,249
The other Batman is left-handed.

19
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,230
Another break-in, this time at the Gotham

20
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:55,214
lens-grinding plant.

21
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,256
Let's go do some grinding of our own.

22
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,264
He's out cold just like the other one.

23
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:33,268
I'm ready to knock Batman on his butt!

24
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,263
Uh, you know what I mean.

25
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:37,295
Stay sharp. He's good.

26
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,301
Come here. I've got something for you.

27
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:54,317
Flash?

28
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,312
Too slow.

29
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,335
Hyah!

30
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,337
Uh!

31
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,335
Err!

32
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,337
Whoo.

33
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:52,354
Not again.

34
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:03,455
Let's look at what we have.

35
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,363
Both thieves stole precision optics, a prism and a lens.

36
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:09,355
They both dressed as heroes

37
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,363
and had all their skills and powers.

38
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:14,371
Definitely a pattern.

39
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,389
Hmm.

40
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,395
Something's not right.

41
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:23,387
Do you hear that?

42
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,367
Finally. I searched the whole city.

43
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,376
It took me over an hour to find this place.

44
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,413
Easy, kid. I'm on your side.

45
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:36,393
Huh?

46
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,395
I came as soon as I heard about the flash robbery.

47
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,381
How'd you get in here?

48
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,393
The entrance is eight feet of solid rock!

49
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,385
Easy!

50
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,386
When I vibrate my molecules, I create an energy field

51
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,391
that allows me to pass through solid objects.

52
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,408
But how do we know you're not the guy we're looking for.

53
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,410
Look at the screen.

54
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:55,398
- The lightning bolt. - It's backwards.

55
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:58,401
- He's a mirror image. - Mirrors?

56
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:01,400
Just like the left-handed Batman.

57
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,412
Did you say mirrors? I know exactly who's doing this.

58
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:03,415
This is bad. This is really bad.

59
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,411
Whoa, whoa! Slow down.

60
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:06,421
Sorry. I get excited.

61
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:08,423
I know who's doing this. Dr. Samuel Scudder.

62
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,418
A brilliant optical physicist from my hometown Central City.

63
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,437
Calls himself Mirror Master.

64
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,432
Master Bruce, you really must tell me

65
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,432
when you have guests down here.

66
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,428
Food!

67
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,424
Do you mind? I'm starving.

68
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:26,447
By all means.

69
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,454
And you thought I ate fast.

70
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:36,438
Sorry. My metabolism.

71
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:38,444
I'll come back with seconds.

72
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,459
Flash, what do you know about this Mirror Master?

73
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,484
He's the most powerful villain I've ever faced.

74
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,452
He's gone way beyond the looking glass.

75
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,461
There's nothing he can't do with mirrors.

76
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:48,462
It looks like he's discovered a way to capture

77
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:50,453
someone's reflection and turn it into

78
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,467
a three-dimensional henchman one that can escape

79
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:54,453
through mirrors, too.

80
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,467
What's he doing in Gotham?

81
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,486
And why's he stealing stuff like lenses?

82
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:09,477
So smooth and cool like glass.

83
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,485
It's only an energized reflection, Smoke.

84
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,474
But so beautiful.

85
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:16,479
Like a statue.

86
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,477
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, my dear

87
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,520
and I have my eye on bigger things.

88
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,486
Well done.

89
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,499
Only one more component and my specular trap

90
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:31,491
will be complete.

91
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,512
Then the entire city of Gotham and every beautiful

92
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:39,521
and rich person in it will be at my mercy.

93
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,512
- What is it? - Intruder.

94
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:48,520
At the Gotham city observatory

95
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,545
and science museum.

96
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,540
Hate to eat and run.

97
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,537
So, Bats, where is the observatory?

98
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,527
Gotham hill. About two miles from here.

99
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:09,546
We should go in... together.

100
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,575
- Does he ever slow down? - No.

101
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,556
It's about time. What kept you?

102
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,550
There's nothing to worry about, guys.

103
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:32,569
False alarm. Sorry.

104
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,580
I did a quick run-through of the place, everything looks..

105
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,570
What did you do that for?

106
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:43,587
The guard's hair is parted on the other side.

107
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,593
- Huh. - Who did this to you?

108
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,617
Y-you did.

109
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:00,620
Where's Mirror Master?

110
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,628
We better check the place again.

111
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,633
Ah. The final piece.

112
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,646
We have company.

113
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,655
We're not alone.

114
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:41,629
Hey. A mirror me!

115
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:44,646
You're about to get seven years of bad luck.

116
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,692
Not bad. Do you practice in the mirror, too?

117
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:00,741
Hyah!

118
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:06,708
- Stop copying me! - Stop copying me!

119
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:09,714
- Oh. So you can talk. - Oh. So you can talk.

120
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,720
- Cut it out! - Cut it out!

121
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,726
- Quit it! - Quit it!

122
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,722
I like to smell my feet.

123
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:17,715
You like to smell your feet?

124
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,743
How'd I fall for that?

125
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:24,758
Ohh!

126
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,771
Hmm!

127
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,809
See ya.

128
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,818
Ready for the portal ray.

129
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,838
That's far enough, Mirror Master.

130
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:45,804
Batman and Robin I expected, but, Flash

131
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,817
you're a long way from Central City.

132
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,839
I took the fast lane.

133
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:58,834
Well, let me leave you with some shattering news.

134
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:02,864
Soon, all of Gotham will be in reflection.

135
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,851
Hold on.

136
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,868
Whoa!

137
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:29,880
- Tingly. - Whew.

138
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,879
What is Mirror Master trying to build, some kind of laser

139
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:46,870
a mass hypnotizer, a hologram projector?

140
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:47,881
We're missing his motive.

141
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:49,872
If we knew what he wanted, we could figure out

142
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:50,887
how he intends to get it.

143
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:54,895
Maybe he's building the world's ugliest chandelier.

144
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,878
What're you doing?

145
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,906
Pacing. Helps me think.

146
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,921
Smoke, my dear, it's time.

147
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:16,927
And now, Gotham, you're mine.

148
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,937
Did someone forget to pay the electric bill?

149
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,950
"All of Gotham will be in reflection."

150
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:08,982
Aah!

151
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,984
Ohh!

152
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,001
Get down now!

153
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:40,991
They're trapped.

154
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,994
There was a massive drain on Gotham's power grid

155
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,018
right before it happened.

156
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,013
'It was centered around this point.'

157
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,036
Come, my dear. Our prize awaits.

158
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,025
The only thing that awaits you is a prison cell.

159
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,006
Batman and Flash.

160
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,019
It's a wonder you escaped the effects of my device

161
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:07,013
but then again, you hero boys

162
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:09,019
seem to have that kind of luck.

163
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:12,024
What're you planning, to rob the city blind?

164
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,024
In a way.

165
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,018
I plan to collect the richest

166
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,020
100 people in the city..

167
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:20,019
All trapped in glass and ransom them.

168
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:22,038
We're talking billions, and if they don't pay up

169
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:26,047
I break them into a billion pieces.

170
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:30,064
Tell me how to reverse what you've done.

171
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,047
Gentlemen, this device cannot only trap you

172
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:39,039
inside your reflection.

173
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:43,055
It can exile you to the mirror dimension permanently.

174
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,081
Time to go through the looking glass.

175
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,097
Unh!

176
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,090
We're inside his mirror.

177
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,101
I can't vibrate out of here. We're trapped.

178
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,100
What're you doing?

179
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:26,086
Making sure they never get out.

180
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,101
Uh, Bats, I think we're in trouble.

181
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,130
Where's your portal ray?

182
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:34,127
'He took it!'

183
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:44,123
Unh!

184
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,160
Thanks for the help, Bats.

185
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:12,165
Now for Gotham.

186
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,172
This should change things back.

187
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,165
Where'd Bruce go? He was just here.

188
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:41,199
And why am I suddenly standing on my serving tray?

189
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,200
Good. Just checking.

190
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:57,178
- Everything's back to normal. - Thanks.

191
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,185
I should be thanking you.

192
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,179
If you hadn't grabbed that portal ray..

193
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:01,192
It was an impulsive move

194
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,222
something I learned from you.

195
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,227
I'll have them behind bars in no time.

196
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,227
Not fast enough for me.
