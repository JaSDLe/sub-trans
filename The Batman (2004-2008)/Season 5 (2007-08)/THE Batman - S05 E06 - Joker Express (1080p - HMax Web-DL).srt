1
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:17,040
Wow. Today was so busy.

2
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,023
It wasn't even funny.

3
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:26,016
Miss Potter.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,006
Ha ha ha!

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,049
Sorry. I.. Excuse me.

6
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:36,032
Miss Potter?

7
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:38,030
Ha ha ha!

8
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,036
Whoa!

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,030
Miss Potter!

10
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:49,062
Ha ha ha!

11
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,049
Huh!

12
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:56,034
What's so funny?

13
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,059
Ha ha ha!

14
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,043
- Going somewhere? - I don't think so.

15
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,061
Ha ha ha!

16
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:07,076
Whoosh.

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,057
Tortured smile, uncontrollable laughing fits..

18
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,067
Joker.

19
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:16,074
Hardly seems like a simple

20
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:18,089
bank scheme is worth his time.

21
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:22,084
Ha ha ha!

22
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,094
Who said it was simple?

23
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,139
Vroom

24
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:11,147
screech boom

25
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:21,148
vroom.

26
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,189
'We did what we could'

27
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,157
'but the outbreak was too scattered.'

28
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,192
Too random to contain.

29
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,154
Tell me about it.

30
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:53,165
I had my people all over Gotham

31
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,159
trying to chase down these giggle bandits.

32
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:58,162
Fortunately, the change was only temporary.

33
00:02:58,186 --> 00:03:01,161
The victims have no idea what came over them or why.

34
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:03,161
Clearly, Joker infected these people to do

35
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,171
his criminal bidding. But how?

36
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,556
That's the million dollar question.

37
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,229
None of his victims seem to have anything in common.

38
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,175
'What kind of person lets himself'

39
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,400
'go all giggly for that goon?'

40
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,192
Hey, it wasn't their fault.

41
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,193
Joker obviously got to them.

42
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:21,186
Maybe he used a gas or a powder or..

43
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,192
Ha ha. Something, I don't know.

44
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,193
You saw the tox screens, there was no trace

45
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,193
of anything in the victims.

46
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,202
- Ha ha ha! - Hey, I'm getting serious here.

47
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,230
So.. So am I.

48
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,229
Oh, boy.

49
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:51,240
'The Jewelry store. But who are they chasing?'

50
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,222
Batman, we've got a situ..

51
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:59,258
- Ha ha! - Uh!

52
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,266
Oh, no, you don't!

53
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,232
Hey! Uh! Whoa!

54
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,241
Ha ha ha!

55
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,235
Come on, Batgirl, snap out of it.

56
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,243
Ha ha ha! Uh!

57
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:14,234
Ah!

58
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,248
Ha ha ha!

59
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:19,275
Okay. This time I'm not fooling around.

60
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,305
Ha ha ha!

61
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:46,265
- Batgirl. - Huh?

62
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,310
Ha ha ha!

63
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:56,303
Clank Ha ha ha!

64
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,299
Is it safe?

65
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:09,322
A brief time-out should reset her personality.

66
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,304
- Batman? - How do you feel?

67
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,295
Confused. What's going on?

68
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,305
Someone got a case of the giggles.

69
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,338
Who?

70
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,318
No!

71
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:26,349
I must have been really out of it. I hate pearls.

72
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,370
Do you know where you were taking the stolen jewels?

73
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,349
'No, but I've got an idea.'

74
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,347
Looks like the fish are biting tonight.

75
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:55,350
Ahoy, land lovers! Stopped by to see me off?

76
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:57,361
How thoughtful!

77
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,348
Punch. Get it!

78
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,377
Vroom.

79
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,386
Bon voyage, Bats!

80
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:12,368
Great. Now what?

81
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,394
We figure out how he got to you.

82
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:27,387
Slurp slurp Cute jacket.

83
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:29,386
This tanks.

84
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,373
Got a better idea?

85
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:32,391
No, but that doesn't make following

86
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:35,373
the shopping queen tank any less.

87
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,759
Joker did something to Barbara at some point during her day.

88
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,680
Yeah, and by retracing her steps

89
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,395
we're hoping to figure out when and where.

90
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,388
But, Bruce, we just spent the last two hours

91
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,400
watching her shop for handbags!

92
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:49,432
Well, you're in luck. I think she moved on to the main event.

93
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,407
Comic books?

94
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,397
Shoes.

95
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,424
Argh!

96
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:57,425
Ooh!

97
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:04,415
'After her morning shopping trip'

98
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,413
Barbara took the train to school.

99
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:09,437
Let's just hope they don't have a shoe store on campus.

100
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:22,453
Argh.

101
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,477
We can use some help here.

102
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,504
We got our own problems.

103
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,488
'And this was the scene last evening.'

104
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:28,491
'If this particular giggle bandit'

105
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,494
'looks familiar, he should.'

106
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,495
'It's none other than billionaire Bruce Wayne'

107
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,512
'proving even Gotham's elite can fall prey'

108
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,505
'to Joker's schemes.'

109
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,508
Annoying, isn't it? Welcome to my world.

110
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,509
Of course, all charges have been dropped

111
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,521
against Mr. Wayne and his companions

112
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:47,511
despite a scuffle with the police.

113
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:49,512
The authorities are lucky to have sustained

114
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,529
as few injuries as they did.

115
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,554
'This time Joker's victims threw'

116
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,513
'their stolen property'

117
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,516
'off the East Canal Bridge.'

118
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,546
Wait a minute.

119
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,543
That woman looks familiar.

120
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,529
She was on the train.

121
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:07,526
Yeah. Who could forget that hat?

122
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,536
The boy with the piercing, the old man.

123
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,542
They were there, too. They all were.

124
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:14,544
- The commuter train. - Joker's using the train.

125
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:17,560
How does he brainwash people with the train?

126
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:27,576
The lights.

127
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:43,599
Vroom.

128
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,578
'Life getting you down, bubby?'

129
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,591
'Feel like you're just along for the ride?'

130
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:55,591
Then relax, clear your minds

131
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,619
and look into the lights.

132
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,622
'The peaceful lights.'

133
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,601
'The soothing lights.'

134
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,612
beep beep.

135
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,631
Make sure everyone stays out of the first car.

136
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,609
Whoa. Whoa. Blast public transportation.

137
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,627
What's the matter with the lights?

138
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:24,637
Your scheme has just been derailed.

139
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,623
Excuse me. I'm the conductor here.

140
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:32,632
And all passengers must get their tickets punched.

141
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:36,649
Boys.

142
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,632
Thud thud swoosh.

143
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,632
Well, isn't that hospitable?

144
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:53,670
Judy wants you to have his seat.

145
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,672
- Whoa! - Whoa!

146
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:05,660
Hee-yah!

147
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:07,686
Whoa! Uh!

148
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,682
Thud.

149
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:23,688
If you'll excuse me, I've got business to conduct.

150
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:26,686
Boom.

151
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,671
Runaway train anyone?

152
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,698
Ha ha ha!

153
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:40,680
We're heading for a dead-end.

154
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:42,692
Well, we've got all those passengers back there.

155
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:43,701
And no air bags.

156
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:45,713
Grab my arm.

157
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:54,714
Boom boom.

158
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,701
- Whoa! - Whoa!

159
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:01,728
Screech - Whoa! - Whoa!

160
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,733
Crash.

161
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:09,729
Come on. We make the rest of this trip on foot.

162
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,764
It's all caves and tunnels down here.

163
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,733
Like a giant hunk of Swiss cheese.

164
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:28,743
In the late 1800s Gotham was a thriving coal mining town.

165
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,733
Who knows how many tunnels riddle this city's foundation.

166
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:36,734
'Ooh! Crime fighter and his truth confessor, all in one!'

167
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,756
'I'm so glad you decided to drop in!'

168
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,764
Ah!

169
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,755
'Must have been exciting in those days.'

170
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,770
chink chink.

171
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,790
'Such dangerous work down in the mines.'

172
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,778
'What, with all the accidents, cave-ins'

173
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,780
'and poison gas.'

174
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:07,805
hiss

175
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,799
screech thud.

176
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:20,801
Aww! Mmm, mmm, mmm. End of the line.

177
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:34,832
Rise and shine, Bat gang!

178
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,819
Look! You have your very own cage!

179
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:49,823
Just like Ralph here. Hee! Ha ha ha!

180
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,827
It's a pretty good haul, don't you think?

181
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:55,819
Just imagine what I'll get for these on the internet!

182
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:58,826
Let me guess. You're going to run us over with your train.

183
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,834
Real original.

184
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,838
I assure you, that joke is too obvious

185
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,831
even for me.

186
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,831
No, I've cooked up a far more crushing defeat

187
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,847
for my little cave bats. Heh heh heh!

188
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:13,843
You see, you're right about all the tunnels under Gotham.

189
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,837
The place is <i>lousy with them.</i>

190
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:18,868
So I thought I'd spruce them up a bit.

191
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,855
Dynamite.

192
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,860
Miles of it. Just imagine.

193
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:28,848
All these tunnels blowing at once.

194
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:32,856
The entire city swallowed into a great big sinkhole.

195
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,875
Ahh. Ashes to ashes, and all that rot.

196
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,864
Ooh! Love to chat! But I've got a schedule to keep.

197
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:41,893
Ta-ta!

198
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,908
'This is the cuckoo-choo-choo! Now leaving on track nine.'

199
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,877
Next stop, city limits and the end of Gotham as we know it.

200
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,889
Mwah! All aboard!

201
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:56,912
Honk

202
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:05,913

203
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:15,905
beep beep beep.

204
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,914
- GPS? - It can tell us where we are.

205
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,909
I can tell you where we are.

206
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,906
Stuck in a cave miles below the surface.

207
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,903
I hate to say it, Batman. But he's right.

208
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,905
There's no way we can catch Joker now.

209
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,922
- We've got nothing. - Not so.

210
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,952
'We've got explosives.'

211
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:42,960
boom.

212
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:49,935
- Good heavens. - Sorry about the mess, Alfred.

213
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,955
The front door too conventional for you, sir?

214
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,974
Vroom.

215
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,949
Well, hear that?

216
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:11,980
Screech

217
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,987
beep Get in.

218
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,001
Beep.

219
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,013
You gotta be kidding.

220
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,007
Beep beep beep.

221
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,026
'Train approaching.'

222
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:03,027
honk honk honk

223
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,044
vroom

224
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:09,033
vroom vroom.

225
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,034
That's it. We're moving.

226
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,033
Only three more miles to the city limits.

227
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:28,033
I'll miss you, Gotham and the swell times we had together.

228
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:32,039
But most of all, I'll miss the good old batty man.

229
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:33,044
I will.. Huh?

230
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,062
Beep beep beep.

231
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:52,076
Oh, I was so close.

232
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:56,087
Boom boom.

233
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:02,096
It seems like we're always saying goodbye.

234
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:09,074
Clang clang Huh?

235
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,090
Cover me.

236
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:18,102
Whoo hoo hoo! Circus time!

237
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:21,107
Ha ha ha!

238
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:25,118
Ooh!

239
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,132
Clang.

240
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,127
Ugh.

241
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:52,131
Ha ha ha!

242
00:18:57,142 --> 00:18:59,121
Say goodbye, Gotham!

243
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,130
Ha ha ha!

244
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:01,162
Click

245
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:05,167
click click click Huh?

246
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,144
- Argh. - Sorry, Joker.

247
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:11,173
You can't send a signal without a battery.

248
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:14,136
Ahh-h-h-h-h!

249
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,138
I've been railroaded?

250
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,171
Aa-a-a-h!

251
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,165
Screech.

252
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,169
- Oh. - Last stop, Joker.

253
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:36,168
You know, it's a really shame to seal it up.

254
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,169
Maybe you should expand. Add a Batgirl cave.

255
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:40,201
Batgirl cave?

256
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,176
I'm old enough to have my own cave.

257
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,182
I can park my cycle there, bring in some exercise equipment

258
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:47,166
a couple of beanbags.

259
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,179
How come she gets her own cave?

260
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,210
I want my own cave!

261
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,172
Nobody's getting their own cave.

262
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:53,180
Well, gotta go.

263
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:55,178
And where are you off to in such a hurry?

264
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:56,187
Late for a train?

265
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:58,219
Midnight madness sale at Gotham Shoes.

266
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,202
- You coming with me? - She's a regular Joker.
