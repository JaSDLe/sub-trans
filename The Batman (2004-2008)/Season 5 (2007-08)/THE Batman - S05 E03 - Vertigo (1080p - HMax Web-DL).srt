1
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,046
Beep beep

2
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,066
boom.

3
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,056
Really, it looks fine.

4
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,049
Fine's not good enough, Bruce.

5
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:06,074
It has to be perfect.

6
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:23,077
What are you doing? We'll be late for the party!

7
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,073
Oh, come on. It will be fun.

8
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:27,299
And this will give you more time to work on your makeup.

9
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,101
Not-not that you need it.

10
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,112
Aah!

11
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:02,136
Boom.

12
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,141
'Where'd he go?'

13
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:15,114
You're making kids sick, Wayne.

14
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:17,131
Next time, I won't let you off so easily.

15
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:20,156
Sick? What are you talking about?

16
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:26,146
Rip Are we having fun yet?

17
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,262
'It started about three weeks ago'

18
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:39,258
and it's been hitting kids especially hard.

19
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:41,259
First dizziness, then nausea.

20
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,265
Bet it's the flu. I had it one time.

21
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,275
You wouldn't believe what came out of me.

22
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:48,285
But there's no fever, and it stops just like that.

23
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:51,284
One other thing, it comes on mostly at night.

24
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:54,293
Do the cases cluster around any particular neighborhood?

25
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:57,280
Here's the map we made.

26
00:04:57,304 --> 00:04:58,297
Hey, isn't that Wayne Labs?

27
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,300
It's right in the middle of it all.

28
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,319
Uh, not that that means anything.

29
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:13,292
My people at Wayne labs are so careful.

30
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:15,302
I don't understand how something like this could happen.

31
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:18,305
Probably just a virus or something. No biggie.

32
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,309
Tell me that after you've gone to med school.

33
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,344
How's he doing?

34
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,321
The dizziness is gone but they're telling me now

35
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:27,316
he broke his arm in two places when he fell off his bike.

36
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,310
Don't you worry. The doctors here are the best.

37
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,314
Need any more help with the bills?

38
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:32,322
Oh, no.

39
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,342
You've already done so much for us.

40
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:36,324
'Glad to help.'

41
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:37,325
Who's that guy?

42
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:38,335
His name's Oliver Queen.

43
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:41,321
Runs a big company in Star City.

44
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,364
- You know him? - In a way.

45
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:56,350
- 'How you doing?' - Almost done with the samples.

46
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,353
Don't think it's coming from Wayne Labs, huh?

47
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,348
I've had everything else checked. I..

48
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:02,375
What?

49
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,388
Arrow! It's me, Batman.

50
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,358
- Thought you were someone else. - I kind of figured that.

51
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,373
Robin. This is Green Arrow.

52
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:19,376
Yeah. The arrows and the greenness kind of give it away.

53
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,374
You're pretty far from Star City.

54
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:23,366
I thought you could use some help.

55
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,375
Gotham's favorite millionaire

56
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,366
has fallen in with the wrong crowd.

57
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,372
What do you mean?

58
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,381
People are getting sick around here

59
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,383
and it's because of that dirt bag Bruce Wayne.

60
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:31,388
Dirt bag?

61
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,374
If some kind of illness

62
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,391
is being caused by Wayne Labs

63
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,382
I guarantee you, Bruce Wayne doesn't know about it.

64
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:40,388
Bet he does. And I know who he's working with, too.

65
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,398
Whoa! Oh! Unh!

66
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:45,411
- 'Are we having an earthquake?' - An earthquake?

67
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:51,430
Ah!

68
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,393
- Ah! - You alright?

69
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,429
I think I'm gonna, gonna..

70
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:00,408
I'm starting to feel it now.

71
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:02,431
- He must be close. - Who?

72
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,428
We've got company.

73
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:21,428
Those headpieces they're wearing

74
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:24,422
must make them immune to the dizziness.

75
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:25,847
Let's see if they're immune to this!

76
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:31,458
Hmm?

77
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,479
Count Vertigo!

78
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:55,497
Too many. Can't focus.

79
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,494
Ah! Aa-aa-aa!

80
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,502
'Help!'

81
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,494
Help!

82
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,495
Ah!

83
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,489
'Hold on, kid!'

84
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:27,510
whoosh.

85
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,521
'There they are!'

86
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,565
- You okay? - Yeah, but he's not.

87
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,550
How are you doing?

88
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:17,544
Remember that time I had the flu?

89
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:20,564
That would be an improvement right now.

90
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,562
Sir?

91
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,564
I brought the medicine you requested.

92
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:27,579
Oh. Excuse me.

93
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,568
You didn't say you had company.

94
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:32,586
It's alright, Alfred.

95
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,558
Haven't I seen you before?

96
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:39,597
Perhaps the renaissance fair?

97
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:43,576
You were driving that limo.

98
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,572
The limo that belongs to..

99
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:46,583
'...Bruce Wayne.'

100
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,572
Now do you see why I'm so sure of him... Ollie?

101
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,573
Hey! How did you know?

102
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,580
He is The Batman, after all.

103
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:56,594
Now, let's hear about that man with the metal eye.

104
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,609
You know him, don't you?

105
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,584
A long time ago..

106
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,582
<i>I was a spoiled rich kid..</i>

107
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:06,596
<i>Couldn't have cared less about running my company.</i>

108
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,601
<i>Just wanted to have fun.</i>

109
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,591
<i>Life was good..</i>

110
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,620
<i>Until I ran into some fog.</i>

111
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:16,609
<i>I started feeling dizzy.</i>

112
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,616
<i>And it only got worse.</i>

113
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,599
<i>Then I saw another ship.</i>

114
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,619
<i>The man with the metal eye was on board.</i>

115
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:26,609
<i>His name's Count Vertigo.</i>

116
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,621
<i>He was a scientist who used to work for me.</i>

117
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,610
<i>I fired him for stealing technology</i>

118
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,630
<i>and now, I was seeing firsthand how he used that technology.</i>

119
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:35,650
<i>I got dizzier and dizzier.</i>

120
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:41,621
<i>I tried to save myself</i>

121
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:43,645
<i>but Vertigo was merciless.</i>

122
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,661
<i>Sometime the next morning, I washed up onshore.</i>

123
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:07,660
<i>I figured the search parties would find</i>

124
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,653
<i>a rich, important guy like me</i>

125
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:10,668
<i>in a day or two.</i>

126
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:14,684
<i>All I had to do was find some shade and wait.</i>

127
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,671
<i>I never felt so helpless before.</i>

128
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:27,678
<i>Only one thing kept me going.</i>

129
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:31,674
<i>I knew that someday, I'd get another shot at Vertigo</i>

130
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:32,710
<i>and I wanted to be ready.</i>

131
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,699
<i>Those first couple of days were hard.</i>

132
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,709
<i>Then I got an idea.</i>

133
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,752
<i>From that day on, my life was transformed.</i>

134
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:20,750
<i>It seemed like nothing was impossible.</i>

135
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,739
<i>Every day, I built up my strength</i>

136
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,754
<i>tested my limits.</i>

137
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,772
<i>And kept on going.</i>

138
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,749
<i>I became strong, fearless.</i>

139
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,770
<i>All thanks to one thing.</i>

140
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,759
<i>After a few years on the island</i>

141
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:54,781
<i>I finally got some company.</i>

142
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,783
When I came back, Count Vertigo had disappeared.

143
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:08,785
Then I heard about people getting sick near Wayne Labs

144
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,776
and I figured Vertigo had teamed up with Bruce Wayne.

145
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,785
He's stealing from me. That's what he's doing.

146
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,780
And he sent his men out tonight to make sure

147
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,812
you wouldn't get anywhere near him again.

148
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,783
Well, I'm going back anyway.

149
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:22,822
Not without me.

150
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,861
These footprints

151
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,829
they go right into a blank wall.

152
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,859
This wall doesn't belong here.

153
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:05,865
Allow me.

154
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:10,838
Concentrated acid.

155
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,867
Phosphorus would have been faster.

156
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,860
Whoa.

157
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:21,857
'Looks like a gyroscope.'

158
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,862
He built it right under my nose.

159
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,846
And at night, when he tested it

160
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,865
people got sick around here.

161
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,880
- What's it for? - Power.

162
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:36,859
'Imagine, a half million people'

163
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:39,878
unable to walk, unable to see straight.

164
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:41,904
That's how I was

165
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,874
before I created my eye.

166
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:46,867
Dizzy, helpless.

167
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,885
But just as the eye cured my affliction.

168
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:51,914
'I found it could inflict it on others.'

169
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,880
But with this, my powers

170
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:56,895
become almost limitless.

171
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,888
I'm going to cripple your city, Batman

172
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:02,901
and plunder it without a shot being fired.

173
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:04,926
And that's just the beginning.

174
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,906
Eventually, the whole world will stagger

175
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,919
and fall to the feet of Count Vertigo.

176
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:15,934
You miserable..

177
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,920
Your aim is a little off.

178
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:33,913
Make sure I don't see them again.

179
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:34,938
Beep.

180
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,921
- Put these in your ears. - What are they?

181
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,922
They'll seal off your inner ear so..

182
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:41,951
Just put them in!

183
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,963
- 'Still dizzy?' - They'll do.

184
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,968
Over here, guys.

185
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,978
- Ah! - Come on.

186
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,962
What makes you so sure he's hitting the mint?

187
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,979
Once a month, they send out new $100 bills..

188
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,993
And that's tonight.

189
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:17,058
- We're getting closer. - Got your plugs?

190
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,043
Got an improvement.

191
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,070
Crash

192
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,078
boom boom boom

193
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:06,091
beep.

194
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,080
- Arrow, come on! - But Vertigo.

195
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:21,103
Come on!

196
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:36,130
Arrow.

197
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,113
Clank.

198
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,113
Three times he's gotten away from me.

199
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,126
There won't be a fourth.

200
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,156
Thud.

201
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,141
Let's see how good an archer

202
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,177
you'll be without those fingers.

203
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:23,167
Huh?

204
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,182
Smack.

205
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,186
Argh!

206
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:55,205
Getting dizzy?

207
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:03,209
- 'No!' - Arrow!

208
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,542
What did you think I was gonna do?

209
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,227
You know, I like the set-up you have here.

210
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:48,239
Gives me some ideas for my place in Star City.

211
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:51,245
Which you're heading back to now, right?

212
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:54,238
'I guess I was a little..'

213
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:55,242
'You know.'

214
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,249
I know.

215
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:58,235
At least your partner's happy.

216
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,249
This is cool! Gives you distance.

217
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:02,265
Oh!

218
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:14,275
Then again, maybe I'll stick to our stuff.
