1
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:28,006
I had no idea this could be so stimulating.

2
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,019
Yeah, you never forget your first crime.

3
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:33,019
Radioactive phosphorus

4
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,015
just what the doctor ordered.

5
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,047
Sorry, bug boy. You're gonna need a lawyer.

6
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,063
The name is Firefly.

7
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,025
And I'd be very careful.

8
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,068
I fumble this ball, we're all toast.

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,053
Boom

10
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:53,059
Blaise, let's go.

11
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,071
Whoosh.

12
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:15,055
Beauty, brains, and cool under fire.

13
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,058
- What did I do to deserve you? - Simple.

14
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:22,086
You were very, very bad.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,063
But honestly, all I did

16
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,085
was design a few simple upgrades to your equipment.

17
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:30,069
It isn't rocket science.

18
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:32,079
No, wait, it is.

19
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:34,117
And nuclear Firefly 2.0

20
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,084
is gonna be in and out of the treasury

21
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,097
before the Bat even pulls on his tights.

22
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:41,096
'Once we have the gold, we'll steam away from Gotham'

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,092
'and never look back.'

24
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:45,121
'It'll be the sweet life for us.'

25
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:50,121
Look. We're famous.

26
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:54,296
Commissioner Gordon assures us they're doing everything

27
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,114
in their power to recover the isotopes

28
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,104
'stolen by Garfield Lynns'

29
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:00,100
'also known as Bee Man.'

30
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:02,140
I am so ready to blow this town.

31
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,112
Oh, crud!

32
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:07,149
Boom.

33
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:16,158
Garfield!

34
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,180
Beep

35
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:51,172
whoosh

36
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:58,199
boom

37
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:07,203
vroom

38
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,207
clink.

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,201
Her name's Blaise? Figures.

40
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,207
I've checked with Firefly's old associates.

41
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:39,313
Apparently, he and the girl are working on their own.

42
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,201
I wonder what he plans to do with that isotope.

43
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:46,213
A bigger mystery is, how come you always get the front seat?

44
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:48,228
Beep beep.

45
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,251
Explosion on the south side.

46
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:06,226
It's Firefly, alright.

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,236
This explosion could have been caused by the isotope.

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,254
You better check.

49
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,252
He gave you a radiation detector?

50
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,251
Why don't I get a radiation detector?

51
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:19,240
Anyone using the Batcomputer for something other than

52
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,250
downloading video game cheat codes?

53
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:22,281
Hmm?

54
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:27,249
Hey. Look what I found.

55
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:29,277
Yep, Blaise and Firefly.

56
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,252
Her real name is Dr. Jane Blaise Dale

57
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:35,262
nuclear physicist.

58
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:37,256
Quit her job at Gotham U when her project

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,272
for boosting nuclear energy output

60
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,302
was shut down over safety concerns.

61
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,267
Bruce Wayne's on the university's board.

62
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,282
So why's Brainy Jane hanging out with a creep like Firefly?

63
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,272
Chemistry.

64
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,271
Like Harley and Joker.

65
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,282
It's a bad boy thing.

66
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:57,300
I was talking about <i>this kind of chemistry.</i>

67
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,295
And I'll take weirder Science for 1000.

68
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,287
If the isotope blew up

69
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:06,289
the radiation should be off the scale

70
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:08,297
but it's barely above normal.

71
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:11,312
Where'd all that radiation go?

72
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,308
You're going to the emergency room

73
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,298
don't argue with me.

74
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:18,313
Do you want to go to jail? Pull over.

75
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:20,302
You took a lot of radiation.

76
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,344
You need to see a doctor, a real doctor.

77
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,315
I'm controlling it.

78
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm fine.

79
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:27,310
Maybe I should be worried about you.

80
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,339
Middle of summer, you crank up the heat.

81
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:34,313
It's on cold. You're the one who's burning up.

82
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:35,355
I need air.

83
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,361
Hey, I'm walking here!

84
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:48,356
Help! It's bumblebee!

85
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:55,337
Don't move. Hands in the air.

86
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,354
Now, which is it?

87
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,347
Don't move..

88
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,342
Or hands in the air?

89
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,372
Ah!

90
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,370
Smokin'.

91
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,354
No point in having special powers

92
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,379
if you don't cash in.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,373
Oh. Temperature control needs some work.

94
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,398
We have to get out of here.

95
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:29,410
Screech.

96
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,416
That's new.

97
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:40,400
Get the car.

98
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:50,419
Gah!

99
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:58,405
Dr. Blaise Dale, I presume?

100
00:06:58,429 --> 00:06:59,442
Looking for these?

101
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,410
Whoa.

102
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,430
It's gonna take more than that to douse me, kid.

103
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:13,449
Ahh!

104
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:17,655
What is your crazy guess about

105
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,429
where the missing radiation went?

106
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:22,456
Go help Batgirl. I'll wrap up Firefly.

107
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:33,466
Boom.

108
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:42,453
Thanks for getting the name right, Batman.

109
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,486
'And I'm not Firefly anymore.'

110
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,466
With your last breath call me..

111
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,484
Phosphorus.

112
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:06,508
Please, we have to go.

113
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,511
Ohh!

114
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,499
Out.

115
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:21,524
Eh, I'll get used to it.

116
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:25,491
Too hot. In the back.

117
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,529
Whatever.

118
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,495
Batman!

119
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:37,540
Unh!

120
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,532
'Stand back!'

121
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:46,533
I liked it better when he was a bug.

122
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,559
At least it got us this far. Come on.

123
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,527
What are we gonna do, Garfield?

124
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,532
You can't be in a car without setting it on fire.

125
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,540
This power's gonna take some practice, that's all.

126
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,527
Just give me a chance.

127
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,531
I'm unstoppable, Blaise.

128
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,544
The Bat can't touch me.

129
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:10,549
But neither can I.

130
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:13,574
I know. But we'll figure it out.

131
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,554
Come on, babe. The sweet life, we're this close.

132
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:21,567
I need to know you're with me.

133
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:32,595
Creak

134
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:39,591
fizz fizz fizz.

135
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,565
- Freeze! - Freeze!

136
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:43,599
Burn.

137
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,615
This way.

138
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,611
Grab the door, babe.

139
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:10,615
Now, a moment to cool down and..

140
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:14,608
Okay, so I'm still working out the temperature thing.

141
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:18,600
You know, I'm a partner not a Hench girl.

142
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,614
What do you want from me?

143
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:23,625
For one thing, the secret to maintaining that healthy glow.

144
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:27,640
Boom.

145
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,636
Unh!

146
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,639
Boom.

147
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:42,663
Aah!

148
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,666
Whoa. I could get used to this.

149
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:50,654
Lynns.

150
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:55,678
Ahh. Huh?

151
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:00,667
Aah!

152
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,664
Heat reactive carbon alloy nano fibers.

153
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,673
Durable to 4000 degrees kelvin.

154
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:13,696
Tell me, is Garfield..

155
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,660
Coming to your rescue?

156
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:16,672
I'm going with no.

157
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:18,670
He's been losing it since the accident.

158
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,664
He couldn't control the powers.

159
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:23,678
And of course you were secretly on our side the whole time.

160
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:25,704
I think she's really worried.

161
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,770
Throw all your ice pellets.

162
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:37,705
Aah!

163
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,706
Unh!

164
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,702
You took your best shot, Bats.

165
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:53,736
Care to see mine?

166
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:01,706
Ah.

167
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,734
Move.

168
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:07,732
Argh!

169
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:14,735
Whoa.

170
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:27,759
You don't carry any sunblock in that belt, do you?

171
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:34,777
No sign of him on the police scanners.

172
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:39,737
How much lead lining?

173
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,742
A centimeter all around should be

174
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,760
an effective radiation shield.

175
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:44,746
Very good, sir.

176
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,756
And as long as I've got it open

177
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,750
perhaps I could let out the shoulders.

178
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,748
Just the lining, Alfred.

179
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,751
So far, Phosphorus isn't leaking radiation only heat.

180
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,771
But as his powers outstrip his ability to control them

181
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:57,761
we may be staring at an uncontained reaction.

182
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:58,800
As in a nuclear bomb?

183
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,760
If he absorbed enough radiation, yes.

184
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:03,779
- But I don't think he did. - Whoo!

185
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,784
He's much more likely to melt down.

186
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:08,784
'Melt down? That doesn't sound good.'

187
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:11,769
'It's not, it means he'll get hot enough'

188
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:12,790
<i>to melt into the ground.</i>

189
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:15,816
<i>But not before destroying most of Gotham.</i>

190
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,786
- Where are you going? - I'm gonna scout around.

191
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,823
I'll call if I see him.

192
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,924
A guy who glows in the dark can't be too hard to find.

193
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:33,824
Vroom vroom.

194
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:39,807
What are you doing?

195
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,811
What does it look like I'm doing?

196
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:42,817
I'm hungry.

197
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:46,831
- It's raw. - Not when I'm done chewing it.

198
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,838
Garfield, your feet.

199
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:53,827
You can't eat, you can't drive.

200
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:55,832
You-you can't even stand anywhere.

201
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:56,859
This is insane!

202
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:58,832
I did this for you.

203
00:13:58,856 --> 00:13:59,835
You wanted it.

204
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,856
I didn't want this.

205
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:13,867
Aah!

206
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:17,853
Blaise?

207
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:18,881
Blaise!

208
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:23,859
Slow down, doc.

209
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,846
Where's the fire?

210
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,846
I didn't just say that.

211
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,884
Whoosh boom.

212
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,901
Working with my enemies, is that it?

213
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,878
I'm done with your powers, Garfield.

214
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:47,900
Look at you. Think you're such hot stuff? Think again.

215
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:03,924
You okay?

216
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,889
He's crazy.

217
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,899
You used to think I was hot, Blaise.

218
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,891
Oh, I'm hot, alright.

219
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,911
But I could get hotter.

220
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,922
Where's he going?

221
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,931
'Nuclear power plant.'

222
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:35,950
vroom.

223
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,954
Ha!

224
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
Zap zap zap.

225
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:04,959
Huh?

226
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,967
Get out of here!

227
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:08,985
Huh! What the..

228
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,981
Vroom vroom.

229
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:18,995
Huh? Uh! Whoa!

230
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:25,978
Whoa!

231
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:27,987
Aah!

232
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,988
Whoa!

233
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,013
Crash.

234
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,989
Give it up, Lynns.

235
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:38,994
Give up?

236
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:42,003
I'm just getting warmed up.

237
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,010
Huh!

238
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,017
Clink clink clink.

239
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,036
Like ducks in a shooting gallery.

240
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,036
Uhh!

241
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,040
Uhh! Uhh!

242
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:05,012
I'm not one of your pathetic Arkham whack jobs, Bats.

243
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:08,027
I have <i>real power.</i>

244
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:16,019
I'll break through that suit

245
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:18,022
then I'm gonna soak up every bit of radiation

246
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,031
in the reactor and pop my top.

247
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:22,020
Gotham will be a memory

248
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:25,053
but long will live the name of Phosphorus.

249
00:17:57,085 --> 00:17:58,090
Aah!

250
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:02,059
Garfield, don't do this. Please.

251
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,078
All I wanted was a big hit so I could blow this town.

252
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:10,068
Seems I can't have the hit but I can still blow this town.

253
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,084
You'll destroy <i>us.</i>

254
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:14,082
I guess some relationships are just too hot to handle, babe.

255
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,114
At least this time they'll get my name right.

256
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:31,123
'Lynns!'

257
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,111
You got to be kidding me.

258
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:40,099
Figured you'd think so.

259
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:44,133
Beep beep beep Huh? Uh! Gah!

260
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,136
Hyah!

261
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:52,133
Aah!

262
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:54,140
Huh?

263
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,146
Aah!

264
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,150
'Liquid nitrogen.'

265
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:16,173
'Something had to cool him down.'

266
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,157
If Mr. Lynns had gotten help earlier

267
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,156
maybe something could have been done.

268
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,152
Right now, only a special gas mixture

269
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:34,169
'is able to keep him under control.'

270
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,162
Garfield.

271
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:39,158
Blaise, you got my message.

272
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:41,161
I came in person to say..

273
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:43,193
Whatever spark existed between us..

274
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:46,172
It's gone.

275
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:48,179
Blaise, wait. I..

276
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,208
Wait!

277
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:58,198
It's late, Garfield, lights out.
