1
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:10,032
Higher! Higher!

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,053
Come on in!

3
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,029
What are you waiting for? Come on in!

4
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,061
Shelly! Get out of there! Hurry!

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,075
This is so Spielberg.

6
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,062
Michael? Is that you? Cool costume!

7
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:13,084
You get it from the drama department?

8
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:17,068
I'm not laughing anymore, Michael.

9
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,076
Now, take that thing off.

10
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,088
Take it off!

11
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:24,107
'Michael?'

12
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,118
Huh?

13
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:55,107
What the.. Oh!

14
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,133
- Aah! - Aah!

15
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,159
Ah-ah!

16
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,288
Clank.

17
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,309
Ooh.

18
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:58,296
I think you know why we're here, Professor Langstrom.

19
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,283
I was expecting you.

20
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:03,286
But I had nothing to do with this, I swear!

21
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,284
'I know it looks bad, but after those last'

22
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,589
man-bat experiments, I realized.

23
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,294
I could never go down that road again, and I haven't.

24
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,334
Someone has. Any ideas?

25
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,312
There was a breach in my computer's

26
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,307
security program a few weeks ago.

27
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,297
'So, it could be anyone.'

28
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,302
I'm afraid so, but if there's anything

29
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,647
I can do to help, anything at all.

30
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,329
Let's hope it's not too late for that.

31
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,357
I'll do some snooping around here in the morning.

32
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,323
But what about your school?

33
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:40,337
This is my school, ever since September.

34
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,351
Tell me you knew that.

35
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,339
He can give you the atomic weight of iridium

36
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,340
and the private phone number of the president

37
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:51,373
but does he remember I graduated high school?

38
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,347
No.

39
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,343
And did you hear those

40
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,337
big, bad frat boys when they were running off?

41
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:00,351
Squealing just like their little girlfriends!

42
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,342
You know, I actually tried to get

43
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,350
'into one of those sororities.'

44
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:05,353
'You?'

45
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:07,353
It was a long time ago, David, okay?

46
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:08,363
And did you see that girl's face

47
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:11,349
when she figured out it wasn't a costume?

48
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,361
I thought she was gonna... Justin! Shh.

49
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:16,371
Come on, Amber. Who pays attention to us?

50
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:18,377
At least, when we look like this?

51
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:20,363
Speaking of that

52
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:22,372
have you cooked up any more of those patches?

53
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:26,386
It's easy, once you have the recipe.

54
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,388
- Not again. - What?

55
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,424
The doof they gave me for a roommate.

56
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,400
What do you want?

57
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:50,665
What do you think I want, Jake?

58
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,401
This is my room too, you know?

59
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:55,411
Uh-uh. This party's by invitation only.

60
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:58,419
'And it's very exclusive.'

61
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,446
Ooh!

62
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,438
'What a newbie.'

63
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:08,450
You okay?

64
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:13,455
You should tell the dorm advisor about this.

65
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,456
Mind your own business.

66
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,444
Hmm!

67
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,434
Come on, Jake. They're closing.

68
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,457
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,476
- 'Help!' - I'm at school.

70
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,488
Better come quick, assuming you can remember

71
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:14,504
which school it is.

72
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,514
No. Please.

73
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:29,503
Don't worry.

74
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:32,530
I'm only going to make you into more of a party animal.

75
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,498
Ooh, wh-what are you doing?

76
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,540
'Oh, you'll see.'

77
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:43,545
'Hold it.'

78
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,523
He's gone now. It's okay.

79
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:00,548
- Ugh! - Or not.

80
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,535
I did it!

81
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,533
Then we better get out of here, quick!

82
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:10,565
'What's the rush?'

83
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:14,576
Come on!

84
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:32,594
Whirr.

85
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,617
- Hey, we got a problem. - No kidding.

86
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:17,640
Oh! Aah!

87
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:25,631
Come on. I've seen this movie before.

88
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:35,625
Huh! Okay. What's the plan?

89
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,654
- Move! - Good plan.

90
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,630
This is where we call in the Justice League, right?

91
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:52,663
For a monkey? They'd throw me out in two seconds.

92
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:58,655
So, how did you do on the test?

93
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,682
Uh! Aah!

94
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,684
- Langstrom. - Huh!

95
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,692
There was another creature attack tonight. An ape.

96
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,686
This is a blood sample I took from him.

97
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,689
'If you're serious about wanting to help'

98
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,691
'see if you can come up with an antidote.'

99
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:44,727
I'll get to work on it.

100
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,710
There are probably some mutagens in here that..

101
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:55,712
'Before they took him away'

102
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,739
'police questioned the so-called gorilla boy'

103
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,710
'but got few answers.'

104
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,702
Frankly, we don't know what's been causing this.

105
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,928
As of this point, we're ready to call in animal control.

106
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,715
Ha. Looks like you've got this room all to yourself now.

107
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,733
What a coincidence.

108
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,713
Hey. What are you laughing at?

109
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,728
Jake's in the hospital now. It's not funny.

110
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,722
Boo-hoo.

111
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,721
You saw what a jerk he was.

112
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,727
Doesn't mean he deserved that.

113
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,734
People tend to get exactly what they deserve, sunshine.

114
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:26,769
Maybe you will, too.

115
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,763
I think I know who the next monkey's gonna be.

116
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,750
'Shh! Quiet, Amber.'

117
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:49,754
'We go now live'

118
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:50,763
'to Gotham University President'

119
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,750
'Dr. Stephen Phillips.'

120
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:53,771
After last night's incident

121
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:56,765
I'm calling for all Gotham University students

122
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,774
to have DNA tests that will determine

123
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:01,766
who's been abusing mutagenic chemicals.

124
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,767
Tests will begin tomorrow morning.

125
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,776
He can't do that!

126
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,770
Isn't that, like, invasion of primacy?

127
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,774
Privacy. And it's not legal. No way!

128
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:13,782
But what if everyone else takes the test, and we don't?

129
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:16,811
- 'They'd know it was us!' - Hmm.

130
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,782
David?

131
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:23,798
What if everyone had the mutagen in their systems?

132
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,801
What are you talking about?

133
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:28,805
Well, I've always said this place was a zoo.

134
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,814
What if it really turned into one?

135
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,819
- Where you been? - Langstrom's lab.

136
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,824
He put together an antidote to the mutagen.

137
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,850
Good, 'cause we're gonna need it soon.

138
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,809
You sure?

139
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,839
'Give me a second.'

140
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:55,825
I'm sure.

141
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:56,828
Because unless the university's

142
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:57,830
stuffing their dorm pillows

143
00:13:57,854 --> 00:13:58,861
with vulture feathers.

144
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,851
I found our bird girl and her two friends.

145
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,827
- Where's everybody going? - Big football game tonight.

146
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:10,837
The dorm's so empty, we could probably

147
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:11,843
walk through the front door.

148
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,864
But where's the fun in that?

149
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:22,861
Think they're at the game?

150
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:25,858
They're not the school spirit types.

151
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,852
What type are they?

152
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,868
The type no one notices until it's too late.

153
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:31,894
Misfits.

154
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,874
Everyone fits in somewhere.

155
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,898
The hard part is finding the right place.

156
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:44,893
'Blueprints? For what?'

157
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:50,870
What are you saving it for? Put it all in.

158
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:53,871
I want everybody to get their share.

159
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:54,880
What was that?

160
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:57,882
Must be the kick-off. Our timing's perfect.

161
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:58,913
Get the detonator.

162
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,898
What?

163
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:01,900
We got visitors.

164
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:03,891
Batman and Batgirl.

165
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:05,925
I don't believe it! Better get up here.

166
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,942
- 'Nice poochie.' - Lab animals.

167
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,954
Time for the antidote.

168
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,973
She's got the antidote!

169
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,978
Boom.

170
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:39,998
You know, you were a real inspiration to me, Batman.

171
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:41,998
I was an inspiration to you?

172
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:45,026
When I was a kid, I saw you way up on a skyscraper.

173
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,286
You had everything I ever wanted.

174
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,990
Power, freedom, no one to answer to.

175
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:52,995
And then, there was the whole animal thing, too.

176
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,011
You might have seen me, but you sure didn't understand.

177
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,999
Well, I understand now.

178
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:01,009
You're a sell-out, a flunkie for the cops. That's all.

179
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:04,028
And you've turned yourself into a cheap circus act.

180
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:08,011
Not helping.

181
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:10,021
You want to talk about a circus?

182
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:12,013
Pretty soon, I'm going to turn the stadium

183
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:15,053
into the world's biggest freak show, thanks to this.

184
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,043
'But you're not gonna live to see it.'

185
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:43,042
'And now, for your halftime pleasure'

186
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:46,080
'the Gotham University marching band!'

187
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:51,093
Go, Gotham!

188
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,071
Go..

189
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,080
Gotham?

190
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,090
Shower's over.

191
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,074
Once this goes off, a cloud of mutagen

192
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:15,102
will cover half the campus.

193
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,109
Get back.

194
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,136
All set.

195
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,129
Hiss.

196
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,144
What?

197
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:16,174
Hiss

198
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,176
thud

199
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,185
clang.

200
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,173
No!

201
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:50,191
Whirr Ah! Ugh!

202
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,215
Uh-oh.

203
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:43,254
Thud.

204
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,248
- You okay? - Yeah.

205
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:54,243
'What's gonna happen to him and the other two now?'

206
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,250
Hard to say, but I have a feeling

207
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:58,241
<i>that wherever they end up</i>

208
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:01,260
<i>they're still gonna have trouble fitting in.</i>
