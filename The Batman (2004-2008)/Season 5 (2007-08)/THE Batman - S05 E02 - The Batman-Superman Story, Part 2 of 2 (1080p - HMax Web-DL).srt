1
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:16,068
It's far too quiet.

2
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:18,069
Superman's not exactly Mr. Yappy.

3
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:21,070
Maybe he's already tossed Luthor in jail and left for Metropolis.

4
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:24,064
We would have heard over the police band.

5
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:27,094
Something's not right. We need a closer look.

6
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:39,122
Click click.

7
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,096
Lukewarm. Luthor hasn't been gone long.

8
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,090
Everything's so neat and clean.

9
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:45,315
You'd think Alfred lived here.

10
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,104
You still at it?

11
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:07,126
You really are a creature of the night.

12
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,135
I found some residue in Luthor's test tube.

13
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,128
Porphyrin rings with a magnesium center.

14
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:15,132
Uh, middle school?

15
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:17,126
- Chlorophyll. - Chlorophyll?

16
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,131
You mean plants?

17
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,135
Yes. Maybe poison plants.

18
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,138
If Ivy's involved, we might have to take precautions.

19
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,144
- Suit up. - Where are we going?

20
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:27,145
Luthor's weapons lab here in town.

21
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,145
Lucius tells me they've been working overtime

22
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,139
away from prying eyes.

23
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:33,157
And X-ray eyes, too.

24
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,169
You with me, Robin?

25
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:57,200
Got your back.

26
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,202
Whirr.

27
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,190
'And <i>you, keep</i> the north entrance covered.'

28
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:18,199
No one gets in.

29
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,231
Whirr

30
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,235
click.

31
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,215
How are we doing, Mercy?

32
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,214
All systems are go, Lex.

33
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:56,229
We even have perfect weather.

34
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,261
Then let's get them activated.

35
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,246
Beep beep.

36
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:28,279
Let me out. Let me out!

37
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,289
Thud thud

38
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,305
crash

39
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:51,310
bang.

40
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:58,285
I injected a flash dehydrate made especially

41
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,280
for you, Clayface.

42
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:03,309
Crumble crumble crumble.

43
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,329
You'll be okay. Just add water.

44
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,329
Looking for someone?

45
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,331
Snap.

46
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,347
Ivy's mind control spores laced with Kryptonite.

47
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,318
So you are as clever as they say.

48
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,313
He was a little resistant last night

49
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:32,325
so I thought I'd give him an extended dose.

50
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:36,322
- What are you up to, Luthor? - Saving the world, Batman.

51
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:39,330
You saw how helpless it was during the alien invasion.

52
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,330
We have no central control, no plan of attack.

53
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,367
Instead we put our faith in aliens.

54
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,334
Well, no more.

55
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,327
Only humans should be in charge of Earth's destiny.

56
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,343
Humans with robots.

57
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,344
Oh, they're more than just robots, Batman.

58
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:57,353
'They're powerful, aerial, wireless transmitters.'

59
00:05:57,377 --> 00:06:00,340
<i>Once aloft, they'll target the most strategic</i>

60
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:02,350
<i>military installations in the world</i>

61
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:03,655
<i>at which point, they'll interface</i>

62
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,374
<i>with the defense systems on the ground..</i>

63
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,360
<i>Giving me complete control.</i>

64
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:11,372
Whirr.

65
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,396
<i>I don't expect everyone to understand</i>

66
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,357
<i>what I'm doing at first but in the end</i>

67
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,371
<i>we'll have a single worldwide army.</i>

68
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:25,364
<i>One that will ensure protection against aliens.</i>

69
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,410
No one will dominate the Earth again.

70
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,376
Except for you.

71
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,377
Well, someone has to be in charge

72
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,374
and who could stop me except for Superman?

73
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:38,381
And he may turn out to be the most valuable robot of all.

74
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:39,418
Destroy him.

75
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,419
Clang clang crackle

76
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,425
boom.

77
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,396
Find him!

78
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,426
Break him!

79
00:06:58,423 --> 00:06:59,434
Whack

80
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,429
creak.

81
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,422
Robin, can you hear me? We have a problem.

82
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:14,435
Crash.

83
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:16,458
You're not kiddin'.

84
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,476
Click

85
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,488
pow Aah!

86
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,485
Oh, no.

87
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:54,484
Swoosh.

88
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,463
Gotcha!

89
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:02,477
See? Nothing to it.

90
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,498
Look, up in the sky!

91
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,509
Crash.

92
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,510
- Awesome! - Awesome!

93
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,498
Hey, superdude, you okay?

94
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,497
Whoa. Check out the blingbling.

95
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,490
Hello? That's Kryptonite.

96
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,502
Oh, ho, what do we do, man?

97
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,532
Uh, kick it in the water.

98
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,532
Splash.

99
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,519
Alright, superdude!

100
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:45,521
Give me five! Yeah!

101
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,515
- Ooh, hoo! Cool! - Yeah!

102
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,550
- Rock it, man! - Oh, that was gnarly, dude.

103
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:56,516
Whoosh What are we here for?

104
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,549
Insurance.

105
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:01,547
Beep beep beep

106
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:06,554
fiss.

107
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,540
So that's where you got the Kryptonite from.

108
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:11,536
I thought you gave it to Superman.

109
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,534
It was a fake, I decided to hang on

110
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:14,639
to the real thing in case..

111
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,580
Clang ...that.

112
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:25,587
Clang

113
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,572
clang clang crash.

114
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,593
Argh!

115
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,597
He's gonna blow!

116
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:47,605
Clang.

117
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,601
Uh! Ugh!

118
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,612
I got it!

119
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,603
Whoa!

120
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,625
Crash

121
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,623
creak

122
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,626
whirr.

123
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,620
When he gets out, he's not gonna be happy.

124
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,612
Whack I have an idea how to stop him

125
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,637
but I've got to get him out of here.

126
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:39,628
What do I do?

127
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:41,646
Maybe you can slow him down.

128
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:54,669
Swoosh.

129
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,677
Got him, Batman!

130
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,690
Ah!

131
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,673
'No one knows why they're fighting, folks'

132
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,694
'but it looks like a clash of titans from up here.'

133
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:33,690
Should we delay the countdown?

134
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:35,677
Not on your life.

135
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:36,686
No man in a tin can

136
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,683
is going to beat the Man Of Steel.

137
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:39,698
And if their battle distracts the city

138
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,689
so much the better.

139
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,718
We proceed as scheduled.

140
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:46,722
Clang

141
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:51,717
swoosh

142
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,724

143
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:15,740
thud thud thud crash

144
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,750

145
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,748
crackle crackle.

146
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,771
'Hey, blue boy.'

147
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:46,767
thud thud Cool.

148
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:51,786
You get a raise.

149
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:55,754
I get paid?

150
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:56,789
Come on.

151
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,770
Ew. Is this where you were leading him?

152
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:07,769
What are you going to do, stink him into submission?

153
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:08,806
Something like that.

154
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,796
Here we are.

155
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,799
Crash.

156
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,805
Put on your mask.

157
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:23,809
Creak fiss.

158
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,823
Uh! Ah!

159
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:37,835
Aa-argh!

160
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,829
Creak creak creak.

161
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,859
- Wha-what's going on? - That cured him?

162
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,817
Luthor had you under the spell of Poison Ivy's

163
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,830
mind-controlling plant spores.

164
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:02,830
But I just doused you with atrazine

165
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,829
a basic component of plant killers.

166
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:05,842
It wiped out the spores.

167
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,832
I owe you one.

168
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,841
It wasn't just me.

169
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,867
I guess teamwork does have its advantages.

170
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,063
Thirty seconds to launch, Lex.

171
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,839
You should pay attention, Ms. Ivy.

172
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:21,852
History is being made

173
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:24,847
and you provided the seeds of change.

174
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:27,873
Opening silo. Ten seconds to liftoff.

175
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:33,893
Whirr

176
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,892
whoosh.

177
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:43,902
I'll handle those. See if you can stop them from the inside.

178
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,896
Zap zap zap Aah!

179
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,910
Zap zap zap

180
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,912
buzz buzz buzz clang.

181
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,919
No! They have to take him out!

182
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:20,920
Zap zap zap whack zap zap zap

183
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,939
I'll put them all on him.

184
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:26,943
Clang clang clang.

185
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,930
Might want to cover your ears.

186
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:32,955
Boom

187
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:43,966
bang bang.

188
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:47,959
Keep on them.

189
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,963
Zap zap zap

190
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:04,983
swoosh swoosh swoosh

191
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,973
boom boom boom

192
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,993
whack

193
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:20,994
crash

194
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:28,005
boom boom

195
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,011
thunk

196
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,017
boom

197
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:44,023
zap zap zap

198
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:55,026
bang

199
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,024
whirr.

200
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:13,049
Lex, what about me? Uh! Uh!

201
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:24,063
That must be the daddy.

202
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,070
Whoosh.

203
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,065
Move!

204
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,068
Whoosh.

205
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:53,064
'Two seconds to hyperdrive.'

206
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:57,057
'Program failure. Command terminated.'

207
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:58,074
What?

208
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:00,077
'Warning. Warning.'

209
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,072
'Virus detected.'

210
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,085
'Warning.'

211
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,102
Uh!

212
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:13,112
Clang

213
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,096
smash

214
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,104
boom.

215
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,138
You can't leave without saying goodbye.

216
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,128
Fiss.

217
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,123
- 'Morning.' - 'Is that when it is?'

218
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,112
Who can tell up here?

219
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:51,125
Have you seen today's headlines?

220
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:53,115
Been a little busy, Dick.

221
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,113
The Lex has been tossed in jail with Ivy and the others.

222
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,126
'Who says there's no good news?'

223
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,130
Hey, if you need some help up there, I could..

224
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:02,162
No, thanks. I've got a visitor. Out.

225
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:09,142
So, this is what all the excitement is about.

226
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,130
Still a work in progress, but it'll do for now.

227
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,144
I asked you here because I wanted to give you this

228
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:16,150
the real Kryptonite.

229
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:18,140
I dug it up from my lab.

230
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:20,162
Found the piece in the river, too.

231
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,154
You keep it.

232
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:28,174
At least then I'll know it's with someone who's on my side.

233
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,195
Now, tell me about this justice team of yours.

234
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,197
League. Justice league.

235
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,169
Told the Martian it sounded like a ball club.

236
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:41,160
Anyway, this is our command center.

237
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,175
Someone's always stationed here.

238
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,203
It's time-consuming, but the view's great.
