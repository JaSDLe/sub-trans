00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:09,011
Caw caw

2
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,055
splash

3
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,053
clang clang clang

4
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:54,060
clank.

5
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:09,065
Alright, we lay low until the heat's off.

6
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:12,053
Then we move the rocks. Clear?

7
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:16,057
- Crystal. - Um, speaking of heat..

8
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:17,098
Oh, man. Is that the Bat?

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,094
Thud.

10
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:29,087
Boys, I'm a whole different breed of animal.

11
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:32,096
And one butt-ugly hood ornament.

12
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:37,093
Looks like you had a busy night. That's good.

13
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:39,121
Cause you're all working for me now.

14
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:44,085
Gentlemen, show the walking freak show

15
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,107
who's boss around here.

16
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:55,125
You city boys need to learn yourself some manners.

17
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:59,115
- Who are you? - Name's Croc.

18
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:03,141
Killer Croc. But you can call me boss.

19
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,190
♪ The Batman ♪

20
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,193
Gotham has a sudden burst of nine

21
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,215
seemingly unrelated heists.

22
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:24,184
With stolen goods ranging from explosives to jet skis.

23
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,222
There has to be a link between these crimes.

24
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,191
Huh?

25
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,189
Apologies, Master Bruce.

26
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,213
Just a bit of spring cleaning.

27
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,217
Clang

28
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,228
beep.

29
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:43,219
Uh, Alfred, where are you taking the evidence?

30
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,208
These cases are closed.

31
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:48,218
They are now history in every sense of the word.

32
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:50,225
It would be criminal to <i>not preserve</i>

33
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:52,217
these items for posterity.

34
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,228
So I've chosen to archive them.

35
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:56,258
A private museum, if you will.

36
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,232
After all, the Batman may someday enjoy

37
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,232
a more favorable place in society's view.

38
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:05,250
Yeah, I won't hold my breath.

39
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,236
Water.

40
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,244
Actually, I'd prefer a spot of ice tea

41
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:13,231
if you're headed to the kitchen.

42
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,244
No, the link between the robberies, water.

43
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:19,241
A half dozen within spitting distance of a canal

44
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,266
'and three on Gotham Bay.'

45
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,288
thud.

46
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,306
Boss wants this swag loaded. <i>Pronto!</i>

47
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,300
The Batman.

48
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:14,328
I'd like to have a word with this boss you fellas mentioned.

49
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,337
Clank.

50
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:49,346
My daddy used to say you want something done right

51
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,374
best to do it yourself.

52
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,369
Clank swoosh

53
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,370
swoosh swoosh

54
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:07,388
crash.

55
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:16,357
You look to be this Batman legend I keep hearin' about.

56
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:17,370
Well, folks are gonna start hearin' about

57
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:20,393
how Killer Croc stopped you good.

58
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,419
Bam grrr

59
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,421
splash

60
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,436
thud

61
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:14,454
clank.

62
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,467
Boss Croc definitely does not have both oars in the water.

63
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,492
Yeah, he calls this slime pit headquarters.

64
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,462
Well, maybe you two should mention that to Croc.

65
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:05,499
Me, I like my teeth just where they are.

66
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,931
Yeah, well, first chance I get, it's after a while, crocodile.

67
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:16,518
Sure do hate to see my boys so unhappy.

68
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,488
Oh, not me, boss, I'm happy... as a clam.

69
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:23,491
Good, because this time tomorrow

70
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,503
the tops of skyscrapers will be our lily pads.

71
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:30,522
And downtown Gotham will be our oyster.

72
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,546
Master Bruce, your Batsuit may be drip-dry

73
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,548
you, however, are not.

74
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:50,514
Next time, I'll be sure to keep Croc on my turf.

75
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:51,526
Dry land.

76
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,555
Beep beep beep.

77
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,523
This was the scene moments ago

78
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,519
as Gotham's financial district was hit

79
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,561
'by the largest flood in the city's history.'

80
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,555
thud thud.

81
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:04,562
What?

82
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,530
'Emergency crews are now'

83
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:08,542
'arriving on the scene to assist'

84
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,540
'with the evacuation of local residents.'

85
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,566
'The cause of the flood is still unknown.'

86
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,577
beep beep beep.

87
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:23,562
'Three bank alarms in Gotham's waterlogged financial district?'

88
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:26,579
Your amphibious acquaintance?

89
00:09:57,618 --> 00:10:02,611
Water, water everywhere!

90
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:20,633
How about a little game of chicken? Cajun style.

91
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,676
Splash Mind your cowl now.

92
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:22,662
Croc's story, spill it.

93
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:26,676
He's ex-military, I think. Mercenary type.

94
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,682
Some think he's a genetic experiment.

95
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,682
A cross-breed soldier or something.

96
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:31,688
Others think he messed with

97
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,687
the wrong kind of voodoo in the bayou.

98
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:35,689
Me, I'm thinking circus freak.

99
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,719
Facts, not folk tales.

100
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,697
What's to tell? Croc's new in town, he's got big plans.

101
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,687
Bigger than robbing banks?

102
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:47,710
Uh... Croc said today's flood was just a dry run.

103
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:51,705
If I wanted to do some big city Croc hunting

104
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,691
where would I go?

105
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,694
Oh, no way.

106
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,701
Boss Croc's cold-blooded, man.

107
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:58,846
I talk, I wind up fish food.

108
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,726
You don't talk, we could <i>all</i> wind up fish food.

109
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,753
Splash.

110
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:49,761
Schematics of Gotham's canals.

111
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:52,764
'You sure got a lot of bloodhound in ya'

112
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:57,755
for a bat. What do you think?

113
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,764
A dry little spot to catch my breath between heists.

114
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,149
And right beside the overflow pumps

115
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,774
for Gotham's canal system.

116
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:06,772
They were designed to drain the canals

117
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,767
into the bay in case of flooding.

118
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,784
But I did some thinking.

119
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:12,781
If you reverse the pumps..

120
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:15,793
They draw water <i>in from</i> the bay <i>filling the canals</i>

121
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,796
until they submerge any part of Gotham

122
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,790
situated below sea level.

123
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:22,782
Just about all of downtown

124
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,787
where the good shopping is.

125
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:26,799
Tens of thousands of lives could be lost.

126
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,804
And I'll shed a crocodile tear

127
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:31,819
for each and every one.

128
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:38,841
Swish swish

129
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,827
swish

130
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:42,845
splash.

131
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:47,814
And speaking of..

132
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:50,853
My pets haven't had a decent bite since we arrived.

133
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,820
Now, if you'll pardon me, bat snack

134
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,860
I've got some more pumps to reverse.

135
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,876
Clank clank clank

136
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,863

137
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,875
beep beep beep boom

138
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,894
beep beep beep hiss hiss hiss.

139
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:46,887
Nothing like good old elbow grease.

140
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:54,902
Rumble rumble.

141
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:02,894
Huh? You are peskier than a fly in a..

142
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,910
Thud

143
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:06,924

144
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,913
swish swish swish.

145
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:13,922
Catch of the day.

146
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,937
Splash.

147
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:46,947
You gotta put your back into it, boy.

148
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:50,967
Splash.

149
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:18,958
You best give it up, Bat.

150
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:20,969
By the time they figure out what caused the flood

151
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:24,988
downtown Gotham will be my personal swamp.

152
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,001
Thud

153
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,010
splat

154
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,021
splash

155
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,030
bam

156
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:16,035
thud splash.

157
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:43,073
Boy, you are beginning to stick in my craw.

158
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,098
A dry little spot to catch my breath between heists.

159
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:26,108
Your amphibious acquaintance?

160
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,109
Clank

161
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,114
thud

162
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,136
clank

163
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,135
thud.

164
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,177
'Crocs may like water, but they're no fish.'

165
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,158
So, either of you up for giving lizard-lips

166
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:22,173
a little mouth-to-mouth?

167
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,186
Huh, didn't think so.

168
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,200
What are you looking at?

169
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,185
This ain't over, Aqua Bat.

170
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:56,176
