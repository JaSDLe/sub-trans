1
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,012
Trick or treat?

2
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:37,035
My, what wonderful costumes, Virginia.

3
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:40,034
Yes, they certainly are, Georgia.

4
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:44,023
But what are you doing trick-or-treating? Hmm?

5
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,039
Hello. It's Halloween.

6
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:48,037
Not just any Halloween.

7
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,049
Tonight is Grundy's night.

8
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:54,035
'There, the swampland.'

9
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,054
'The birthplace of Solomon Grundy.'

10
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:02,043
<i>It was 150 years ago, on this very night</i>

11
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,061
<i>in that very same swamp</i>

12
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:07,056
<i>that a monster rose from the muck</i>

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,064
<i>and slouched toward Gotham</i>

14
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:15,096
<i>to wreak havoc against the very architects of our city.</i>

15
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,072
But the lives Grundy ruined that fateful night

16
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,080
weren't enough to satisfy him.

17
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:28,078
Grundy vowed to haunt the descendants of his victims

18
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:32,077
by returning on the darkest of all Hallows Eves.

19
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:36,088
Tonight, during a total lunar eclipse.

20
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:39,111
'Grundy will rise again.'

21
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:43,101
How do you know so much about this?

22
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:47,103
Because we are the granddaughters of Emmet Bolton

23
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:49,093
one of Grundy's victims.

24
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:52,106
And Grundy could come for us at any moment.

25
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,125
- Let's get out of here. - Let's get out of here.

26
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,133
Don't you want any candy?

27
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,115
To grandfather Emmet

28
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,118
who left us so much money.

29
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:17,139
And wonderful stories to scare children with.

30
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:39,178
- Aah! - Aah!

31
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:44,185
Destroy!

32
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:44,225
♪ The Batman ♪

33
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:10,327
Destroy!

34
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:15,298
- Trick or treat! - Trick or treat!

35
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:18,322
Sorry if I scared you, Holmes.

36
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:22,305
It's Grundy's night, you know?

37
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,330
I am well aware.

38
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,319
Any good costumes this round?

39
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:39,335
If you consider Joker, Catwoman, and Penguin good.

40
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:43,336
I guess it's more fun to be the bad guys.

41
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,326
You sure you didn't see a ghost, Alfred?

42
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,338
I was a bit spooked by the chaperone's Solomon Grundy mask.

43
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:53,345
Well, it is Grundy's night.

44
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:57,341
Not all legends are legend, Master Bruce.

45
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,686
The Batman's faced a lot of things

46
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,343
that go bump in the night, Alfred.

47
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,380
But swamp zombies?

48
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:06,359
The Batwave.

49
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:10,353
Oh, it would appear something has gone bump, sir.

50
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:13,391
What would Halloween be if I didn't get to wear my costume?

51
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:38,384
What happened here?

52
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:39,392
Ahh, a vampire.

53
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,392
T-t-the police will be here any moment.

54
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,385
I'm here to help you, not harm you.

55
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,396
Who or what did this?

56
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,397
It was him. He came for us.

57
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,433
Solomon Grundy.

58
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,399
Look how strong he is.

59
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:58,399
He did this with his bare hands.

60
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:01,402
All part of his revenge

61
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:03,406
just as the legend told.

62
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,408
Grundy would return on darkest night..

63
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:10,408
To deprive the descendants of all in their sight.

64
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,416
Our home, our assets.

65
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,414
We're fortunate we still have our lives.

66
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:18,428
Revenge. Ladies, I know you're frightened, but...

67
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:21,449
If you don't believe us, look.

68
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:26,455
He came for us. He'll come for the others, too.

69
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,465
Who are these others?

70
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:50,478
No.

71
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,486
Winslow, run.

72
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:03,463
Grundy must have his revenge.

73
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:05,490
Grundy must destroy.

74
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:09,490
Ugh!

75
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,524
Destroy.

76
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,555
Yah!

77
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,578
Grundy wins.

78
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,605
Ohh... ahh..

79
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,608
Whoa!

80
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,610
Huh?

81
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:01,619
No candy here, fellas.

82
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,609
My home, everything I own, gone.

83
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,633
Spiffy costume.

84
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:42,629
Boo.

85
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:46,625
Ah. Sir, what happened to you?

86
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,658
Your Gotham legend happened.

87
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,674
Solomon Grundy?

88
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,661
There was a resemblance.

89
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,658
Your bruises didn't make themselves, Master Bruce.

90
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:02,643
'Was your attacker a seven and a half foot tall'

91
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,652
swamp zombie or wasn't he?

92
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:05,660
I just don't wanna have to believe

93
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:07,655
in the boogeyman, too, Alfred.

94
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,650
You would be wise to listen closely, sir.

95
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:14,672
The legend may provide a clue to lifting Grundy's curse.

96
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:19,686
It says here that Gotham swamp wasn't always a swamp.

97
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:21,675
<i>Once, it was lake</i>

98
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:24,670
<i>home to the mostly Eastern European laborers</i>

99
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:25,707
<i>who built Gotham city.</i>

100
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,677
<i>But three businessmen, Bolton, Winslow and Parish</i>

101
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,675
<i>conspired to make the area a dumping ground</i>

102
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:33,684
<i>for the industrial waste</i>

103
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,718
<i>created by Gotham's construction</i>

104
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,682
<i>turning the lake into Gotham swamp</i>

105
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:42,682
<i>rendering the area unsuitable for habitation.</i>

106
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:44,683
<i>Several of the laborers who lost their homes</i>

107
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:47,700
<i>were versed in magic from their native countries.</i>

108
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,703
<i>On all Hallows Eve, during a lunar eclipse</i>

109
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:53,706
<i>they used that magic to form Solomon Grundy</i>

110
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,698
<i>from the very waste of Gotham swamp.</i>

111
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,706
<i>Since the laborers and their families</i>

112
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,704
<i>lost everything they owned</i>

113
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:04,708
<i>so, too, would Grundy haunt Gotham's founding fathers</i>

114
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,720
<i>and their families, through the years</i>

115
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,745
<i>leaving them destitute.</i>

116
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:16,720
Oh, poetic justice it is most spine-tingling.

117
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:17,747
'Sir?'

118
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:28,744
I see you have no patience for old butler's tales.

119
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:29,747
Not true, Alfred.

120
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,741
But tonight I'll let science

121
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:34,749
dictate what is and isn't supernatural.

122
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:37,735
'I'm looking for a follicle, a sliver of dead skin'

123
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,743
anything in this mud that might contain a trace of Grundy's DNA.

124
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:43,761
Call me when the results are in.

125
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,764
And you will be where?

126
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:47,753
It's nearly witching hour.

127
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:49,758
If Grundy's allowed to strike his last victim

128
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,759
he could disappear for another 150 years.

129
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:54,779
Do hurry back, sir.

130
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,785
We wouldn't want you turning into a pumpkin.

131
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,789
Hey, goodnight, Mr. Parish.

132
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:19,822
Happy Halloween.

133
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,828
Gotham's oldest attraction

134
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,825
and Halloween night, its biggest money-maker.

135
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:47,844
Pretty fast for a swamp zombie.

136
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,842
Waah!

137
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:07,839
Whoa there, buddy.

138
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,871
I'm just messin' with ya.

139
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,831
Hey, didn't see you at old man Parish's shindig.

140
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,850
That's quite a Batman costume you got there.

141
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:18,842
Listen, I'm looking for a... friend of mine.

142
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,850
Big guy, dressed like Solomon Grundy.

143
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:23,847
Hmm, haven't seen any swamp zombies

144
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:26,860
but if I do, I'll let 'em know the Batman's looking for 'em.

145
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:29,884
The Batman. Waah..

146
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,865
'Master Bruce.'

147
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:34,864
Go ahead.

148
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:37,862
The Batwave traced DNA alright

149
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,859
mutated human DNA.

150
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,875
'The odd thing is, it wasn't on any follicles or skin.'

151
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,875
But in the mud itself.

152
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,884
How on Earth could you possibly have known that?

153
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:50,868
Grundy may not be supernatural

154
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:53,899
but his threat is real alright.

155
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,901
Grundy will destroy you.

156
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:06,922
Argh!

157
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,925
Raaahhh!

158
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:20,902
Revenge.

159
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,913
Halloween's nearly over, Grundy.

160
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,934
Time to lose the mask.

161
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:32,913
Trick or treat, Clayface.

162
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,914
Can't blame me for having some Halloween fun

163
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,931
can ya, Bats?

164
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,920
Terrorizing the descendants

165
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,924
and destroying their homes was your cover

166
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:43,938
but it was their money you were after.

167
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:47,929
Leave 'em destitute, like the legend says.

168
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,943
Raahhh!

169
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,938
No one would think of chasing after Grundy for the money.

170
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:55,945
They'd have to dredge Gotham swamp.

171
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,948
And I'd be long gone with my loot

172
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:02,958
taking any face I wanted, alive, dead, or nonexistent.

173
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,956
I knew I couldn't lose a 500-pound zombie that easily.

174
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,961
I may not have tricked you, Bats

175
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,989
but I'm still gonna collect my treats.

176
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:32,977
'A shapeshifter in a wax museum.'

177
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,012
Great.

178
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,022
Grundy. Too obvious.

179
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:13,037
My leg.

180
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:21,046
Sorry, Bats. I'm the one providing the chills tonight.

181
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:23,060
Clang.

182
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:31,097
The problem with this mask, Bats..

183
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:33,128
No air holes.

184
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,119
Aah!

185
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,134
Thud.

186
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,135
'Try and find me, Batman.'

187
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,130
'I'm just another face in the crowd.'

188
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,143
Oh, you win the door prize

189
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,155
the waxworks hot wax special.

190
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:23,185
Face it, Bats.

191
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,171
You'll be the most realistic dummy in the place.

192
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,192
No!

193
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:01,196
Oh, another all Hallows Eve come and gone.

194
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,226
Well, at least Grundy's curse is lifted.

195
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,191
What makes you so certain, sir?

196
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,213
You're kidding, right?

197
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:14,235
Just because an arch-villain masqueraded as Grundy tonight

198
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,230
does not mean the zombie doesn't exist.

199
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:20,242
'Well, what can I say, Alfred?'

200
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,236
'You make a compelling argument.'

201
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,212
If there was a Grundy, we'd have seen him by now.

202
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,229
Yeah. Those old ladies were kooks.

203
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:37,256
Let's bail.

204
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:44,221
It's Grundy.

205
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,258
Run!

206
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:23,288
