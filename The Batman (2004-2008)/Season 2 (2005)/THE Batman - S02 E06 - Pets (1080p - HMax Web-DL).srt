What took you so long?

25
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:22,191
Hoo hoo hoo You are late! Again!

26
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,195
Caw.

27
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,204
Zip it! I'm through with you birdbrains.

28
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:28,229
You are not wise enough!

29
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,197
You eat too much meat!

30
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,209
You are always crowing about something or other.

31
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,200
And you, Finch!

32
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:39,212
Don't get me started on you and your bird pies!

33
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:44,205
Splat Ohh! Indoors?

34
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,210
Bleh-achk!

35
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,211
I have had it with you slobs!

36
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:51,220
Well, you and your doo-doo are going the way of the dodo.

37
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:54,249
So, say hello to your replacement!

38
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,259
Raaawwwk.

39
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,222
A rare condor

40
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:04,229
so vicious even I can't train it.

41
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:07,240
But with this specialized sonic thingy

42
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:12,238
I can command any bird to do my bidding.

43
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:16,264
Clang Observe.

44
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:21,239
I am your master.

45
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:23,268
Come to me.

46
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:29,278
Hmm. Come to me-e-e!

47
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,258
Come... to... me.

48
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:38,268
'I am your master.'

49
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,260
'Come to me!'

50
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:43,270
'Come to me-e-e.'

51
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:44,307
'Come to me!'

52
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,276
'You'll see.'

53
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,269
It's a matter of time before I recreate my formula

54
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,291
which will allow me to once again

55
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:57,303
rule Gotham's night skies as Man-Bat!

56
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:04,283
Okay. Do you want these chimichangas or not, Langstrom?

57
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:06,294
'Come to me!'

58
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:09,323
'Come to-o me-e!'

59
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:12,329
Aaaaaah!

60
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,304
The noise!

61
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,300
Aaaaah!

62
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:19,310
What noise?

63
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,305
Yaah-aah-aah!

64
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,301
Turn it off! Please!

65
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,338
Get it out of my head!

66
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,355
Screech Aah!

67
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:40,327
Grr..

68
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,324
Raaaarrh!

69
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:45,350
'Come to me-e-e!'

70
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:48,351
crash.

71
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:54,364
I said come to me already!

72
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:58,357
Rawwwkk Aah!

73
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:01,383
Thud Alright! I'm sorry!

74
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:09,387
Clang Lousy hunk of junk!

75
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:15,383
Swoosh crash Raaaarrh!

76
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,398
Aah!

77
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:25,366
Who the, what are you?

78
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,410
And what do bats have against me anyway?

79
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:32,374
Get away, you!

80
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:34,374
'Get away!'

81
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:35,411
flap.

82
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:40,422
Get away?

83
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:44,404
Screech.

84
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,408
Come to me.

85
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,395
Fan me.

86
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,398
Raaarrh!

87
00:06:56,422 --> 00:07:00,427
I said, fan your master.

88
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,423
Pity this won't work on birdy.

89
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:10,427
I'll just have to make do with a ferocious

90
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:14,438
giant bat monster instead!

91
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:22,423
A flurry of moths, sir?

92
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,441
Penguin's pets.

93
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,432
Didn't have a shot at tracking them

94
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,425
to their master's whereabouts

95
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,440
but it doesn't add up.

96
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,445
'Oswald Cobblepot's always been after the big payday'

97
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,445
'jewels, gold, money..'

98
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:35,439
But a tech robbery?

99
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,438
Sonics?

100
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:39,441
Batwave.

101
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:42,449
An alarm has been tripped at Gotham National Bank.

102
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:45,467
Now that's the Penguin I know.

103
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,480
Screech.

104
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,478
Oh, dear.

105
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,477
Beep beep Intruder alert?

106
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:13,476
Evacuate the cave. I'm on my way.

107
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
'That will be most unnecessary, sir.'

108
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:22,503
I believe I can handle our masked intruder myself.

109
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:26,522
Blast!

110
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,521
Screech.

111
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,519
Either Penguin's been working out..

112
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:44,546
Or he needs a manicure.

113
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,527
Splat

114
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:49,534
thud.

115
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,520
Man-Bat.

116
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:56,530
Wouldn't a blood bank be more your style, Langstrom?

117
00:08:56,554 --> 00:09:04,562
Screech.

118
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,575
The money.

119
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,566
Bring me the money.

120
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,585
Screech.

121
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,567
'Score!'

122
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:48,605
Look! Superbat's proving you tweeters are for the birds!

123
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:54,584
Huh?

124
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:57,606
Flap flap flap

125
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:09,628
thud.

126
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:16,603
Stop fooling around!

127
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,641
'Get rid of the Batman!'

128
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:20,640
thud.

129
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:26,636
The Batman, not the money!

130
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:28,651
Swoosh

131
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:41,656
screech.

132
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,670
Down, boy.

133
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,656
Creak creak.

134
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,660
Since when does Man-Bat rob banks?

135
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:09,670
Since Penguin started stealing sonic technology.

136
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:21,681
Blast.

137
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,676
- Our intruder? - Uh, not to worry, sir.

138
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,714
My grip on that scoundrel tightens as we speak.

139
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,675
I'm on a wild animal hunt myself, Alfred.

140
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:36,694
And I have a hunch our bird heist

141
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,705
will shed some light on our bat heist.

142
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,688
Rest up, my giant bat pet.

143
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:53,700
More crimes to commit for El Penguino tomorrow.

144
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,705
Raah!

145
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,722
Screech.

146
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:09,716
You! You! Get out of my head!

147
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,725
Huh? Where's my bat pet?

148
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,730
I am no one's pet!

149
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:16,759
I'm Dr. Kirk Langstrom, scientist

150
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,761
<i>and one of the greatest</i> minds in Gotham.

151
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,766
No! I, Penguin am one of the greatest.

152
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,738
So that's the wretched device which controls me.

153
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,163
Its frequency must have triggered my

154
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,738
echolocation bat hearing

155
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,745
and reactivated dormant traces of the serum

156
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,767
in my system, transforming me into Man-Bat!

157
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:39,750
Yeah, whatever.

158
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:41,757
So I just gotta flip this puppy on

159
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:44,762
to turn nerd guy back into Man-Bat?

160
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:47,789
I shall allow you to live, Penguin

161
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,765
if you hand it to me now.

162
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:55,779
Hand what to ya, huh? This? This?

163
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:00,778
Then be sure you never lose it

164
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,772
for the first opportunity I get

165
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:05,801
I shall clip your flightless wings.

166
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,769
'I've repaired the device, Alfred.'

167
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,772
Diagnostics indicate it's a sonic emitter

168
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,779
encoded to communicate with birds.

169
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,791
But it can be adjusted to emit different frequencies.

170
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,798
'My guess is the one Penguin ended up with'

171
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:24,791
'was configured to control bats.'

172
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,786
Man-Bat may have the physical advantage

173
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,792
over the Batman, but if we can use

174
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:31,795
'this device to capture Penguin's frequency'

175
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:32,804
we might have a shot at breaking.

176
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:35,817
Penguin's spell over his slave.

177
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,798
Gad! That wretched creature

178
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:40,817
'made off with the bait.'

179
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,807
It may be time to use

180
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:47,819
Wayne Industries media connections to lay some bait.

181
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:51,830
' "Golden penguin statue?" Wow.'

182
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:55,829
Now, how could they bring something like that to Gotham

183
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:58,818
and not expect me to steal it?

184
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,842
Idiots!

185
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:06,835
'Hmm.'

186
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,860
And it's already boxed for takeout.

187
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:14,848
Click.

188
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,873
Penguin's about to take the bait, Alfred.

189
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:18,880
I await your signal, sir.

190
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,848
Alright, Fido..

191
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:29,857
Screech ...time to fetch.

192
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:31,876
Raaawk!

193
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:36,861
Alfred, I've captured Penguin's signal.

194
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:37,872
Got it, sir.

195
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,877
That wave is translating its frequency.

196
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:42,904
Whack whack.

197
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,890
'That's what I'm talkin' about!'

198
00:14:52,914 --> 00:14:55,917
Sinewy strands of monster muscle!

199
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,977
Could you do that, vulture?

200
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,884
'I didn't think so.'

201
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:01,916
cheep cheep cheep

202
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:06,894
screech Ah! Please don't break!

203
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:08,440
Please don't break, please don't break!

204
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,923
Screech thud.

205
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,901
Bowling balls?

206
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,927
It's a trick!

207
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:27,908
'So! You like pinatas, Batman?'

208
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:30,938
Let's find out what you're filled with.

209
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:34,937
'Man-Bat, attack!'

210
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:40,953
screech Standing by, Alfred.

211
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:44,934
Frequency transmission complete.

212
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,927
Prepare to receive, sir.

213
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,970
Clang screech.

214
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,970
Sir, can you hear me?

215
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:00,979
Blast!

216
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,947
Stop.

217
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:05,979
Stop!

218
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:15,984
Screech thud.

219
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:28,009
Alfred, do you copy?

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,997
Crackle crackle Hold on, Master Bruce.

221
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:43,025
No reception. I'm flying solo.

222
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,008
Gotta buy some time.

223
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:53,000
Pound him into bat guano.

224
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:55,017
Raaaarrh!

225
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:08,025
Thud screech.

226
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,010
How about a game of hide 'n seek?

227
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:14,056
Oh, the shadows won't conceal you, Batman.

228
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,018
My Man-Bat can hear in the dark.

229
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,061
Raaaarrh!

230
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,061
Smash

231
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,082
thud thud thud

232
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,088
bang bang.

233
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,088
Not too fond of confined spaces?

234
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:56,098
Screech screech screech.

235
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,102
Power? Where's the backup power?

236
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,069
How can one hungry ball of hair do so much damage?

237
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,080
Ah, these are terrible seats.

238
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:09,097
I'm missing all the fun.

239
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,107
Screech

240
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,101
boom

241
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:22,114
screech.

242
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:29,125
Almost... there.

243
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,139
Thud thud.

244
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,106
Raaaarrh!

245
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,139
Beep We have transmission!

246
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,124
Raaarrh!

247
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:55,153
Stop.

248
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:58,139
Phew!

249
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:04,159
You really did bring this upon yourself, you know.

250
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,168
And the champion returns.

251
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:14,151
So the mighty Batman is finally..

252
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:15,177
Whack.

253
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:19,145
Ooh, boy.

254
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:21,153
'Bring me Penguin..'

255
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:24,162
'...by whatever means necessary.'

256
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,187
Please! Help me!

257
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,182
Ow! Someone please!

258
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:39,194
Next time, Penguin, stick to birds.

259
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,184
Oh, hi, Dr. Langstrom.

260
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,192
Ow!

261
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:58,219
Now that Penguin and Langstrom are roosting

262
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,178
in Arkham where they belong

263
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:02,192
'we may want to think about installing'

264
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,225
'an anti-rodent barrier.'

265
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,207
'Nice mask.'

266
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:15,207
In case you were considering taking on a sidekick, sir.

267
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,197
I think Penguin and I

268
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:19,237
are through with pets for the time being.

269
