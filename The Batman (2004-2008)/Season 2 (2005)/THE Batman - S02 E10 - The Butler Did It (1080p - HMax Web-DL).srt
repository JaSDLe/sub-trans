1
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,053
'I saw what you did.'

2
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:54,047
You leave me no choice, Alfred.

3
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,054
You're fired.

4
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:58,069
Oh!

5
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,065
Chirp chirp

6
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:07,089
Alfred! Check it out.

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,270
All your work on the Upcoming Charity's made you famous.

8
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:17,059
Thank goodness it isn't a mug shot, Master Bruce.

9
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,070
Uh, say again?

10
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:22,089
Merely a frightful dream I've been having all night long.

11
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:28,107
Well, these aren't my pajamas!

12
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,106
That isn't my mud.

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,112
Tell me more about this dream.

14
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:32,169
♪ The Batman ♪

15
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:49,152
Uh, well, Master Bruce, as silly as it may seem

16
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:53,151
in the dream I was a... thief.

17
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,171
My father's heirloom.

18
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:57,196
I do fear the butler did it.

19
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,172
Let's go to instant replay.

20
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,204
Beep.

21
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,190
Remind me not to leave out any loose change.

22
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:24,199
I, I cannot remember where I went from there!

23
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:27,196
Sleepwalking, kleptomania and amnesia?

24
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,205
I surely require professional help!

25
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,234
There has to be an explanation, Alfred.

26
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,198
I doubt we'll be seeing

27
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:36,224
your mug shot in the paper anytime soon.

28
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:42,244
The Duncan, McCue and Wayne foundations

29
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,222
are only hosting the blind children's charity auction.

30
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:48,206
The real star of the event is a brilliant man

31
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,253
I had the honor of knowing during my travels abroad

32
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,217
the high priest of Sarkana.

33
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:54,227
'He's traveled all this way'

34
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,227
'to make a special donation to our cause'

35
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,249
'the famous Eye of Sarkana.'

36
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,239
And following the auction

37
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:05,231
my pad will be host to a rousing reception

38
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,255
in the holy man's honor.

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,251
Say cheese.

40
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,245
'Pardon the pun, McCue, but I heard'

41
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,252
'you were robbed blind last night.'

42
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,282
And the thief made off with a real painting.

43
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,259
Funny thing. There was no sign of a break-in.

44
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:27,251
The police seem to think it was some sort of..

45
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,274
'...inside job!'

46
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,261
It's my butler!

47
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:37,296
'Charles, where are you going?'

48
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,293
screech.

49
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,305
Uh, I'd better check on my butler.

50
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,302
That blasted vase must be here somewhere.

51
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:13,330
<i>Bring the valuables to me.</i>

52
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,361
Screech.

53
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,360
Alfred?

54
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,364
Now it's time for professional help.

55
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:05,371
'Sometimes, planting a homing device pays off.'

56
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:20,384
'Pull over!'

57
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,404
Okay, time to hitch a ride.

58
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,398
Thud.

59
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:36,405
Alfred, snap out of it.

60
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,398
Hypnosis.

61
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:43,403
Alfred, I command you to obey me.

62
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,436
Sorry.

63
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,425
Like clockwork.

64
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,462
'Actually..'

65
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,445
there was one hitch.

66
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,465
Now, you're a sight.

67
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,519
Get a grip. They're hallucinations.

68
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,522
Really vivid hallucinations.

69
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,525
Fool.

70
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,506
Attack!

71
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,541
Growl.

72
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,546
Finish him!

73
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:09,542
<i>Dreams must end upon waking</i>

74
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:13,562
but know you've disrupted nothing but a rehearsal.

75
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,586
The Batwave!

76
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,566
After stealing from you twice

77
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,578
and having a punch-up with The Batman

78
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:42,573
I should hope you'd have my head examined.

79
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:44,568
Everything appears normal, Alfred.

80
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:47,609
Then you and I were simply victims of hypnosis?

81
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,579
Not we.

82
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,576
When The Batwave sounded it jarred you

83
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,583
and the other butlers from your trance

84
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,594
but my hallucinations continued

85
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,597
hallucinations so powerful

86
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:01,591
they could only be the work of a spellbinder.

87
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,589
A spellbinder, sir?

88
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,595
During my studies in the Far East

89
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:07,593
<i>I learned of a remote temple</i>

90
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,607
<i>whose monks performed a particularly intense</i>

91
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,594
<i>form of meditation believed to lead to that</i>

92
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,599
<i>which only few could achieve</i>

93
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,605
<i>the mystic power of the third eye</i>

94
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:20,603
a state of awareness so pure or potent

95
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:23,646
one could project one's visions into reality.

96
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,616
So our three-eyed scoundrel

97
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,611
possesses an enlightened mind

98
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,617
and a corrupted soul?

99
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,615
If last night was only a rehearsal

100
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,624
I believe he's after a fourth eye.

101
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:36,627
The Sarkana gemstone?

102
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:38,631
And since Spellbinder somehow managed to implant

103
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,662
you and the butlers with hypnotic suggestions

104
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,624
he'll no doubt trigger you three to steal it for him.

105
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,644
Me? Steal from charity?

106
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,654
'You must lock me up at once!'

107
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,645
Well, it's no Arkham Asylum, but it should hold you.

108
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,654
I shall be quite comfortable here, sir.

109
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:59,637
Perhaps just some reading.

110
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,655
And a spot of tea.

111
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,659
Oh, and a telly..

112
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:05,643
To view live auction coverage of The Batman

113
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,649
trouncing thieving butlers, of course.

114
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:10,677
Right away then, sir.

115
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,666
<i>How do you intend to resist the hallucinations</i>

116
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,658
<i>upon your next encounter?</i>

117
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:18,696
<i>By relying on my training.</i>

118
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:26,677
<i>The only defense against a spellbinder</i>

119
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,710
<i>is strength of mind.</i>

120
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,705
'And there's the high priest of Sarkana'

121
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,702
'holding the box containing'

122
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,712
'the fabled Eye of Sarkana gemstone'

123
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:56,739
'said to be auctioned to benefit the blind children's charity'

124
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,709
'just as soon as our other host, Bruce Wayne, arrives.'

125
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,720
No sign of any zombie butlers there..

126
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:07,730
Or here yet.

127
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,754
- Where's Wayne? - This is embarrassing!

128
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,754
Zombie billionaires?

129
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,738
Spellbinder got to the whole blasted lot of us.

130
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,774
But how?

131
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:45,760
'The photographer!'

132
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,763
<i>He was spellbinder.</i>

133
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,749
<i>He used the photo shoots to implant us</i>

134
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:51,762
<i>with hypnotic suggestion</i>

135
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:53,763
<i>triggered later by the sight of any clock</i>

136
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,796
<i>at its pre-designated time!</i>

137
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:00,762
And now, The Batman's searching for butlers

138
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:03,802
when in fact, he should be seeking himself!

139
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,811
No sign of marauding butlers

140
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,831
and the auction's set to..

141
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,811
<i>Bring the Eye of Sarkana to me.</i>

142
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:26,801
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

143
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,800
If The Batman is found hypnotized.

144
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,795
Spellbinder might well discover

145
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,824
that he and Bruce Wayne are one and the same!

146
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:46,839
Of course! The Batwave could break Master Bruce's spell.

147
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,818
Blast. Think, Pennyworth.

148
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:54,847
There must be a way out.

149
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,823
Right, then.

150
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,841
And to help these children to mold the power

151
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:06,843
of inner sight my temple humbly presents

152
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,854
'the Eye of Sarkana!'

153
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,849
- Where is it? - 'It's gone.'

154
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,874
- 'What-what happened?' - 'Missing?'

155
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:23,879
Ah, my eye candy.

156
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:45,896
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

157
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:54,904
Quite a sticky wicket.

158
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,888
You should never have put yourself

159
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,900
in my sights again.

160
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:14,915
Or are things not quite as they appear?

161
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,946
The Batman I most certainly am not.

162
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,937
Yes.

163
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:38,955
Hypnotized.

164
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,952
Could it be..

165
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,958
That you are..

166
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,965
'Master Bruce, snap out of it!'

167
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:01,948
Blindsided by a cheap trick!

168
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:03,943
It's what I do.

169
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,972
Well, here's lookin' at you.

170
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,981
Growl

171
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:20,988
clank clank clank.

172
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:36,995
Mine.

173
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,979
Years of meditation to become a common thief?

174
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:43,995
It seems that you're blind to the stone's true value.

175
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:48,021
The Eye of Sarkana will enhance my mystic power.

176
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:52,010
You saw what I could do before.

177
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:54,033
Now feel it!

178
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,014
A strong mind perceives its own reality.

179
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,054
Question is, how strong is your mind?

180
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,050
Bloop bloop bloop

181
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:49,089
thump thump thump.

182
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:08,096
No!

183
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:11,104
Thud.

184
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,086
A treat for all of the senses.

185
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,118
Wouldn't you say, Batman?

186
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:27,100
<i>A strong mind perceives its own reality.</i>

187
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:32,114
<i>Its own reality!</i>

188
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,153
'Spellbinder!'

189
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:05,167
What do you know? An eye for an eye.

190
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,145
'"Recovered gemstone fetches'

191
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,157
'eye-popping sum for charity."'

192
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,175
Well done, sir.

193
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,135
And this time it's Spellbinder

194
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,149
'whose photo made the paper.'

195
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,157
Well, now that the gem

196
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:22,153
and our prized heirloom are back in hand

197
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,148
if you don't mind, Master Bruce

198
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,148
I would like to make up the sleep I've lost

199
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,172
with an afternoon nap.

200
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,158
Pleasant dreams, Alfred.

201
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,194
Oh, no dreams, sir.

202
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,197
'I think we both had an eyeful.'

203
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,223
