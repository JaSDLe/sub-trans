1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,008
'We're experiencing what experts are calling'

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:16,002
'the harshest winter Gotham's seen in a hundred years.'

3
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,009
'So with the roads iced over and six more inches due'

4
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:22,003
'turn that radiator up and the alarm clock off'

5
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,006
'because you're not gettin' to work tomorrow'

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,048
'unless you can fly.'

7
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,029
slam.

8
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:41,036
'Come down with your hands up!'

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,056
You shouldn't play with Firefly.

10
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:50,059
- Phew! - Phew.

11
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:53,060
- Uh! - Ah.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,059
Screech.

13
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:01,057
Those guys okay?

14
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,044
Yeah, they're alright.

15
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:06,048
In this town, <i>I'm the heat.</i>

16
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:09,086
You're all sizzle and no steak.

17
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,094
Burn, Batman!

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,078
Creak.

19
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:16,099
Uh!

20
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,081
Crash

21
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:30,107
pew pew pew.

22
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:34,091
So how'd you plan on getting me down?

23
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,100
You'll have to land when you run out of fuel.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,109
Well, let's fill her up, then.

25
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:45,114
Pew

26
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:51,111
boom.

27
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:50,175
♪ The Batman ♪

28
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,207
thud Unh!

29
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:21,197
Forget Firefly.

30
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:24,222
We just scored chief's public enemy number one.

31
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:31,203
I'm really not feeling the love here, fellas.

32
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:32,233
Beep.

33
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,198
Whoa!

34
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:38,226
Screech

35
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:45,229
bang bang bang swoosh

36
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,234
click click.

37
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:58,230
'Detective Yin.'

38
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:01,222
You and Firefly threw quite the winter barbecue.

39
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,221
It was a blast, do we know what he took

40
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,233
from the technologies firm?

41
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,240
Working on it.

42
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:08,243
'Firefly's always been work-for-hire.'

43
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,230
If we knew what he took

44
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,272
maybe we'd know who he took it for.

45
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:17,266
Thud whoosh.

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,278
Honey, I'm home.

47
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:29,251
Creak Brought you a present.

48
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:32,277
Gotham city... in the palm of your hand.

49
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,298
Is this a joke?

50
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,272
Saw it in a window, Boss Frost.

51
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,261
Thought of you.

52
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,287
Grrr!

53
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,298
Cool your jets. I got the other thing, too.

54
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,279
Nice.

55
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:54,275
You don't know the half of it.

56
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,276
I also fried the bat.

57
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,279
And you saw his cold remains?

58
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:03,307
Well, I didn't exactly see where I left..

59
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:09,288
You risked putting the Batman hot on our trail.

60
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,309
Okay, okay, chill. Bat showed.

61
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,302
What was I supposed to do?

62
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:17,322
Nothing must stand in my way when I..

63
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,344
When <i>we extend Gotham's</i>

64
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,317
harsh winter into permafrost.

65
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,325
The city will be ours to shake up

66
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:31,335
or shake down anytime we want.

67
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,325
Nine-piece band, check.

68
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:40,363
Decorations, check.

69
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,364
Dinner napkins..

70
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,328
Oh, it would seem that, despite the cold

71
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:49,329
the Gotham Police Gala has become quite the hot ticket.

72
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:50,345
Though I must say, Master Bruce

73
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,346
I find your hosting of the event a bit ironic

74
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,346
given the Dark Knight's vigilante standing

75
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,355
with the blue knights.

76
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,345
It's the least I could do for Gotham's finest, Alfred.

77
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:05,355
Or perhaps it's your way of seeking what the Batman

78
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,390
cannot have, the approval of Gotham's finest.

79
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,372
Slurp.

80
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,396
Yes, yes, I'm fired. I know.

81
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,378
The Batwave.

82
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,365
A break-in..

83
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,398
At Wayne Industries?

84
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:48,418
Thud.

85
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:55,406
"Liquid nitrogen. Do not touch."

86
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,437
Creak poof.

87
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,437
Ahh..

88
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,444
Clang.

89
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:16,422
I was expecting someone with a little more flair.

90
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:19,450
Such a chilly reception, Batman.

91
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:23,446
Crackle crackle crackle.

92
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:26,469
Aah! My eyes!

93
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,467
Crash.

94
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,452
Hmm, how shall I ice you, Batman?

95
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:59,458
Allow me to pick your frozen brain.

96
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:02,485
Whirr.

97
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,498
"Liquid nitrogen."

98
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:23,524
Boom.

99
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,535
Yah! Ha-ha-ha-haa.

100
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:40,530
Rumble rumble

101
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,524
crash

102
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,545
thud.

103
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:12,532
So what could the unlikely pair of fire and ice

104
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:14,555
be building together?

105
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:20,547
It is time to swap one dark suit for another, Master Bruce.

106
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,559
The policemen's gala begins shortly.

107
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,553
Uh, the roads are iced over, Alfred.

108
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:28,549
Sounds like the perfect alibi for a no-show to me.

109
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,593
Now, now, you are the celebrity host.

110
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,569
Do you think it's wise to risk

111
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,587
'rousing the suspicion of hundreds of police?'

112
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,571
I'll put in some quick face time

113
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,596
deliver my toast, and duck back out.

114
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:45,597
Crackle crackle crackle

115
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:53,571
beep beep whirr.

116
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:56,587
The vents are rerouted, Boss Frost.

117
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:58,620
'The heat that flows through these vents'

118
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,619
'warms every building in Gotham.'

119
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:06,596
With my cryo-accelerator..

120
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,622
We can do something about that.

121
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:32,617
The guy obviously thinks he's some kinda crusader

122
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,625
but he's doing more harm than good, Wayne.

123
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,647
You're lucky the bat only trashed your lab.

124
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:40,628
The bat is lucky I wasn't there.

125
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:42,626
I would've opened a can of hurt on him

126
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,665
and personally dragged him to your doorstep.

127
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,646
You're my kinda guy, Wayne.

128
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,664
Cider, Chief Rojas?

129
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,650
Huh? Oh, uh, sure.

130
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:56,653
Don't mind if I..

131
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:57,679
Uh..

132
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,663
Whoo! Appreciate the save, Ellen.

133
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:08,674
You looked like a man in need of a rescue.

134
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:11,663
Wow, they tell me just about every badge

135
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,659
in Gotham's here tonight.

136
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,694
Makes you wonder who's protecting the city.

137
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,690
Uh, I'd better rehearse my toast.

138
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,681
Wayne.

139
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:27,700
I know your secret.

140
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:29,712
Excuse me?

141
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,674
It's been quite an act.

142
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:32,691
You really had me snowed.

143
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,686
Uh, I'm afraid I don't know what you're...

144
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,688
Need me to spell it out for you?

145
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:40,683
There are two sides to Bruce Wayne.

146
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,694
Most people look at you and think rich party boy.

147
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:46,690
Does the whole charity thing just for the PR.

148
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,688
But I can see..

149
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,728
This isn't a front.

150
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,733
You really care, don't you?

151
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,699
Boy.

152
00:11:58,723 --> 00:11:59,717
You've got my number.

153
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,744
Guilty as charged.

154
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:05,714
Whoosh.

155
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:08,720
The freeze-o-matic 9000's ready to blow.

156
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:12,754
As the cryo-accelerator amplifies my powers tenfold.

157
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,758
Gothamites will have nowhere to turn, as block by city block

158
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,736
they are frozen out of their homes.

159
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,728
And what better block to beta-test

160
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,729
than where the entire police force

161
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:27,728
fortuitously assembles tonight.

162
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,735
'I can hear 'em now.'

163
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,759
How did these ice cubes get in my shorts?

164
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:34,775
Let us begin.

165
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,764
Whirr.

166
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,776
Fire up!

167
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,780
Rumble

168
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:02,801
crash Arrrhhhh!

169
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,787
And we sleep warmer in our beds

170
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,809
knowing that you are there.

171
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:17,813
That is why I am pleased to donate..

172
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:25,816
Huh, radiator must be on the fritz.

173
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:26,882
Hiss crackle crackle crackle

174
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:45,892
click

175
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,903
swoosh screech

176
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,921
crash.

177
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:13,913
Where there's frost, there's fire.

178
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:19,933
Next.

179
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,908
Second stop on the freezer burn tour..

180
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:26,941
'...City hall.'

181
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:36,918
The Batman!

182
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,920
Don't sweat it, chief! I got him!

183
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,947
Pew

184
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:45,959
crash

185
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:52,972
zap crash

186
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,985
pew.

187
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,962
Uh-oh.

188
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,993
Crackle crackle kaboom.

189
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,981
Idiot! You've damaged the cryo-accelerator!

190
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,992
We'll fix it. Chill!

191
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:37,995
<i>You chill!</i>

192
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:40,004
Aah!

193
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:43,008
Huh! Ugh!

194
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:56,025
Thud

195
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,041
beep.

196
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,042
Your demise, Batman may warm even my heart.

197
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:10,031
Pew pew.

198
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:13,020
Ugh!

199
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:15,055
That was cold, Jack!

200
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,056
Pew pew pew.

201
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,070
'Time to bring the heat.'

202
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,058
whirr.

203
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,108
He has started the boiler!

204
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,087
Yeah? Well, some like it hot!

205
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,064
Aah! My fuel tank!

206
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:55,089
Unh!

207
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:07,086
Bye-bye, Batman.

208
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:14,103
Aah!

209
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,103
'Feed a cold, starve a fever.'

210
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,120
- Ooh.. - Aah..

211
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:46,119
Uh, I remember Wayne's speech and then zip.

212
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,114
What happened?

213
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,142
'Hey! Check this out!'

214
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:59,117
Freeze and Firefly did this?

215
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:01,132
Well, they won't be giving us any more trouble.

216
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:05,124
- Nice work, boys. - It-it wasn't us, chief.

217
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,154
It was him.

218
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:09,150
Swoosh.

219
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:20,160
Ugh-uh! G-g-get him!

220
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,147
The Batman? He saved us.

221
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:24,184
And he saved the city.

222
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:13,234
