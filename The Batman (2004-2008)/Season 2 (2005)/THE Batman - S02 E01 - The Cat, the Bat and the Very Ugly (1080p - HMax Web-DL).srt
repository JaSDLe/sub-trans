1
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,040
Clang.

2
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:36,059
Mm, meow.

3
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:42,065
Paws off, puddy.

4
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:47,036
Hello, it's a cat. The jewel's mine.

5
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,048
I beg to differ, my feline felon

6
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:54,061
and so do my companions.

7
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,040
Ha!

8
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:59,056
Ha..

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,039
Hm.

10
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,053
Now, how could I say no

11
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:05,080
to those beady blue eyes?

12
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,063
Well, Mama Cobblepot did always say

13
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,094
I was a handsome one.

14
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,071
You know, perhaps

15
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:20,061
we can come to some sort of arrangement.

16
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:23,064
Hm? What you have in mind, good-lookin'?

17
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:26,076
This gem happens to be one of a pair.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,078
The cat is all yours if you help me steal

19
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:32,114
the true object of my desire.

20
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,100
A partnership! Mrreow.

21
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:29,158
♪ The Batman ♪

22
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,157
Millions of dollars worth of art and valuables

23
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:52,151
skipped over for a jeweled cat.

24
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:54,172
This heist has all the earmarks of Catwoman

25
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:57,156
except for the other point of entry.

26
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,191
She had help, a second perp.

27
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,175
I want everyone to recanvass the exterior.

28
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,205
Let's move.

29
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,220
Whirr

30
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:35,220
beep beep.

31
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,208
The tome you requested, Master Bruce.

32
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,204
A second perp doesn't fit her profile.

33
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,249
Catwoman works alone.

34
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,214
Well, partnerships do appear

35
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:52,211
to be all the rage these days.

36
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,231
Detective Yin is a good cop, Alfred.

37
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:56,231
I'm glad she decided to put her trust in The Batman.

38
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,259
Beep beep.

39
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,235
Dander of an eastern European raven.

40
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,231
It's one of Penguin's birds.

41
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:06,229
But why would Catwoman team with Oswald Cobblepot?

42
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:08,237
'Here's why.'

43
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:11,268
The relic stolen last night is one of a pair..

44
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:18,258
'...with Ra, the Egyptian Sun God.'

45
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,255
The very same relic currently on loan

46
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,260
to the Museum Of Natural History here in Gotham?

47
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:26,248
A cat and a bird.

48
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,248
Two jewels, two villains.

49
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:31,281
And one crime-fighter capable of stopping them.

50
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,298
Caw.

51
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,274
Digital surveillance

52
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,284
state-of-the-art electronic security.

53
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:53,289
Hm, the museum's a tough nut to crack

54
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:56,289
but I know where the soft spots are.

55
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,289
Ooh, with my birds and your know-how

56
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:04,292
the two of us will be sitting in the ol' catbird seat.

57
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:07,296
Sounds cozy, Penguie baby

58
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,306
but cats and birds are natural enemies, you know?

59
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,304
Well, with enemies like you, cat-chickie

60
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,327
who needs friends?

61
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:25,319
A little privacy, puh-lease!

62
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:29,341
Yes. Why don't you go fetch me a saucer of Moo Juice?

63
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:35,339
A-ah! Manners!

64
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,361
Fine! Good riddance! And don't come back!

65
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:50,342
Alone at last.

66
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:54,367
Oh, Ozzie, you've stolen my heart.

67
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:01,525
Too bad I'm gonna break yours

68
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,369
once I steal both those jewels.

69
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,385
Vroom.

70
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,402
Hm?

71
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:41,420
Caw.

72
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:44,391
Hey!

73
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:45,428
Uh, uh..

74
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,414
Surveillance down.

75
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,429
What about that state-of-the-art security?

76
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,412
Well, don't you worry

77
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,442
your pretty little head, Penguie.

78
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,446
The Catwoman knows a trick or two.

79
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:30,429
Ah, phenomenal.

80
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,436
You know, according to Egyptian legend

81
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,445
the cat goddess enabled ol' Ra here

82
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,479
to harness the power of the sun.

83
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,443
How nice for them.

84
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,466
And where is my kitty, cutie-cakes?

85
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,478
Such a shame to break up the set.

86
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,464
Oh, The Batman!

87
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,470
You never call, you never write.

88
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,499
Three's a crowd, Bat jerk!

89
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,458
You two want souvenirs of your visit

90
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,503
try the gift shop.

91
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,512
Thud thud thud.

92
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,492
Quite a pair.

93
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,505
Oh, about that, sweetie

94
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,500
I prefer to work alone.

95
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,500
I was referring to these!

96
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,516
You double-crossing me?

97
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,550
So sorry for stringing you along, sugarplum

98
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,553
but you're not my type. They are.

99
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,560
I trusted you.

100
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:09,535
Huh?

101
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,532
I brought this pretty bracelet

102
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:12,575
especially for you

103
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,536
but since you two pointy-ears

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,570
make such a cute couple his and hers.

105
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,556
I'll just hang on to the key

106
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,569
and the jewels.

107
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:31,594
Crash

108
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,580
thud.

109
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,596
Now what?

110
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,603
Relax.

111
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:46,608
Oven timer?

112
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,598
It's ready to explode.

113
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:01,613
It's been a blast, Batman.

114
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,609
It's tamper-proof.

115
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:11,600
Oh, well, you're stuck with me.

116
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,611
We need the key.

117
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:16,616
Hm, yet another reason for a Penguin hunt.

118
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:26,648
Growl.

119
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,615
- This way! - This way!

120
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,654
Fine. You lead.

121
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:39,647
Screech Mm, meow.

122
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,649
Hm..

123
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:47,656
I'll drive.

124
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,669
- Whoa! - Hey!

125
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:00,673
'Catwoman?'

126
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,650
I don't believe it.

127
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:05,688
'This baby really purrs.'

128
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,664
'Looks like you have Penguin to blame'

129
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:10,654
for putting me in the driver's seat.

130
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,660
Hm, what's this do?

131
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,660
Curiosity killed the cat.

132
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,699
Mm, kitty's curious about more than just your wheels.

133
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,677
'What's under your hood, handsome?'

134
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:21,691
Ladies first.

135
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,692
Vroom

136
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,710
tap tap tap.

137
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,703
Trust your instincts, Yin.

138
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:50,694
So, Bat beau, when we find the waddling worm-eater

139
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:53,720
I'd like to have at least two minutes alone with him.

140
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,697
You'll both have plenty of alone time

141
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,843
when you're together in the Gotham State Penitentiary.

142
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:04,746
- Batman. - What do you know? It works.

143
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,708
Uh, hi.

144
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:09,718
I thought I'd put our new partnership to the test.

145
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:13,723
Oh, gives his number to all the girls.

146
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:14,756
What's up, detective?

147
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,724
I'm stumped.

148
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:18,760
'I can't ID Catwoman's mysterious partner.'

149
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,730
Thought you might have an idea.

150
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:22,731
I'm tracking a few leads.

151
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,736
- Meow. - 'Excuse me?'

152
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,742
Uh, static on the Batwave.

153
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:29,750
I'll have to get back to you, detective.

154
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:31,956
So he's a little strange, Yin.

155
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,744
He dresses like a bat.

156
00:12:33,768 --> 00:12:34,748
'All-points bulletin.'

157
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:35,754
'The Batman and Catwoman'

158
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,737
'were seen fleeing together'

159
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,764
'from the museum crime scene.'

160
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:43,763
The Batman's the second perp?

161
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:55,782
To think, this could have all been mine.

162
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:12,805
'Penguin's been doing some research.'

163
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:21,798
According to these artifacts

164
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:23,825
'when the two jewels are properly configured'

165
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,829
they're capable of harnessing the power of the sun.

166
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,806
You read ancient Egyptian?

167
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,805
The pictures help.

168
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,792
And so you think.

169
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:35,820
Penguie's looking to reduce his utility bill?

170
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,803
Whoever said cats and birds

171
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:46,837
are natural enemies?

172
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,812
Detective, squad room.

173
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:54,917
Something big's going down.

174
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:03,840
'That's right, I demand one billion dollars by dawn'

175
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:07,827
'or Gotham suffers the wrath of the sun.'

176
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:09,833
Sun? In the middle of the night?

177
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:10,872
This Penguin guy's nuts.

178
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,874
'Oh, allow me to demonstrate!'

179
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,843
Lights..

180
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,885
Camera, destruction!

181
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,922
'Oh, you gotta love those ancient Egyptian engineers.'

182
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,898
'Wire the money to my Swiss Bank account by sunrise'

183
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:07,909
'or my next target will be full of civilians.'

184
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:10,924
clang

185
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,916
vroom.

186
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,908
- My, who's the popular one? - Batman.

187
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,906
'Cat's out of the bag, partner.'

188
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,915
'I know you're with Catwoman.'

189
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:23,946
He is.

190
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,912
Trust me, detective. It's complicated.

191
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:28,926
'I have to trust you. You're needed.'

192
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,992
Penguin's holding Gotham hostage with some sort of..

193
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,929
'Ancient Egyptian light machine.'

194
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:36,922
'I know, and I know where to find him'

195
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,924
the only bird's-eye view of Gotham

196
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:41,943
with a powerful enough light source.

197
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,946
If Penguin sees us coming, he might get trigger-happy.

198
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,946
Well, there's only one stairwell.

199
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,968
We don't need stairs.

200
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:04,960
Uh, aren't seagulls usually white?

201
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,979
They're Penguin's birds.

202
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:27,991
Here comes Miss Congeniality.

203
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,023
Uh... up you go.

204
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:19,045
I never did get my saucer of milk.

205
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:49,087
Ew! Nails on a chalkboard.

206
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:59,071
I could dance all night, partner.

207
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:02,082
Let's shake a crow from his nest.

208
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:07,096
Ah..

209
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:10,088
Thud Huh?

210
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:14,079
Well, well, look what the cat dragged in.

211
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:15,093
It's over, Penguin.

212
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:18,075
Bye-bye, birdie.

213
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,083
Any closer

214
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:22,096
and Gotham Children's Hospital is rubble!

215
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,086
I possess the power of Ra!

216
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,125
I, Penguin, Pharaoh of Gotham!

217
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:53,146
Squeak.

218
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,133
The cat.

219
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,135
You mean, after all we've been through?

220
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,152
Come on. Throw a dog a bone.

221
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,143
Well, alright!

222
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,162
Sorry, handsome!

223
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,173
Not so fast, kitty-cat!

224
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,157
The triple-crosses end here.

225
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:30,171
We had a deal, fish breath! No!

226
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,158
Hey!

227
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:37,186
Hm, made for each other.

228
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:40,187
Come on!

229
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,188
Thud.

230
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:49,188
Hang on! Here's our ride.

231
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,178
Bye-bye, Bat!

232
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:00,183
Now, take us to your spare key.

233
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:03,204
Huh? What spare key?

234
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,194
Batman?

235
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,419
The coast is clear, detective.

236
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,260
But I highly recommend keeping the relics separated.

237
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,205
I know this may sound shady

238
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:24,204
but it might be best if I held on to one

239
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,214
'for safekeeping.'

240
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,215
Go right ahead, Batman.

241
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,234
'I trust you.'

242
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:07,284
