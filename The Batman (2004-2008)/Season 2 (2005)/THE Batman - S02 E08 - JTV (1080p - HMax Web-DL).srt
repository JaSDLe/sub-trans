1
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:17,032
- Coming through, sir. - Take a load off, Alfred.

2
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:22,006
Jolly good, then.

3
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,047
Oh, dear. I trust Master Bruce did pay the cable bill.

4
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,026
Good evening, Gotham!

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,011
Joker.

6
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:35,024
It's me, your most underrated entertainer.

7
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:38,029
'Oh, how I've tried to make you all laugh'

8
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:41,031
but I'm not feelin' the love, people.

9
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:44,033
Every time I bring my brand of funny to Gotham

10
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:47,058
the only sound I hear is..

11
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,039
But who can blame you?

12
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:55,044
You're all glued to your idiot boxes.

13
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,050
'And since the media chooses to focus'

14
00:00:57,074 --> 00:01:01,056
'on the tragic side of my crime career..'

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,055
it seems some hilarious counterprograming is in order.

16
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,065
So stay tuned for my brand-new sitcom..

17
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:12,056
' "..Me And The Mayor!"'

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,054
What happens when you team the crazy crime clown

19
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:18,096
with Gotham's very own Mayor Grange?

20
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,071
Can't miss comedy, folks.

21
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:27,071
And it premieres tonight on my very own private network.

22
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:32,104
JTV just as soon as I abduct my co-star.

23
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,113
Shall I tape it for you, sir?

24
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,168
♪ The Batman ♪

25
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:01,172
Next time Joker decides to target the mayor

26
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:02,178
I'll drive.

27
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,205
Sorry, partner

28
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,168
but Cash Tankinson always drives.

29
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,182
Does Cash Tankinson always wear sunglasses at night

30
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:12,199
and speak in third person? Just curious.

31
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,189
Yeah, chief warned me you'd resent the new guy, so..

32
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:19,198
I'm your first since what's-his-name, huh?

33
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:23,208
Bennett. His name was Ethan Bennett.

34
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:32,197
A real shame Joker went and turned him into clay-face

35
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,238
but Cash Tankinson don't melt so easy.

36
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,239
I'm the last partner you'll ever need, Yin.

37
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,220
I somehow doubt that.

38
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,231
Vroom.

39
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,226
What kind of nut announces his crimes

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,220
before he commits them?

41
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,229
Joker has to be kidding

42
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:59,232
if he thinks he could get past Gotham PD.

43
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:01,264
Joker's not kidding, mayor.

44
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,232
H-h-he's joking!

45
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:06,245
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,249
He's joking.

47
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,269
- Joker? - 'It's The Joker!'

48
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:37,289
Get ready for your close-up, Mr. Mayor.

49
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,262
On the floor, clown boy!

50
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:43,293
Cash Tankinson's kickin' butt and takin' names!

51
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,274
Stop! Ha-ha, stop!

52
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,312
Such classic dialogue!

53
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,280
What deadpan delivery!

54
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:56,292
'You are hee-haw-larious!'

55
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:58,296
'Ever consider acting? You're good.'

56
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Clown boy, you're goin'..

57
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,327
Down?

58
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,312
My card. We'll do lunch.

59
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,348
Thank you, Punch.

60
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,351
Judy, chop-chop.

61
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,335
Joker and The Batman.

62
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,371
Sweet.

63
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,346
Tankinson!

64
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,368
Tankinson, wait up! Oh!

65
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,373
Thud The Batman?

66
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:17,356
My biggest fan.

67
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,392
Punch, run this out to him, please.

68
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,393
Bam vroom.

69
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:40,378
Judy, I think this is our turn.

70
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,417
Screech.

71
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,401
Hm, might have a better chance losing him

72
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,424
in something sportier.

73
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,436
Screech.

74
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,444
Happy trails, sparky!

75
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:08,449
Crash

76
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:13,445
vroom screech.

77
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:17,423
Say hello to Cash Tankinson..

78
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:20,439
The detective who finally arrests The Batman.

79
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:23,461
- Look, the mayor's in... - Hey, I didn't vote for him.

80
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:28,468
I can't let the two new men in my life meet like this.

81
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,438
Nice work, Yin.

82
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,823
Just whose back do you got, anyway?

83
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,453
You ditched me!

84
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,470
I always watch my partner's back.

85
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,462
Vroom.

86
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,494
- 'Sir.' - Anything good on the tube?

87
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,464
The Gators are trailing miserably.

88
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,459
'So are we, but I have the feeling'

89
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:58,486
'Joker's about to announce his next move.'

90
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:01,533
Quite astute you are, sir.

91
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,489
"Me And The Mayor" is about to premiere.

92
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:09,511
Help! Someone help me! Please!

93
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:15,484
Oh, why the long face, Mairzy Doats?

94
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:18,506
Let me go, you maniac!

95
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,524
Don't you fret, I have just the thing

96
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,502
to turn your frown upside down.

97
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,505
No. Stop!

98
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,532
I-I have a family.

99
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,514
Why is Joker engaging in this ghastly business?

100
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,516
It isn't just for the laughs.

101
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,528
Ahh, I know that look.

102
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,523
You have another get-rich-quick scheme

103
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,550
don't you?

104
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,536
Bank robbery? That's crazy!

105
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,521
So crazy it might just work.

106
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,545
You're right again, sir.

107
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,539
Joker is shooting on location

108
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,558
at Main Street Bank.

109
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,548
Oh, Punch!

110
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,539
Hey, the mayor and I are gonna rob the old bank.

111
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:19,576
Wanna come?

112
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,574
Now, didn't we all learn an important lesson today?

113
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:44,576
That's right.

114
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,583
With a positive attitude

115
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:49,580
and a smile maybe, just maybe

116
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,582
we can all get along!

117
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,593
Tune in to JTV tomorrow night

118
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:57,591
for a new series and a new co-star.

119
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:59,621
Detective Shades!

120
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,591
Bring it on, clown boy!

121
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,589
You mess with the bull, you'll get the horns.

122
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:08,597
If you let this get personal

123
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,608
it will impair your ability to do your job.

124
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,610
Hey, come on, Yin, doesn't some part of you

125
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:16,595
wanna slap that grin off of Joker's face?

126
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,606
At least for Burnett?

127
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,607
Bennett.

128
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,606
I'm not losing another partner to this madman.

129
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,612
As your senior officer

130
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:26,619
I'm ordering you into a police safe house.

131
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:29,607
What? Police protection?

132
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,628
Cash can take care of Cash.

133
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,629
Fine, then Cash will take care of Cash

134
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,612
off-duty and out of sight

135
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,628
'until we bring Joker down!'

136
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:40,650
Well, good luck handlin' that lunatic all by yourself.

137
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:44,658
And since Cash doesn't think you can..

138
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:49,661
Cash will.

139
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:56,636
'Chasing down Joker's hit-and-run camera crew'

140
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,638
'isn't getting Mayor Grange back any quicker'

141
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:01,639
but if the crime clown's pirating a broadcast signal

142
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,645
maybe we can trace it to its source.

143
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:04,656
And if we can pre-empt JTV

144
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,667
we have a chance of drawing Joker out.

145
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:10,676
Speak of the devil.

146
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:15,684
The frequency's locked on. Tracing it.

147
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,672
And the lummox would be..

148
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,712
Yin's new partner.

149
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,686
He's been set up and he doesn't even know it.

150
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,690
Tankinson?

151
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,678
Oh! I told you to stay away from Joker.

152
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:39,695
Tankinson, get out of there, it's a trap!

153
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,694
I tracked clownie here.

154
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,695
He's mine.

155
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:45,696
If you've found Joker, it's only because he wanted you to.

156
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,696
'He's broadcasting you live, right now!'

157
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,705
I'm on TV?

158
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:52,704
Well, I hope clownie's out for some cash

159
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,731
'cause it's payday, baby.

160
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:05,747
Freeze!

161
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,724
Suave sleuthing there, Shades

162
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:11,745
but just who do you think's filming you?

163
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,740
Oh, no.

164
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,751
Any trace, sir?

165
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:22,727
'I may not need it.'

166
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,748
I know where they are.

167
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,731
Good evening and welcome.

168
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:31,749
We're here to raise money

169
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,752
for a very special cause.

170
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:37,743
Saving Detective Shades' life!

171
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,749
You see, Gotham, if you can't pony up

172
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:43,751
one million dollars in donations to me..

173
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,752
The detective's toast.

174
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,758
So what say we open our hearts

175
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:49,751
'and our checkbooks'

176
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,771
'for our dear friend here?'

177
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:57,764
We just received $50 from Grandma Shades.

178
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:00,763
She says "Please don't harm my grandson

179
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:02,761
I beg you."

180
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,803
Human compassion at its finest.

181
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,799
Okay, time to roll those numbers!

182
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:17,796
Oh! Looks like a lost cause.

183
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,784
Maybe it's best we just put this pup down.

184
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:22,801
What-what are you doin'? No!

185
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:24,826
Stop, stop. No! No!

186
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,817
Thud.

187
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:40,809
'Sir.'

188
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,194
All frequencies running to and from

189
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,817
the six active television transmitters

190
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:45,805
here in Gotham have been traced

191
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:47,813
but there wasn't a pirate frequency among them.

192
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:51,813
Active? Then maybe Joker's using an oldie but goodie.

193
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,826
Of course.

194
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,846
'The abandoned Gotham Radio King Tower.'

195
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,832
Now, why would you want to pull the plug on JTV

196
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,864
when we've been such a ratings smash?

197
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,881
Gotham's been riveted to their sets

198
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,850
but once again, no one's laughing!

199
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,889
Maybe it's you, Joker. Maybe you're just not funny.

200
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,859
It's the viewing public who doesn't have a sense of humor

201
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:33,895
but I have just the thing to make 'em laugh

202
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,866
die laughing, in fact!

203
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,896
Lights!

204
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:46,865
'Dispensers of Joker gas'

205
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,885
<i>scattered throughout the city</i>

206
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,875
<i>and through the beauty of wireless</i>

207
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,879
<i>they've been set to empty their chuckle-inducing contents</i>

208
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,884
<i>during the course of my next transmission.</i>

209
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:58,896
And with the city dying of laughter

210
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,891
it'll be yours to plunder.

211
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:02,890
You betcha, Batsie!

212
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,927
I was going to activate them during a ratings stunt

213
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,920
'when I write these two tired characters off the show.'

214
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:18,900
But now, what could make

215
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,938
more compelling TV than..

216
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,946
Joker versus The Batman?

217
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:32,950
Poof.

218
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,928
'Tonight on "The Joker.."'

219
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:49,946
'...will Batman defeat our charismatic star'

220
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,945
'in time to save the hostages?'

221
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:55,945
'Will Joker finally take control of Gotham once and for all?'

222
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,955
'To find out, stay tuned.'

223
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:02,964
Same Joker crime same Joker channel!

224
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,980
Poof.

225
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:29,005
Don't worry, I promise a fair fight.

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,977
And by fair, I mean, totally stacked in my favor.

227
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:40,005
Come on, Batsie, smile for the camera!

228
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:44,005
Ew!

229
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,028
If he stops the signal, he'll stop the gas!

230
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:01,021
Don't let him reach the top of the tower!

231
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:27,065
I have one partner down and one who might need backup.

232
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:30,064
Poof.

233
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,045
Ah, music to my ears.

234
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:50,076
Just a few more deep breaths, Gotham.

235
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:24,084
I-I don't, I don't get it.

236
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,095
Oh.

237
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,102
What happened?

238
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,096
What was so funny?

239
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,131
Ooh, he can't win! This is my show!

240
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:39,121
Guess I'll have to settle with being the sore loser.

241
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:46,107
Sorry, but JTV's cutting all ties

242
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,126
with you two has-beens.

243
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,134
Thud.

244
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:00,136
Joker, you've been canceled.

245
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,155
So have they.

246
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,167
Snap.

247
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:20,167
No! Ugh!

248
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,181
Appreciate the backup.

249
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,165
Speaking of, I'm not the only cop

250
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,198
who followed your television exploits.

251
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,175
'While Gotham citizens are recovering tonight'

252
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,183
after minor exposure to Joker gas

253
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:48,185
the rescued hostages, Mayor Grange

254
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:52,177
and Detective Cash Tankinson are listed in good condition

255
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:56,203
thanks to an antidote believed to be left behind by The Batman.

256
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,202
I hate TV. Oh!

257
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,189
Detective Ellen Yin recommends

258
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,184
refraining from excess chitchat

259
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,201
if Cash wants to be back on the street anytime soon.

260
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:11,208
About that, Yin it, uh, doesn't look like

261
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,235
we'll be workin' together anymore.

262
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,201
I, uh requested a transfer to a desk job

263
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,242
need a break from the action.

264
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,204
Really?

265
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,227
Probably just as well.

266
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:30,231
'I prefer a strong, silent partner.'

267
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,278
