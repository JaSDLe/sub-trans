1
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:17,998
What's bomb squad doing in there?

2
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:20,020
We can't have much time left.

3
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:28,024
- Well? - Can't ID The green stuff.

4
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,022
But the wiring's the real deal.

5
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:32,047
They're definitely rigged to blow.

6
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,042
And the word game?

7
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:38,030
'That kind of thing wasn't exactly covered'

8
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,057
'in basic training.'

9
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:46,032
'Yin, get everyone out of there already!'

10
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:48,069
Right away, chief. I'm right behind you.

11
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:55,054
You know we can't let them see us together.

12
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:58,079
If they do, just tell them I'm your prisoner.

13
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:03,060
"When you do not know what I am, then I am something

14
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:07,054
"but when you know what I am, then I am nothing.

15
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,067
'What am I?"'

16
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:11,060
We'll be nothing if we don't leave right now.

17
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:14,078
I am a riddle.

18
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,091
Okay.

19
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:34,092
No one needs to see us run out of here together

20
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:36,088
and I get to keep my badge.

21
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,102
'Bravo!'

22
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:41,095
Uh, someone is very bright.

23
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,121
Step into the light..

24
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:49,122
So The Riddler can see you.

25
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,174
♪ The Batman ♪

26
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:59,160
Uh, someone is very bright.

27
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,189
Step into the light..

28
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,192
So The Riddler can see you.

29
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,179
I was expecting my worthy opponent

30
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:15,179
to be... taller.

31
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,195
Introduce yourself.

32
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:20,206
Yin. Detective Ellen Yin.

33
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,206
Where's the boom?

34
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,197
'Hello, Gotham PD!'

35
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,195
'I am The Riddler'

36
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,196
'and Detective Yin here has just proven herself'

37
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,205
'qualified to play.'

38
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,200
Play? Play what?

39
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:40,208
A battle of wits, a duel of intellects

40
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:43,208
a night of riddles scattered throughout Gotham

41
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,218
'for you to solve'

42
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,220
and you alone.

43
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:48,251
'Hear that, chief?'

44
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,832
'You'll never know when I'll be watching'

45
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,225
'or listening.'

46
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,257
'And if I hear anyone help with answers'

47
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,228
or see police uniforms anywhere near Detective Yin.

48
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:02,223
'Gotham loses big time!'

49
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,240
What's your deal, Riddler?

50
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:05,234
Why are you doing this?

51
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,242
Uh-uh.

52
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:09,236
I'm the one posing the riddles here

53
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,243
and I have another just for you.

54
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:15,234
Ready to play?

55
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:17,255
<i>To cross the water, I'm the way.</i>

56
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,256
<i>For water, I'm above.</i>

57
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,241
<i>I touch it not, and truth to say</i>

58
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:25,280
<i>I neither swim nor move.</i>

59
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:33,257
Swim nor.. Uh, I hate riddles!

60
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,273
And I don't play games with madmen!

61
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:36,298
Follow her!

62
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,287
Screech.

63
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:55,298
Gotham Bridge. A two-year-old could've figured that one out.

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,291
You know, we can't let Riddler see us together, either.

65
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:03,291
Or hear us. Riddler may have hacked the police frequency.

66
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,290
'But he can't crack Batwave.'

67
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,311
Two heads are better than.. Huh?

68
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,342
My keen detective skills tell me this is..

69
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,322
Ah, you made it, detective.

70
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:30,325
'Pity about your hard drive over here'

71
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,325
'but the bridge is set to blow'

72
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,340
'and only you can prevent it.'

73
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,355
Good luck.

74
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,363
What? Riddler, where's the riddle?

75
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,340
'The screen. The riddle's a puzzle.'

76
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:46,350
'Try the center square.'

77
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,370
Top row, center.

78
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,353
'Steady, all part of the game.'

79
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:58,350
beep 'Well, well, detective.'

80
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:00,352
You're quite the gamesmith.

81
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:03,359
Just keep playing by my rules.

82
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:05,365
What's this?

83
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,358
Yin, what are you doing?

84
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,356
I don't see any explosives here.

85
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,396
Under the bridge.

86
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,356
Uh-uh. I said, no help, chief.

87
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,399
Time to learn a lesson about following rules.

88
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,390
'Detective Yin still gets a chance'

89
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,383
'to solve the puzzle'

90
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,385
'but if you don't get far away from here <i>tout de suite'</i>

91
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,387
'I will blow Gotham Bay Bridge by remote'

92
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,410
'and everyone on it.'

93
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,427
'Bottom right corner.'

94
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,427
crash.

95
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,447
'Column four, row three.'

96
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:13,433
- 'Column one, row... ' - I got it. I got it!

97
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,420
'Well done, Yinsy.'

98
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,465
The bridge survives

99
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,428
but will you?

100
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:28,450
And only you can answer that riddle.

101
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:46,478
Thud.

102
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,475
Nice save.

103
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:11,483
Detective, what a surprise!

104
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:14,476
You must have a guardian angel

105
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,475
watching over you.

106
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,477
Ready for your next riddle?

107
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,491
No! No more riddles!

108
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,489
What do you want, you maniac?

109
00:08:21,513 --> 00:08:23,497
'I prefer brainiac.'

110
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:28,522
As you've been learning knowledge is power.

111
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,533
Thud.

112
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,551
'Your other left.'

113
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,549
'"The key to this puzzle you will find'

114
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:18,542
'at last from riddles past."'

115
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,553
From riddles past?

116
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:22,584
'A piano has 88 keys.'

117
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:30,551
"Everything in me..

118
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,565
Everything in me is ancient?"

119
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,571
These riddles hurt my brain!

120
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:37,568
Chief, we located Yin heading for the museum.

121
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:39,576
"Everything in me is ancient?"

122
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,586
Ah, how did she get museum out of that?

123
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,598
Hm. Neanderthal exhibit.

124
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:59,584
'You're getting warm, detective'

125
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:02,589
'yet you're ice cold.'

126
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:04,602
'But if you don't solve the next riddle soon'

127
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:08,600
'the entire city block will be blown back to the ice age.'

128
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,632
You better hope I don't solve it, Riddler

129
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,594
because I'm going to find you

130
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:13,608
and I'm going to bring you down.

131
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:17,598
You couldn't be further from the truth, detective.

132
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:20,606
Oh, now, you're boring me.

133
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,616
On to the final riddle.

134
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,622
'A man builds a house'

135
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:26,618
'with all four sides facing North.'

136
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,617
A bear walks past the house.

137
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,644
What color is the bear?

138
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,634
Facing North?

139
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,642
'What color is the bear?'

140
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:42,625
Knowledge is power.

141
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,634
Pity about your hard drive over here.

142
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,628
You're ice cold.

143
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,644
You couldn't be further from the truth, detective.

144
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:52,633
Oh, now, you're boring me.

145
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,648
Boring.

146
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:54,676
Like a drill.

147
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,648
Riddler can't resist leaving riddles

148
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,658
even ones he shouldn't be.

149
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:02,650
Four sides facing North.

150
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:04,647
Ah, the house is at the South Pole

151
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,687
so it's a polar bear. The answer is white!

152
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,650
Taking a risk, aren't you?

153
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:12,671
There are no bears at the South Pole.

154
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,666
This riddle has no answer.

155
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,674
- Riddler cheated? - Riddler quit.

156
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:18,691
He's through playing.

157
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:22,672
Dessert gelatin?

158
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:25,674
Riddler's been leading us away from the main course

159
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:27,685
further from the truth, all night long.

160
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,686
Which is?

161
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,672
Beneath the last place we'd think to look..

162
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:33,712
Again.

163
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:50,702
Almost done?

164
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,692
Just a few more gigabytes, Riddler sir.

165
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,703
Then drain the brain.

166
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,723
'Freeze, Riddler!'

167
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:01,716
Knowledge is power, huh?

168
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,721
A fitting heist for a brainiac

169
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:05,724
don't you think, Yinsy?

170
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:08,726
If I need money boom, instant access

171
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,723
to Gotham's bank account numbers.

172
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,727
If I want to shut down Gotham's transportation grid

173
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:17,717
boom, instant access to the technical specs.

174
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,724
Information!

175
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:22,737
It's all here in the city's mainframe

176
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:26,765
soon to be uploaded into mine!

177
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,772
But aren't you the smart detective

178
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,732
to see the riddles within my riddles?

179
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:35,739
We can trade IQ scores

180
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:36,755
when you're behind bars, Riddler.

181
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,739
Would that be your IQ or The Batman's?

182
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,757
- I don't know what you're tal... - Please!

183
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,749
Do you think I went to all the trouble

184
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:48,755
to distract Gotham PD from my real crime?

185
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,765
It was The Batman who concerned me.

186
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:54,780
Isn't that right, Batman?

187
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,789
The game ends now, Riddler.

188
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,774
I'll say, for the two of you.

189
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,776
Gotham's infamous <i>vigilante</i>

190
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,768
working hand-in-hand with a cop?

191
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,812
Scandalous.

192
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:25,814
Tell me, Batman..

193
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:30,820
What question can you never answer yes to?

194
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:37,820
Are you asleep?

195
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:50,840
Ah, look who decided to join the party.

196
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:55,857
Welcome to my lair, Batman

197
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,836
where questions are answers

198
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,838
and Yin is yang.

199
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:02,840
Cute, Riddler. Where are we?

200
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:06,831
Why, the same place you've been all night long, Yinsy..

201
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,844
Inside my brain.

202
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:12,834
Stop speaking in riddles. Why are we here?

203
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,852
There is a living riddle walking amongst Gotham

204
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:17,858
that everyone wants answered.

205
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:21,856
Who is The Batman?

206
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,871
You want to know, don't you, Yinsy?

207
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:30,867
Too easy.

208
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,857
Instead, we'll play a game.

209
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,861
Oh, you're gonna love playing shuffleboard

210
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:36,868
in Arkham, Riddler!

211
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,874
Shh..

212
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:43,865
The game is 20 questions twenty yes or no's

213
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,010
from which my brilliant mind

214
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,898
will deduce the true identity of The Batman.

215
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,913
'Now, see the lie detector?'

216
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,896
Answer falsely, Batman, and Yinsy here

217
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,893
'gets more than just the shock of learning your identity.'

218
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,891
Don't tell him anything, Batman!

219
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,896
Question number one.

220
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,931
Do you have blond hair?

221
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,927
He has pink hair. He's from the moon.

222
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,916
Blond, yes or no?

223
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,944
Yes.

224
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:29,909
'Consider that a sample.'

225
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,947
With every false answer, the voltage spikes.

226
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:36,927
Question two, Bat-brunet.

227
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:39,938
Were you born here in Gotham City?

228
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:43,964
- 'Yes.' - 'That's the spirit.'

229
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:48,934
The riddles ended.

230
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:49,944
Yin vanished in thin air

231
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:52,930
and the museum's caked in lime jelly?

232
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,944
'Chief Rojas, the entire City Hall database'

233
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:56,944
'was stolen earlier tonight.'

234
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,968
But we were there! Is this a joke?

235
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:02,985
So you do have a day job.

236
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,963
I'm beginning to get a sense of the real you, Batman.

237
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:10,958
Are you a policeman?

238
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:11,969
Riddler, enough already!

239
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,965
You wanna know who The Batman is? Ask me!

240
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,975
- You don't know. - I do know. He's...

241
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,959
No! No, no, no, you'll ruin my game!

242
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,972
The true identity of The Batman is Ethan Bennett.

243
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:26,007
Duh, I can't hear you!

244
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,001
Riddler, the answer to am I a policeman..

245
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:33,003
Yes.

246
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,018
No one outsmarts The Riddler!

247
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:11,011
We are in Riddler's brain.

248
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,024
His men must be uploading the stolen data.

249
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:17,042
You find them, I'll take Riddler.

250
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,052
Drive 09, begin upload.

251
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,089
'Sorry, fellas.'

252
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,086
You have a virus.

253
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:01,093
Since I can't have Riddler, you'll do.

254
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,105
Riddle for you.

255
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:10,091
Who's next?

256
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:15,082
'Are you a singer? Are you a celebrity?'

257
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:19,105
Are you wealthy? Are you wise?

258
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:34,109
Huh?

259
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:37,127
What's black and blue and green all over?

260
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:45,146
Game's not yours yet, Batman.

261
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:54,122
Hm, and here I thought

262
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,139
this was going to be a battle of wits.

263
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,134
Pretty swift, Yin.

264
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:10,137
Maybe one day you'll put that big brain of yours

265
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:13,135
onto the whole "Who-is-The-Batman thing."

266
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,134
Uh, chief, you may be interested to know

267
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:19,149
someone on your payroll works hand-in-hand

268
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:22,152
with The Batman.

269
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:24,154
Oh, yeah? Who?

270
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:27,164
Ask not who in your force

271
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:31,192
works with The Bat ask why in.

272
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,156
Yin, answer it.

273
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,178
Why in, chief, why in.

274
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:42,167
My name, Yin.

275
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:44,191
Riddler says it's me.

276
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:49,170
Get this lunatic out of here!

277
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,203
Huh?

278
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,174
How would he know?

279
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:57,188
- 'That crazy psychopath!' - Whoo.

280
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,219
The Batman wasn't anywhere in sight tonight!

281
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,220
Nowhere in sight.

282
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:43,258
