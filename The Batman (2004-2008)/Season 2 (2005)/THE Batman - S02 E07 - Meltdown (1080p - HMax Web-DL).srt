1
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,019
Alright, Joker.

2
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,062
Time for your medicine.

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,036
But my dear flunky

4
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,044
you left the meds outside.

5
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:48,029
Not the kind of medicine

6
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:51,062
that I have in mind!

7
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:18,084
Vroom.

8
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:45,127
♪ The Batman ♪

9
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:05,115
Either I'm crazy, or you're melting!

10
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:08,106
It's payback time, Joker.

11
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,114
You're going to suffer for making me what I am!

12
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:14,156
I'll take what I deserve but do I know you?

13
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,163
'Help!

14
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,172
Thud

15
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,172
clank.

16
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:46,151
Out of the way, Bats!

17
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,190
Joker has this coming!

18
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,166
No argument there, Clayface

19
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,161
but I'm not here to help him.

20
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,196
I'm here to help you.

21
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,201
Ha! That the best you have, Bats?

22
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:14,182
You're gonna get the help you need.

23
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:17,202
As for you, Joker, consider yourself..

24
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,213
Lucky.

25
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,223
Clown about town!

26
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,296
'Court is back in session.'

27
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,202
Mr. Brent, you may call your first witness.

28
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:41,222
Your honor, the defense calls Detective Ellen Yin.

29
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:44,205
Detective, your former partner

30
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,220
stands accused of resisting arrest

31
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:48,210
and of the kidnapping and aggravated assault

32
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:51,216
of Chief Angel Rojas.

33
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,213
Shouldn't Ethan Bennett be held responsible for these crimes?

34
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,223
It isn't that cut and dry, Mr. Brent.

35
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:01,239
<i>Detective Bennett was also kidnapped by Joker.</i>

36
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:05,247
<i>He was subjected to intense psychological torment..</i>

37
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,930
<i>And then exposed to unstable chemicals..</i>

38
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,235
<i>Which mutated his body and mind.</i>

39
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,244
'Objection!'

40
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,237
This witness is not qualified

41
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,250
to testify to Clayface's state of mind!

42
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:19,242
Your honor, I object to the use

43
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,427
of the media term "Clayface."

44
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,250
My client has a name. It is Ethan Bennett.

45
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,246
Objection sustained.

46
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,247
Eh... uh, both of them.

47
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,259
Please state your name and occupation for the record.

48
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:36,273
Strange. Professor Hugo Strange.

49
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:39,275
I'm a senior resident at Arkham Asylum

50
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:43,273
for the criminally insane.

51
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:46,284
Mr. Bennett was clearly psychologically traumatized

52
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:49,281
by our former patient, Joker

53
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:54,286
and by his own transformation.

54
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,281
Traumas he suffered in the line of duty?

55
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,294
'Precisely.'

56
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:02,293
'Temporary insanity, if you will.'

57
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:05,292
'I've since had many sessions with Ethan.'

58
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:07,292
'I cannot speak for his body'

59
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:13,318
but I am convinced he is now of completely sound mind.

60
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,300
I'm Dr. Mark Desmond

61
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:19,342
head of biomed at Wayne Industries.

62
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,314
<i>My team has run a battery of tests</i>

63
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,321
<i>over the last three months.</i>

64
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:27,311
<i>Though tissue samples were extracted</i>

65
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:28,327
<i>we've been unable to devise a cure</i>

66
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:30,316
<i>for Mr. Bennett's affliction.</i>

67
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,315
<i>However, we've learned that each time Bennett</i>

68
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,316
<i>uses his morphic abilities</i>

69
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,316
<i>his mutated genes self-replicate.</i>

70
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,336
<i>But those mutating cells quickly fell into remission</i>

71
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,338
from lack of use since Mr. Bennett's capture.

72
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,334
We at Wayne Industries believe

73
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:47,341
that Mr. Bennett's human side can remain stable

74
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:52,355
'as long as he continues to exercise mind over matter.'

75
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,340
I've known Ethan since high school.

76
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:58,336
He's a good man, and he's my best friend.

77
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,351
And do you trust him, Mr. Wayne, even now?

78
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,384
Like a brother.

79
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,345
I'm prepared to offer Ethan a job today

80
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,387
'as head of security for Wayne Industries.'

81
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,363
Ethan Bennett, I'm placing you on probation.

82
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:13,355
You're to continue your therapy

83
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,353
and refrain at all times

84
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:18,377
from the use of your so-called morphic abilities.

85
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:22,368
'You will also be subject to regular chemical testing'

86
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,363
'to ensure that you are obeying'

87
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:26,372
'the conditions of your probation.'

88
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,400
Huh!

89
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,413
Ethan, that's it. You're free to go.

90
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,381
First day, Ethan. You nervous?

91
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:44,390
I was a cop for six years, Bruce.

92
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:46,418
I think I can handle staring at a monitor.

93
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,401
'Whoa.'

94
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:54,437
Make that 350 monitors.

95
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,414
All the better to safeguard

96
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:02,409
our top-secret data, our research materials.

97
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:05,419
Hmm, not to mention millions of dollars' worth of modern art.

98
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:08,433
Mr. Wayne has quite the collection.

99
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,411
Ethan, this is Weber, the day shift supervisor

100
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,425
and our resident art critic.

101
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:15,429
He reports to you.

102
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,416
Great to have you aboard, sir.

103
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,432
Uh, thanks. And it's Ethan.

104
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,458
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

105
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:27,425
- Hey, must be nice. - Nice?

106
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,446
Yeah, having a billionaire buddy

107
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,472
you know, to fix your mistakes.

108
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:45,460
I suppose they've assigned you a new partner by now.

109
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:49,455
Well... not exactly.

110
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,453
I miss it, Yin. I miss the action, helping people.

111
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:54,470
The old protect and serve.

112
00:07:54,494 --> 00:07:57,457
Bennett, don't glamorize it.

113
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:59,460
The job took its toll on you.

114
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:00,525
It wasn't just a job, Yin.

115
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,479
It was my identity, my life, who I am.

116
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,472
- Was.. - 'Clayface!'

117
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,477
'They should never' have let him out!

118
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,497
That's him, isn't it?

119
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,481
I tell you, Yin

120
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,510
some days I wish I could just disappear.

121
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:25,485
Uh, looks like I'm a little short.

122
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,496
Do you think I can owe you 50 cents?

123
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,513
No can do.

124
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,528
Rojas?

125
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:45,533
Uh, go for it, bro.

126
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,533
Idiot! You wanna end up back in the cell?

127
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,561
All that work, all those months?

128
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,552
Ditching Rojas was kind of cool.

129
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,627
Gotta hold myself together.

130
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:09,538
That's it. Gotta keep busy.

131
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,572
Gotta remember who I am.

132
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:15,535
A daring high-rise gold robbery

133
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,547
committed by Joker.

134
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,555
I don't know how that clown got in here

135
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,550
and I'm not sure where he went.

136
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:24,547
He just stepped off the balcony and disappeared.

137
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:28,547
This is likely the beginning of yet another Joker crime spree.

138
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,565
The question is, will the crazy crime clown

139
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,583
'be stopped before someone gets hurt?'

140
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:37,575
Gotta remember..

141
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:40,581
Who I am.

142
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,573
Ho ho. Bennett, you're here early.

143
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,590
Happy to be working.

144
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,578
Mr. Bennett, I found you.

145
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:54,609
Time for your court-ordered test, sir.

146
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,605
Right with you, doc.

147
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,613
Fools' gold!

148
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:20,598
You're through, Joker!

149
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,605
Ah! Detective.

150
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:23,613
Or should I say..

151
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:25,618
Night watchman?

152
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,618
Oh, so you remember me now.

153
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,628
I never forget a face I've tormented.

154
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:31,654
Speaking of happy days..

155
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,646
Ha ha ha!

156
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:40,643
Wait! Stop!

157
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:47,626
Don't tell me these aren't spiffy clodhoppers!

158
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,636
Joker, listen..

159
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,644
To the sound of you going splat?

160
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:52,637
Great idea!

161
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:54,674
- No. - Ha ha ha!

162
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:01,670
No!

163
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:07,655
No.

164
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,651
Mmm. Think it goes with the shoes?

165
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:15,692
Splat Wowza! That's a splat!

166
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,662
Joker!

167
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,663
Detective Bennett!

168
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,670
You're Clayface?

169
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,668
You turned me into clay!

170
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,705
Funny. I was trying to turn you into dust!

171
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,674
I'm gonna chop you down to size!

172
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:37,713
Who you calling tall?

173
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:43,726
Hay-yay.

174
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:53,710
T-T-F-N.

175
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:55,728
Ta ta for now.

176
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,726
No!

177
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:02,742
Ugh.

178
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,732
You?

179
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,720
What are you doing? I almost had Joker.

180
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,724
Who almost had Joker?

181
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:15,738
'Aren't you taking a risk here, Bennett?'

182
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,760
It's not how it looks, Bats.

183
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,719
Clayface didn't track down Joker.

184
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:22,740
Ethan Bennett did. Clayface just...

185
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:24,732
Reared his ugly head?

186
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,728
Alright, alright. Something like that.

187
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:28,731
Look, Bats, I'm not headed for a meltdown.

188
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:29,746
This isn't about revenge.

189
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,750
It's about making sure what Joker did to me

190
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:35,758
never happens to anyone else. Can you understand that?

191
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,747
Go home, Bennett.

192
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:44,784
Leave Joker to me.

193
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:55,774
I'll cut right to it, Ethan.

194
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:58,757
Doctor Desmond showed me your test results.

195
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:01,770
There's some indication that you've been morphing again.

196
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,764
Is Desmond gonna bust my parole?

197
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:04,772
- 'Ethan... ' - Is he?

198
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:06,765
The results were inconclusive

199
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,785
and I convinced him not to be hasty.

200
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,784
But Ethan, your cells are active again.

201
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:13,772
If you keep this up, you could pass the point of no...

202
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:14,784
Bruce, I slipped.

203
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:16,789
For a second. It won't happen again.

204
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,785
I'm not speaking as your boss, Ethan.

205
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,779
I'm speaking as your friend.

206
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:21,795
We've both seen the news.

207
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,806
Joker's out there.

208
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,828
Yeah, I know.

209
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,816
Ah.

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,855
'Destiny.'

211
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:06,842
Wayne's pet freak. Huh.

212
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:09,863
Can't believe he reassigned me to the night shift.

213
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,848
The nighty-night shift.

214
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:17,875
Ugh.

215
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,881
Joker!

216
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:35,867
Don't know what it is, but I know what I like!

217
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:38,885
There's gold in them there hills!

218
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:46,908
Goin' up.

219
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:58,910
Beep beep beep.

220
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,898
'Joker!'

221
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,890
- Huh! - Clayface!

222
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,897
Just the do-gooder I was hoping to see.

223
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:17,925
I'll be the last do-gooder you'll ever see!

224
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,917
Let's dance, drippy.

225
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,910
Sorry, fellas..

226
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,932
But I have to cut in.

227
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,920
Batman <i>and Clayface?</i>

228
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:40,946
Hoo hoo! My cup runneth over!

229
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:45,930
Struggling with your inner demon again, Bennett?

230
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:46,941
Not this time.

231
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,941
The only spot in Wayne Industries

232
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,928
without security cameras..

233
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,930
Thought I might just get away with it.

234
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,942
Just didn't count on you getting here quite so fast, Bats.

235
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,953
My, you are good.

236
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,941
I'll just be going.

237
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:04,945
Clank Whoa! No fair!

238
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:05,960
Two against one?

239
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:09,952
We make a pretty good team, Bats.

240
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:10,961
Give it up, Bennett.

241
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:11,970
In your case, doing good

242
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,967
is an act of self-destruction.

243
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,960
Had a feeling you'd take the high road, Batman.

244
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:19,977
Guess it's time we settled our differences.

245
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,979
I'm not your enemy, Bennett.

246
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,975
You are the only one I see

247
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,977
standing between me and my freedom.

248
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,966
You have options.

249
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,968
Like prison or Arkham?

250
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,991
Hmm, I pick..

251
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,978
Eliminating witnesses!

252
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:37,977
Yes!

253
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,979
That's the clay talking, Bennett.

254
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:40,995
How do you know where Bennett ends

255
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,019
and Clayface begins?

256
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,026
Thud

257
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,032
clank.

258
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:59,006
Saw that coming!

259
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,032
Guess you'll have to learn a new trick, huh, Bats?

260
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,044
Clank.

261
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:09,041
Ah. Chip off the old block.

262
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,051
Ugh.

263
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:25,038
Go on, son. Take a little off the top.

264
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:26,042
Son?

265
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,037
I made you who you are. Said so yourself.

266
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:30,072
And from where I dangle

267
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,071
you make a better villain than vigilante.

268
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,046
Besides, crime pays more.

269
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,059
So come to papa.

270
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,055
Join team Joker!

271
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,074
You have a point!

272
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,051
But Clayface works alone!

273
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,076
Wait. What about my cut?

274
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:56,097
Bennett!

275
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,078
Who?

276
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,083
Clank.

277
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,094
Oh, they grow up so fast.

278
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:10,091
Hold it!

279
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,113
Whoa! Yin, you wouldn't shoot

280
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:16,085
your old partner, would you?

281
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,093
Didn't know you collected modern art.

282
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:21,081
What do you plan to do with it?

283
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,091
Melt it down.

284
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,102
You know, to jump-start my new life.

285
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:27,123
Bennett, give up. It's not too late.

286
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,103
Isn't it, Bats?

287
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:32,109
Look, here's the problem as I see it.

288
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:36,098
Being Ethan Bennett is hard, really hard.

289
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:39,108
Being Clayface is cake.

290
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,112
So say your good-byes.

291
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:44,134
This is the last you'll ever see of him.

292
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:53,113
Now step aside, or I'll mash you both..

293
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:56,146
Mash anyone who gets in my way!

294
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,123
Good to know.

295
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:00,151
You just made this a whole lot easier.

296
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:11,128
Didn't expect that from you, Yin.

297
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,174
I guess you do have

298
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,168
'a new partner.'

299
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,156
We've really lost him this time, haven't we, Wayne?

300
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,194
Ethan's past the point of no return.

301
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:40,188
'Now... only Clayface remains.'

302
