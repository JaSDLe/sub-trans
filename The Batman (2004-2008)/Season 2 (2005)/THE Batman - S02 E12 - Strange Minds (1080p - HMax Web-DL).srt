1
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:24,002
Hmm. Pizza.

2
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,026
Sounds like a plan.

3
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:34,031
'Lee n' Cavalo's.'

4
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:37,028
Hi. I'd like a veggie pizza. I have a coupon.

5
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:39,019
'For a free soda.'

6
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:42,035
'We'll be there in 30 seconds, or your pizza is a free.'

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,180
Don't you mean 30 minutes...

8
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,054
'Pizza delivery!'

9
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,061
Joker.

10
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,064
Here's your pizza!

11
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,068
And, as promised, the soda is free.

12
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:16,141
♪ The Batman ♪

13
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,218
'The costume worn onstage'

14
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:01,222
by the first-ever Pagliacci.

15
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,229
Worth its weight in gold thread

16
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:06,231
would you not say, Mr. Wayne?

17
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,226
Professor Strange, right?

18
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,241
Hugo Strange.

19
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:11,248
Call me Bruce.

20
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:13,247
Oh, congratulations, by the way.

21
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,241
'Chief of psychiatry at Arkham.'

22
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,253
Ah, my promotion. Yes. Yes.

23
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:20,239
Thank you. Thank you.

24
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,256
But I'm equally excited about my project

25
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,265
with your Wayne industries.

26
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:30,252
I'm afraid I'm not quite up to speed on the particulars.

27
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:32,257
Oh, it's a revolutionary device

28
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,259
which will truly open doors

29
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:37,263
to the criminally insane mind.

30
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:42,296
A subject which I find endlessly fascinating, Bruce.

31
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:50,283
Oh, my.

32
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:53,306
- It's the Joker! - Let's get out of here!

33
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,287
Just what I've always wanted.

34
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,306
Fancy pants.

35
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,292
An escaped patient on the loose?

36
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:09,300
- Doc? - I'm a tad embarrassed, Bruce.

37
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,314
Bruce?

38
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,299
Well, what a coin-ki-dink.

39
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,339
I've been wanting to discuss the Arkham diet with you.

40
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,327
Too many nuts!

41
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:30,332
Aah!

42
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:44,367
Fascinating. Like watching two sides of the same coin.

43
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,369
I never pegged you for an opera buff, Joker.

44
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,344
As any opera buff will tell you

45
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:53,333
it ain't over till the fat lady sings.

46
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,376
Or, in this case

47
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,372
my lovely diva Detective Yin.

48
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,376
Yin, do you read me? Detective Yin.

49
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,391
Where am I?

50
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:21,383
What?

51
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,395
Joker, let me out!

52
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:29,370
'Joker? Joker!'

53
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,398
'Let me out of here!'

54
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,421
Talk, Joker.

55
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,396
Well, you see, I've always wanted to stage my own opera.

56
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,384
All I needed was the right suit and a leading lady.

57
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:48,398
You look like you could really hit the low notes.

58
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:50,388
Wanna sing backup?

59
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:51,408
Where is she?

60
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,407
Somewhere in a box

61
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:56,400
set to spring free in eight hours

62
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:59,442
with a really big pop.

63
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,418
That is, unless you let me waltz out of here.

64
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,405
I don't negotiate with psychos.

65
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,410
As I tried to explain, Chief Rojas.

66
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,422
Joker will never voluntarily divulge.

67
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,428
Detective Yin's whereabouts, never.

68
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:16,440
At least, not in time to save her.

69
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,462
Ooh, headshrinker in the house.

70
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:22,764
So what do you suggest, professor?

71
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,440
I have developed a device that allows its user

72
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:29,438
to tap directly into a patient's mind

73
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:32,473
'like a two-way radio transmission.'

74
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,447
- You gotta be kidding me. - Hardly.

75
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,443
The technology is untested and therefore risky.

76
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:43,457
But I am willing to volunteer.

77
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,460
And what makes you so sure Joker will be willing to cooperate?

78
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,457
Another voice in my head?

79
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,461
The more the merrier!

80
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:54,453
If clown-boy likes it, I don't.

81
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:56,475
What alternative do we have

82
00:07:56,499 --> 00:08:00,470
to save Detective Yin?

83
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,468
Ugh.

84
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,488
Set it up.

85
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,475
Sir?

86
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,494
It's the Wayne industries prototype of Strange's device.

87
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:21,486
Fully operational, I take it?

88
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,500
Professor Strange may mean well

89
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:24,485
but I think the Batman's had more

90
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,630
field experience with Joker.

91
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,492
We use Batwave to jack into Arkham server

92
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,500
where we can piggyback Strange's frequency.

93
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:32,509
And enter Joker's crazed cranium

94
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,537
where you shall somehow uncover Yin's location.

95
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,503
- Somehow. - If I may say, sir.

96
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,513
This is positively daft.

97
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:45,531
You could be risking your own sanity.

98
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:48,543
System's ready.

99
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
You may begin.

100
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,541
Proceed.

101
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:19,553
I already have, professor.

102
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,554
Well, then you've done something wrong.

103
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,582
I'll check it myself.

104
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,576
Well, this isn't my machine.

105
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,576
Welcome to my head.

106
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:40,602
It works! I'm inside your mind!

107
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,570
That's right, egghead.

108
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:43,576
And if you think you can find

109
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,582
where I'm hiding Detective Yin

110
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:48,586
step right up and explore the insanity!

111
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,594
Three shows nightly!

112
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,599
Joker's childhood

113
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:11,593
the inevitable key to his mental state.

114
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:13,595
'Little boy! Come here!'

115
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,601
'I have questions to ask of you.'

116
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,607
He didn't even ask about Yin-in-the-box.

117
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,630
What's with that?

118
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,607
I've captured the frequency, Master Bruce.

119
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,628
Send me in.

120
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:54,673
Thud.

121
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,679
Gotham?

122
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,667
'Joker's Gotham.'

123
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:15,653
Egad! A Batman in my belfry!

124
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:16,674
Where are you keeping Yin?

125
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:18,666
Howling at the moon, eh?

126
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,672
I thought I was the crazy one.

127
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,670
Tell me where she is, Joker.

128
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:25,671
Or I'll see to it you never leave Arkham.

129
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:27,669
Make yourself at home, Batty.

130
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,705
Just watch out for the loose screws.

131
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,709
You better bolt!

132
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:49,722
Help! Help!

133
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,703
- Psych! - What ma said!

134
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,698
Enough mind games, Joker.

135
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,708
Tell me where you have Yin hidden now!

136
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,733
I'll never talk.

137
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,717
<i>Joker won't consciously talk.</i>

138
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:13,749
<i>I need to ply his subconscious mind for clues, but where?</i>

139
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,747
Joker's idea factory?

140
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,780
"Y" for Yin?

141
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,768
Ooh!

142
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,760
No, "Y" for yucks.

143
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:51,759
Let me guess. You're looking for the detective.

144
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:52,763
You're..

145
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,760
The only shadow of his former self

146
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:56,762
left in this crazy place.

147
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:57,799
It's my day job.

148
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,798
What I really want is to make people laugh.

149
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:04,769
Where is she?

150
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:05,779
That's top-secret.

151
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,773
You don't know what he'd do to me.

152
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:09,778
Her life depends on it.

153
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,785
Wrong department.

154
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:14,777
You want current schemes, around the corner to your...

155
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,807
'Now what did we discuss about giving away family secrets?'

156
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:32,833
Water's warm, Batman! Dive in!

157
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,821
' "Current schemes."'

158
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,820
'Better hurry, Batman.'

159
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:49,831
'Yin's running out of time.'

160
00:13:57,847 --> 00:13:59,832
And how did you cope with this lack of attention

161
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,856
from your parents?

162
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,859
The Batman?

163
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,846
How did you manage to get here?

164
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,875
I'm the only one with the means of...

165
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,835
I'm searching for Detective Yin

166
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,845
like yourself.

167
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,855
You're putting yourself at great risk.

168
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,848
Clearly, you possess a deep-rooted need to rescue.

169
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,862
Focus, professor. Yin's running out of time.

170
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,860
A very strong need.

171
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:30,856
'Could it stem from a past trauma'

172
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,866
'perhaps someone you once failed to rescue?'

173
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,861
'This is an outrage!'

174
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,900
In my head, I'm the headliner!

175
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,871
I demand to be center stage

176
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,898
so analyze this!

177
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:50,871
'So you're a shrink.'

178
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:53,909
'Tell me, why do I cross the road?'

179
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:01,891
'It's showtime!'

180
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:04,918
Joker said he wanted to stage his own opera.

181
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:22,932
'Oh, Batman, help me! Help me!'

182
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,913
I'm trapped, but I don't know where

183
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,909
and my time's running out.

184
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,921
Uuh..

185
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:33,955
I'm comin', Yinnie!

186
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,965
'Ow! That's gotta hurt!'

187
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:56,978
Your need to rescue is so dominant, Batman

188
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,953
that, uh, failure is bound to make you cuckoo.

189
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:03,984
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

190
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,984
Enough, Joker! Where's Yin?

191
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:18,990
I said, "Where's Yin?"

192
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,008
You're dancing in a hornets' nest, fella.

193
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,984
How many Jokers does it take to screw in a light bulb?

194
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:42,014
Wouldn't know. They're too busy loosening Batman's screws!

195
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:52,033
Ah..

196
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,024
<i>Save me, Batman.</i>

197
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:06,036
His brainwave activity is growing frenetic.

198
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:13,046
Oh, dear. He's going mad.

199
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,041
Master Bruce.

200
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,064
'Master Bruce!'

201
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,038
Master Bruce, please snap out of it.

202
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,075
You must come out of there at once!

203
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:40,076
I won't fail!

204
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:49,054
'There's no point in resisting, Batman.'

205
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:53,058
In my brain I pull the stings.

206
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:55,060
You may control your mind, Joker

207
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:58,078
but I won't let you control mine!

208
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:02,068
Tell me where you're keeping her.

209
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:04,065
Nope! I'm not singin'!

210
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,067
Can't make me.

211
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,077
I'll make you sing

212
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:11,076
if I have to turn your mind inside out!

213
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,098
If you really want to get inside my head, Batman..

214
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,084
I'll take you so far in

215
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:21,106
you'll never find your way out.

216
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:29,092
'Batman, is that you?'

217
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,088
Detective Yin.

218
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,110
Why didn't you save me, Batman?

219
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:36,128
Welcome to my world.

220
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,110
You're finally where you belong.

221
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,135
Arkham!

222
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,106
A pity you went through all that trouble

223
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,121
to get here, Batman

224
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:51,119
because now you're in deep

225
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,154
and there's no way out.

226
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,121
<i>Strange referred to this</i>

227
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,132
<i>as a two-way transmission.</i>

228
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,156
<i>Just need to find..</i>

229
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,143
<i>The way out.</i>

230
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,148
Huh?

231
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,138
Aah!

232
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:17,155
It's over? I hate abrupt endings.

233
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:22,165
- Was she there? - Yes, she certainly was.

234
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,159
No. It can't be!

235
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:28,146
Thank you, professor.

236
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,153
I understand you saved my life.

237
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:32,164
No! You couldn't have found her!

238
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:34,162
I did not sing!

239
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,157
'No, not consciously.'

240
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,164
But while your mind was preoccupied with the Batman

241
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,177
I was able to glean the truth

242
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:44,170
from your subconscious.

243
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:45,183
All you did was sing.

244
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:49,183
All those sad clowns, the arias.

245
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:53,185
You had opera on the brain.

246
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,216
Well, duh!

247
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,177
You pulled Yin out from under

248
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,214
the Gotham symphony hall stage didn't you?

249
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,212
Wait a minute.

250
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,236
Thanks for that.

251
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,217
What?

252
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:23,207
Where are we?

253
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,228
In my mind.

254
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,227
Aah!

255
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:33,220
Master Bruce?

256
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:36,220
Are you of sound mind?

257
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:38,249
I know where he's keeping Yin.

258
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,226
'It's showtime!'

259
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,227
'ten..'

260
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,270
Somebody, please..

261
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,237
'...8... 7... 6...'

262
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,248
'...5..'

263
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:56,235
'...4..'

264
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,249
'...3..'

265
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,263
'...2..'

266
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:07,244
So what took you?

267
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,279
It's been a crazy night.

268
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:21,263
'The tears of a clown.'

269
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,275
The rage behind the mirror.

270
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,274
Tonight, I merely glimpsed.

271
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,286
Joker's peculiar form of madness.

272
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,276
So many more roads to cross

273
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,293
'before I can get to..'

274
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:38,300
'...the other side.'

275
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,347
