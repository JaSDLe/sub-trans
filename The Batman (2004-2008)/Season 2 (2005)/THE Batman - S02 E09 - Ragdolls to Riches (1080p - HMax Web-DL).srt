1
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:10,019
'Hello, kitty.'

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,003
The only known animation cel in existence

3
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:19,029
from 1923's "Kitty-Cat Follies."

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,034
Cute, cuddly, and priceless.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,038
Hiss.

6
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:39,061
Did someone say cute and cuddly?

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,047
- Who are you? - I'm Ragdoll.

8
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:40,108
♪ The Batman ♪

9
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:57,126
You, my minx, are a doll.

10
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:03,111
Might we have this little frivolity in common?

11
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:05,113
It's fate. It's destiny.

12
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:09,137
It's feline, so it's mine.

13
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,157
Now, crawl back to your toy box, floppy.

14
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,166
Skipped charm school, did we, precious?

15
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,162
- Gotcha. - Whoa.

16
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,149
Hm, the price tag on this pup

17
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:40,148
might make a cat person of me yet.

18
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,142
'After tonight..'

19
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,164
I guarantee you won't be a bat person.

20
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:48,175
The Batman.

21
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:52,175
Competition, eh?

22
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh! My arm!

23
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,198
Neat, huh?

24
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,218
Screech.

25
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,228
'Toodles.'

26
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:57,222
'I lost my precious animation cel'

27
00:03:57,246 --> 00:04:00,225
'to that triple-jointed contortionist.'

28
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:02,235
meow.

29
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:06,226
If Ragdoll ever plays in my sandbox again

30
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,262
I'll claw the stuffing out of him.

31
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,266
Meow meow meow.

32
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,253
Okay, come on, Selina.

33
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:18,276
Cat always land on their feet.

34
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,273
Time to prowl for fresh prey.

35
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,302
'Old money.'

36
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,322
'Older money.'

37
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:03,306
Oh. Hm.

38
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:13,315
New money. Me-ow.

39
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:21,335
- One water with.. - One water with.. Oh.

40
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:28,309
Uh, two waters with lemon, please.

41
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,320
I wonder what else we have in common, Miss..

42
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:33,317
Kyle. Selina Kyle.

43
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,324
- I'm Bruce... - Wayne, I know.

44
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:38,322
But who knew Gotham's most eligible bachelor

45
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,321
had such a grip.

46
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,350
You're not so bad yourself.

47
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,343
Your grip.

48
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,346
A firm handshake is a must in my line of work.

49
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,373
- Which is? - Fundraising, for charities.

50
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,753
Ah, you find wealthy philanthropists

51
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,336
such as myself and spend our money.

52
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,342
- Only on good causes. - Define, "Good."

53
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,385
Over dinner. Your place?

54
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,353
I'll phone my butler and have him whip something up.

55
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:09,378
Yummy. I'll grab my coat.

56
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:15,375
One of those with lots of twists.

57
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:22,383
'Perfect.'

58
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:33,396
'Wow, you're really into dog art.'

59
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,387
You like it, huh.

60
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:38,420
- It belonged to my father. - Dessert, Ms. Kyle?

61
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,387
Your famous nachos will be hard to beat, Alfred.

62
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,399
Mind if I desert you boys for a minute?

63
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:48,425
The ladies' lounge is down the hall to your right.

64
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:53,396
Miss Kyle is most pleasant, sir.

65
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,408
More importantly she's intimate with all of Gotham's charities.

66
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,432
You are made for each other.

67
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,429
Saved by the bell.

68
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:17,428
'Everything but cats.'

69
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:19,433
Why is it the only man in Gotham

70
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:22,463
with my sense of style is Batman.

71
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,471
A delivery? At this hour?

72
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,476
Special delivery.

73
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:37,479
Oh!

74
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,470
Oh, an original Nolbino.

75
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,494
Hello.

76
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,473
The looks on your faces.

77
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:16,501
Priceless! Perhaps I'll snatch those too.

78
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,821
Sir, considering the mixed company

79
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,495
perhaps Ragdoll's best left for the proper authorities.

80
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,500
Just need to make sure Ragdoll's reachable.

81
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,505
Buddy, I suggest you leave the heirloom behind.

82
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:33,505
And I suggest you not to play with dolls.

83
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,531
I-i-it's cool. Just take it.

84
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,504
You won't get away with this.

85
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:46,510
Oh, aren't you're a tigress.

86
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,531
You have no idea.

87
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:53,556
Toodles.

88
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:59,539
Wow! I, uh, I better call the police.

89
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,540
Well, perhaps Miss Kyle would like a spot of tea?

90
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,529
You know, for the nerves.

91
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:06,525
Why don't you brew some for Bruce?

92
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:08,556
He looks like he could use it.

93
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,573
Goodnight, Alfred.

94
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,580
Oh, if only you knew the real Bruce Wayne.

95
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:40,589
From Ragdoll to riches.

96
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,567
What're you doing here?

97
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:47,571
Funny, I was about to ask you.

98
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:50,595
Clank clank.

99
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:02,613
Sorry, handsome. Ragdoll's mine.

100
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:10,616
Gotham ain't big enough for the both of us, Raggedy.

101
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:15,593
Oh, kitten has claws.

102
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:16,608
Ooh!

103
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,619
Kitten has a whip.

104
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,637
Meow Ooh!

105
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:40,647
Now, we're even. Toodles.

106
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,664
So kitten likes to play rough.

107
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,659
About time I ended this game.

108
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,648
Yes, puddy, I know it's horrid.

109
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,682
But you know, the thrill of the hunt

110
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,649
is far more important to me than the payoff.

111
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:07,654
Too bad Bruce Wayne's belongings don't thrill me at all.

112
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,666
'In local events, billionaire Bruce Wayne has announced'

113
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,664
he will open his most famous property

114
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:15,670
'the Gotham clock tower for a rare public tour.'

115
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:18,658
Well, speak of Mr. Boring.

116
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:21,680
Built over 150 years ago by Wayne's great-grandfather

117
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:25,670
the tower remains the source of many legends.

118
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:26,709
The cat's eyes.

119
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,670
And what of Frankie Scolacci's Cat's Eyes?

120
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:32,676
The emeralds that mobsters supposedly

121
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,682
hid somewhere here back in the 1930s?

122
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:38,694
Well, the tower's been searched dozens of times.

123
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:42,680
But who knows? Could be we missed a nook.

124
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:46,710
Suddenly old Bruce is lookin' pretty good.

125
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,709
Catwoman won't resist the bait.

126
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:54,732
And Ragdoll won't resist getting even with Catwoman.

127
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:03,704
'The interior of the clock'

128
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:06,715
consists of 341 moving parts

129
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,710
including these giant gears

130
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:11,710
which were forged from over 20 tons of iron.

131
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:13,745
Now, if you'll follow me..

132
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,741
Dog art collector and clock expert.

133
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,744
Well, aren't you just the whole package, Bruce Wayne?

134
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:41,740
Selina, I'm, I'm sorry about the other night.

135
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,742
Don't apologize for being burgled.

136
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,763
Apologize for not calling.

137
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,765
I've been distracted.

138
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:50,766
Bruce, don't tell me you've been courting

139
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,755
another charity fundraiser.

140
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:56,774
No, Selina, a whole different breed of person

141
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,781
has been on my mind.

142
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,828
Rattle rattle rattle.

143
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,805
What do we have here?

144
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,840
No, they're not in here.

145
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:46,816
Listen up, Raggy.

146
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,808
If those emeralds are here, they're mine.

147
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:51,853
'I can't leave you two alone for a second.'

148
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,850
Whoa!

149
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,842
Tick tock, Batman.

150
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:19,875
When it's your time, it's your time.

151
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,874
Save yourself, Batman.

152
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:43,894
Lose the mask, I would.

153
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,897
Screech.

154
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:53,916
What? And ruin his mysterious allure.

155
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,888
Thanks.

156
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,882
You may wanna think twice next time

157
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:58,921
you consider tyin' me up.

158
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,923
Whoa!

159
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,895
Really irons out the kinks.

160
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,934
Hmm. Oh, and lookie what I found.

161
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,900
No.

162
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,934
Bet these will fetch six figures.

163
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,918
If it's money you want, rob a bank.

164
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:30,940
Those emeralds are two of a kind, ragface.

165
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,914
Speaking of, three of us, two of these

166
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,958
I guess we'll split them one way.

167
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:04,987
Hey.

168
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:07,987
Hey!

169
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:19,992
Hey.

170
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,027
Ha!

171
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:04,019
The reach of Ragdoll is quicker than the..

172
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:06,048
Eye.

173
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,048
Wa-wow.

174
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,029
- Finders keepers. - They don't belong to you.

175
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,035
Who then? Bruce Wayne?

176
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,035
We are in his clock tower.

177
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,026
Don't bring him between us, handsome.

178
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,046
Mm, I love a man in uniform.

179
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,075
Carry on.

180
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,088
That's tight.

181
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:57,089
Help me out here and I-I'll split these with you.

182
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:00,076
I don't accept handouts.

183
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,092
But I'll always take what I've earned.

184
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:07,080
Come on, don't be a sour puss, handsome.

185
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:09,077
The cat's eyes were a legend, right?

186
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,088
No one will know they're missing

187
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:13,112
because they are not even supposed to be here.

188
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:20,113
Um-mh. Not even one?

189
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:25,127
Argh!

190
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:31,130
I'll get my cat's eyes.

191
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,137
Even if I have to claw them from Bruce Wayne's fingertips.

192
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,142
Uh.

193
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,129
Little help?

194
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:51,122
'Because you love my cooking, madam.'

195
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:55,116
Ooh, the famous Pennyworth nachos.

196
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,134
Now, you've been quite the danger magnet

197
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:58,131
these days, Bruce Wayne.

198
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:02,120
Clock tower incident's all over the news.

199
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:03,305
Actually there was an upshot.

200
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,142
The found emeralds were bequeathed to me.

201
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,125
Oh, let me guess.

202
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,550
You displayed the cat's eyes besides

203
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,173
your cherished velvet painting of dogs playing poker.

204
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,140
Nope, I sold them..

205
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:18,136
'...for 100 G's.'

206
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,138
And the Wayne foundation would be honored to have you donate

207
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:24,164
the proceeds to the charity you feel could use it most.

208
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:31,170
I can't tell you what a... thrill this is.

209
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,168
- 'Sir.' - 'I'm on hold with the bank.'

210
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:38,199
Oh, really, Master Bruce?

211
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,161
I think this sudden distrust of Miss Kyle

212
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:43,161
is terribly misplaced.

213
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:45,172
I have a weird feeling that's all.

214
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:48,191
Selina left here in such a mood.

215
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,171
It was? To whom?

216
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:52,213
I see. Yup.

217
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,179
- Thank you very much. - Well..

218
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,192
Well, Selina donated the check after all

219
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:01,185
to the Gotham pet shelter network.

220
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,197
Intriguing choice for a woman

221
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,226
who doesn't seem to care much for dog art.

222
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,201
Selina Kyle is a fascinating creature.

223
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,228
'Could be there's more to her than meets the eye.'
