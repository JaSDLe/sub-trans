1
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:11,001
Let's brighten up the brownstones

2
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,031
with some Joker White.

3
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:28,008
'Tweet, tweet.'

4
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,046
'Comin' through!'

5
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,047
Black and white, the colors of Penguin.

6
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:42,039
No!

7
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,043
This is my turf, birdbrain!

8
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:47,040
The West Side belongs to me, Joker

9
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,059
and you're violating my airspace!

10
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:58,061
You've derailed my dirigible!

11
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,060
Spring forward.

12
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,075
- Huh? - Fall back!

13
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:23,069
I proclaim this street Rictus Rue!

14
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:27,091
It's my 'hood, and it's Penguinsburg!

15
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:33,079
I prefer the ring of..

16
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,110
Enigma Avenue.

17
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,078
Who are you?

18
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:43,107
Call me The Riddler.

19
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:45,088
Riddler, eh?

20
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:46,105
You stealing my <i>shtick?</i>

21
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:50,107
I do riddles. I don't tell jokes.

22
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,092
Well, Gotham ain't big enough for the two of us, skinny

23
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,103
let alone three!

24
00:01:55,127 --> 00:02:00,105
Precisely why I propose we settle this with a wager.

25
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,119
What's the game?

26
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,145
The first to capture and unmask

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,123
our greatest common foe wins Gotham.

28
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:10,113
No matter who wins..

29
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:14,150
The biggest loser is The Batman.

30
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:12,200
♪ The Batman ♪

31
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,201
'A turf war continues to plague our city'

32
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:31,202
as Joker, Penguin and, perhaps, even Riddler

33
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:34,207
clash to become Gotham's premier crime boss.

34
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:37,240
Gotham PD has of yet been unable to restore order.

35
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,199
Chief Rojas, are you expecting The Batman to get involved?

36
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:44,208
The way I see it, The Bat is the root problem.

37
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:47,210
Gotham never had lunatics like these till he showed up!

38
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:48,220
Mark my words.

39
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:50,220
We're going to take down these villains

40
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,254
and The Bat.

41
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,221
I do hope to see the day you no longer have to flee the law

42
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,232
you work so hard to help.

43
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,228
Well, I don't think Gotham PD

44
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:06,229
is gonna be deputizing The Bat anytime soon, Alfred.

45
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,240
Gotham's new commissioner of police had this to say.

46
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:13,238
Gotham is in the midst of a serious crime wave.

47
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,243
'And with criminals like these'

48
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:17,243
it may be time for Gotham PD

49
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,260
to start thinking outside the box.

50
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,254
James Gordon has loomed large in your life, Master Bruce.

51
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,267
Perhaps, thinking outside the box

52
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,295
'might include going public with his support of The Batman?'

53
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:41,264
We're gonna show the commish what Gotham PD Is made of.

54
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:42,276
And that means not standing by

55
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,272
while The Bat nails these crazies for us

56
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,265
'not this time!'

57
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,274
I want you all to step up efforts

58
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,273
to find Joker, Penguin, Riddler

59
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,305
because that's where you'll find The Bat!

60
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,310
- Detective Yin. - Chief's pulling out all stops.

61
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,295
You need to lay low.

62
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,296
Not with the gruesome threesome running loose.

63
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,296
'Then we need to strategize.'

64
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,301
'Meet me at the abandoned cannery on Alden Street.'

65
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:21,319
Okay. Give me an hour.

66
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:23,321
Well, that explains a lot!

67
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:28,306
I was starting to wonder why you're always sneaking away.

68
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,451
You won't need this anymore.

69
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:33,354
Crash.

70
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
Don't worry, Yin.

71
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:39,328
Your little powwow will go right ahead as planned

72
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:42,354
but first, your badge.

73
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,356
Vroom.

74
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:02,376
Detective Yin?

75
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,376
- Detective. - 'Don't move!'

76
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,398
Nice work, Yin.

77
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,383
'Stay put, Bat..'

78
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:36,398
That is, unless you want the shock of a lifetime.

79
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,421
Gotham PD beat us to the punch?

80
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,422
You mean, nobody wins this contest?

81
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:50,433
Until the cowl comes off

82
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,406
the game is on.

83
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,407
Radio the commish. Let him know Chief Angel Rojas

84
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:03,431
'is about to meet the man behind The Bat.'

85
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,423
Well, Bat, you gonna remove the mask

86
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,438
or do I have to come over there and do it for you?

87
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:22,461
Stun him!

88
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,890
- 'Somebody get the lights!' - 'Huh?'

89
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,455
Don't let him get away!

90
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,470
Get those lights on! Now!

91
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:50,473
- How'd you do that? - I didn't.

92
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:57,472
Uh, I just want you to know

93
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:59,463
that I didn't have anything to do with..

94
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,495
I know.

95
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:05,480
The whole city's gone dark.

96
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,503
Not that I'm complaining.

97
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,481
Riddler.

98
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,516
He must have hacked into Gotham's central grid.

99
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,503
There!

100
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,505
Got any ideas?

101
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:23,518
Oh!

102
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:33,505
My career in law enforcement is so over with.

103
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,519
Don't bet on it.

104
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,534
That's where we'll find Riddler.

105
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,616
I never thought I'd be on this end of a police chase.

106
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:51,554
Vroom

107
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:05,567
screech

108
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,566
vroom.

109
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,536
Why is Riddler so interested in being our guardian angel?

110
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,539
Riddler doesn't wanna share me with Gotham PD.

111
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:19,574
And he may or may not wanna share me with anyone else.

112
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:42,595
Screech Eh?

113
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,570
Mind the gap, Penguie! Ha-ha!

114
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:50,608
Mind you're yap, screw-loose!

115
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,610
This is the source of the blackout?

116
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:25,620
It's a transmitter.

117
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:28,632
Riddler routed a signal to lead us here.

118
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,614
So we play again, detectives.

119
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:38,626
- Where are you, Riddler? - You'll soon find out.

120
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,622
Let's just say, cops and robbers don't mix.

121
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:47,626
And from where I sit, neither do these two things.

122
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,635
Riddler shmiddler!

123
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,645
The game belongs to Penguin!

124
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:55,660
Back off, tubby. Batsy is mine!

125
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,666
Oh, no, you don't!

126
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,675
'Look out!'

127
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:21,661
And the game moves to a swift finish..

128
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,695
Riddler's favor.

129
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,711
Splash.

130
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,689
Mind yourselves.

131
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,698
The Batman and his little helper

132
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:55,731
are sure to be in a sour mood.

133
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,731
What?

134
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:04,746
Hey!

135
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:10,734
Boys, eliminate the competition.

136
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,713
Something tells me

137
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:18,760
we're soon to receive a special guest.

138
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,743
'Riddler hacked into Gotham's power grid'

139
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,729
'through the transatlantic fiber-optic cable.'

140
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:29,741
But how'd he splice in?

141
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,730
The cable runs along the ocean floor.

142
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:33,739
Riddler's riddle.

143
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:36,742
He sits near two things that don't mix

144
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,755
oil and water.

145
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,738
Uh, okay. We're on the water.

146
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:43,771
'And heading for an offshore oil-drilling platform.'

147
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:49,749
We have our Bat.

148
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:52,764
Let's move, people! I want these boats ready to launch now!

149
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,768
'You're a busy man, chief.'

150
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,765
First, I receive word you're unmasking The Batman then, poof.

151
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:01,783
You're on the docks sending half our force to sea.

152
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,783
Commissioner Gordon, we sighted The Bat

153
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,769
heading east in an unlicensed watercraft.

154
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:08,782
He has a fugitive in tow!

155
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:12,783
So could be The Batman's on the I am..

156
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:14,772
Or could be

157
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:17,776
he's onto something about this pickle we're in.

158
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,780
You're not saying you want a <i>vigilante to do police work?</i>

159
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,798
I'm saying we need to be smart about this.

160
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,788
If we stop The Batman now

161
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,817
we may never find out where he's headed.

162
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,825
Whoosh.

163
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,809
- Plan? - Keep a lookout.

164
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,813
Oh. I thought I was your partner.

165
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,828
But you're not my sidekick.

166
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:50,813
You're a lousy host.

167
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:53,850
And you two are lousy competition.

168
00:13:57,848 --> 00:13:58,834
You know, Jokester

169
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:02,851
maybe there is enough Gotham for two to share.

170
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,847
Now, what was that you were saying..

171
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:26,878
About the quality of the competition?

172
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,893
'No more games.'

173
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:34,894
You want me..

174
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,884
Here I am.

175
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:03,883
What kind of bird packs a wallop?

176
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:04,921
A crane.

177
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,926
Thud.

178
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:17,924
There's nowhere you can go that I can't reach!

179
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:33,938
In my book, keeping a lookout means watching your back.

180
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:54,965
Yaah!

181
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,987
Uh? Foul play!

182
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:15,978
Beep 'Riddler's remote control system.'

183
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:17,986
Bye-bye!

184
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:22,999
Yaah!

185
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:42,014
Uh-oh.

186
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,018
What?

187
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,013
Lights out, Riddler.

188
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,017
I'm the last man standing!

189
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,028
The game belongs to me!

190
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,072
Thought you could use some good press.

191
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:03,104
Well done, sir.

192
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:18,089
I surrender.

193
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:21,086
I promise to save a cell for The Bat

194
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,092
right next to yours.

195
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:26,089
I'm not so sure this is a good idea, Chief Rojas.

196
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:29,087
Detective Yin aided and abetted a known criminal

197
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,108
resisted arrest and fled police custody!

198
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:34,114
That's one way to look at it.

199
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:36,133
'Here's another way.'

200
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:41,117
Detective Yin helped to bring in Gotham's three most wanted.

201
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:44,106
It seems to me, the department's had its share

202
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,103
'of bad press lately.'

203
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,145
Do you really think it's wise to arrest a hero?

204
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:13,174
- Nice work, detective. - Thank you, commissioner.

205
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,161
Detective Yin informs me the pager you supplied to her

206
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:37,171
is on the blink.

207
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:40,159
What's on your mind, commissioner?

208
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:43,171
You know, I feel chasing bats is counterproductive

209
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,165
not to mention, a waste of police resources.

210
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:49,171
Thanks to all of your efforts, Batman the time is finally right

211
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:52,180
to take our alliance to the next step.

212
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,188
Commissioner?

213
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:56,193
Good press sometimes goes beyond the law.

214
00:19:56,217 --> 00:20:00,194
The hearts and minds of all of Gotham are behind you.

215
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:03,183
I do my best work from the shadows.

216
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,184
That won't need to change.

217
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,191
All I ask is that you help me make Gotham

218
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,231
a safe place for my daughter to grow up in.

219
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,240
For your daughter, then.

220
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,279
