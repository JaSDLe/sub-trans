1
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:14,002
Sorry. It was a one-time offense, man.

2
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:16,023
Won't happen again!

3
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,024
Come on, man. All I did was jaywalk.

4
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:28,014
Stop! No! Please!

5
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:30,043
'No! No!'

6
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,037
whirr.

7
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,083
I'm the Batman!

8
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,102
Vroom.

9
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:57,126
♪ The Batman ♪

10
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,131
'Tonight all of Gotham'

11
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:15,131
again finds itself terrorized by Joker.

12
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,122
Only this time, instead of breaking the law

13
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:20,121
he's enforcing it.

14
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,128
'Donning the costume and mocking the methods'

15
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:24,140
of his constant rival The Batman.

16
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:27,169
Joker has inexplicably turned to fighting crime.

17
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,130
The crazed catch?

18
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,136
'It seems the offenses he targets'

19
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,134
'barely qualify as crimes, at all.'

20
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,143
'And as Kimberly Smith, the 78-year-old'

21
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,146
'grandmother of ten, learned after absentmindedly driving'

22
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,144
'for three blocks with her turn signal flashing'

23
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:44,142
'while the crimes may be minor'

24
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,183
'Joker's punishment of them is anything but..'

25
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,168
Imitation <i>is the sincerest</i> form of flattery.

26
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:54,173
But why do you suppose the tribute, Master Bruce?

27
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,167
Cheap knockoff is more like it.

28
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,157
But what troubles me most

29
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,170
is that my antidote failed to cure Joker's jaywalker.

30
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,176
A new strain of Joker gas.

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,188
How very ghastly indeed!

32
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,188
Whoosh Huh? J-Joker?

33
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:22,220
Where?

34
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,203
I don't know what you're after but you will be stopped.

35
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:32,193
The only thing I'm after, mayor, are the bad guys.

36
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:33,618
Then how do you justify what you did

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,214
to three of Gotham PD's finest today?

38
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:38,212
'And for what, speeding?'

39
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:41,199
'It was a police chase.'

40
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,229
No one's above the law.

41
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:48,225
"Bill for services rendered?"

42
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,229
"One million dollars." What?

43
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:55,220
Crime-fighting ain't charity work, you know.

44
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,221
And if the city doesn't comply?

45
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:00,263
Then Gotham pays... dearly!

46
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,249
Ahem! Sorry.

47
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:10,271
I must say, mayor, of all the scum I've taken down so far

48
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,273
it was your <i>wife</i> who disappointed me the most.

49
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,249
My wife? Sheila?

50
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,254
What have you done to Sheila?

51
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:22,259
Eleven items at a ten-item grocery checkout.

52
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,268
She had it coming.

53
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,268
- Huh? - Ha ha ha!

54
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:31,267
Sheila.

55
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,273
'Sheila!'

56
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,303
- 'Well, well, well.' - Huh?

57
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:46,276
Graffiti!

58
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,279
That's a pretty serious offense, girls.

59
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,289
But that's why I became a crime fighter.

60
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:54,290
To take out garbage like you.

61
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:56,306
- Unh! - Ah!

62
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,289
The costume party's over, Joker.

63
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,284
Joker? Didn't you hear?

64
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:06,305
The clown prince of crime's checked out.

65
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,288
He just couldn't take anymore.

66
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,304
'Couldn't take The Batman.'

67
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,300
Always there to thwart his latest scheme.

68
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:16,317
Well, it was really starting to drive him mad.

69
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,313
But then Joker thought

70
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:20,307
if he couldn't beat The Bat

71
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,335
he'd <i>be The Bat.</i>

72
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,314
Then Gotham has one Batman too many.

73
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:29,312
Which means one of us has gotta go.

74
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,340
My thoughts exactly.

75
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,341
Click

76
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:37,341
boom

77
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,353
click

78
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,371
clang.

79
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,373
Unh!

80
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,388
Thwack

81
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,401
thud.

82
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:39,412
New-and-improved Batman beats original recipe.

83
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,391
But that doesn't mean our rivalry has to end.

84
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:45,428
You see, The Batman needs a Joker.

85
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,387
Someone who gives him purpose.

86
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,573
Which means if I'm going to make it as The Dark Knight.

87
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,393
I'm going to need a Joker of my own.

88
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,424
'And who better a foil than you, old friend?'

89
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,440
Ugh!

90
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,417
Joker venom.

91
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:10,449
'Just the thing to inject a bit of humor into you.'

92
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:17,415
hiss Don't fret, Batman.

93
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,424
You'll soon make a great Joker.

94
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:22,444
Just don't forget to smile.

95
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:39,440
That is quite a nasty bite, sir.

96
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:42,440
- Really, Alfred, it's nothing. - Nothing?

97
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:43,454
Who knows what chemical concoction

98
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:45,448
that madman cooked up for you.

99
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,464
Look, if the snake's venom was harmful

100
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,460
I'm sure I'd know it by now.

101
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:53,452
But to tell the truth, Alfred, I feel great.

102
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:54,488
Even a bit chipper.

103
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,461
Even so, we should let your lab results

104
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,459
'inform us whether anything dangerous'

105
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,476
'is currently coursing through your veins.'

106
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,469
I think the only dangerous thing you're gonna find

107
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,466
are my cholesterol levels.

108
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,477
- Heh heh heh. - Sir?

109
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,487
Uh, nothing, Alfred. Just a bad joke.

110
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,479
Well, I'd better get to the hospital

111
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:18,477
and see about sneaking a blood sample from Mayor Grange's wife.

112
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,481
Uh, sir, all things considered, until we know your results

113
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,497
I must <i>insist you remain</i> in the Batcave.

114
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:25,501
Sorry, Alfred, right now I'm the only hope

115
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,499
of Joker's victims getting an antidote.

116
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,507
'And, besides, Mayor Grange could probably'

117
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,497
'use some support.'

118
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:34,520
Seeing an old friend might bring a smile to his face.

119
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:43,514
I can't begin to imagine what you're going through, mayor.

120
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:47,509
It's been a real tough stretch, Bruce.

121
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,551
Your arm? You hurt yourself?

122
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,552
Cut myself shaving.

123
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,553
I'm kidding. Heh heh heh.

124
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,534
Uh, yes, well..

125
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,518
I am glad you came, Bruce.

126
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,523
I was hoping I could get your advice.

127
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,534
Joker's demanding a large ransom and the city

128
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:08,571
well, just doesn't have that kind of money available.

129
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,548
If it means helping Gotham and easing your burden

130
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:14,536
I can write you a check right now.

131
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,550
You, you'd do that?

132
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:18,551
No.

133
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,572
Yes.

134
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,555
I'm not sure that's funny, Bruce.

135
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,575
No, uh, I-I'm being very serious, sir.

136
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:31,574
Are you sure everything's alright?

137
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:37,580
Uh, maybe I am a little bit out of sorts.

138
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,580
Why don't we see how Sheila's doing?

139
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,604
I wanna warn you, it's pretty shocking.

140
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,581
Oh, that's terri..

141
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,601
Umh..

142
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,606
Bruce, please.

143
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:01,584
Sorry. Oh!

144
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,889
I don't know what's come over me.

145
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,618
Excuse me. Ha ha ha! Sorry.

146
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,635
Hey!

147
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,608
Uh.

148
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:17,637
The Joker venom.

149
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,609
'The results of the lab analysis are grim, Alfred.'

150
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:27,620
Very grim.

151
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:30,620
It seems Joker's new venom attacks the nervous system

152
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,627
and forces the body into gradually increasing

153
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:35,614
'fits of laughter until finally... '

154
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,616
Joker said he wanted an archenemy

155
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,621
but he didn't say a pulse was required.

156
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,637
That's rich!

157
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:44,643
You crack me up, Al.

158
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,650
Ah heh..

159
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,649
So, I devised this antidote.

160
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:53,636
'All I need is a sample of Joker's original venom'

161
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,643
'in order to complete it.'

162
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,645
Which would require finding Joker.

163
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:00,652
And soon, at the poison's current rate of progress.

164
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:03,667
'I have an hour left to live.'

165
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:07,680
And now only 59 minutes, 39 seconds.

166
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,677
Fifty, fifty-nine minutes, 27 seconds.

167
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:16,680
Things can't get any worse now, can they?

168
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Beep beep beep

169
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,695
kaboom.

170
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,697
Tweet, tweet!

171
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:48,696
Pull yourself together, sir.

172
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,692
I'm sorry, Alfred.

173
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,724
This venom is driving me batty. Batty!

174
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:58,738
The Batwave.

175
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,720
Break-in at, at the Gotham museum of art.

176
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:03,746
Joker?

177
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,707
The crime clown has a different.

178
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:06,719
MO these days.

179
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,715
Isn't the museum hosting a collection of priceless.

180
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:10,719
Faberge eggs this week?

181
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,713
You don't think..

182
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,718
Mm-hmm. Penguin.

183
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,719
As much as I hate to suggest it.

184
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:19,726
Oswald Cobblepot will have to get a free pass tonight

185
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,738
as your focus must be on finding Joker.

186
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,733
If Joker's playing Batman

187
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:25,732
he'll be there to take down Penguin.

188
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,740
I can hit two birds with one stone.

189
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,760
Get it? Birds!

190
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,757
Good one, sir.

191
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,740
'Break-in at the Gotham museum of art?'

192
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:40,753
This looks like a job for..

193
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,762
The Batman.

194
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:52,795
Vroom vroom vroom.

195
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:05,778
Uh, these precious eggs are gonna hatch me a fortune.

196
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,776
The perfect crime.

197
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,814
No fuss, no muss, and no... 'Penguin!'

198
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:15,811
Batman.

199
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:22,821
Swish swish swish.

200
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:26,817
Ugh!

201
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,824
Quack! Huh?

202
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,841
- 'Joker?' - I'm The Batman.

203
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,804
You see, the thing is..

204
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:45,818
You're not!

205
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,819
The eggs, Penguin, or I scramble you.

206
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:50,811
Are you out of your gourd?

207
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:51,830
I'm in the middle of a heist!

208
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,823
You don't see me barging in

209
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:56,825
on your "gas all of Gotham" schemes, do you?

210
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,817
It is called professional courtesy.

211
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,834
Sorry, Pengie, but bringing down Gotham's second-biggest criminal

212
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:05,840
means my biggest bounty yet.

213
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:07,839
Second-biggest?

214
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:08,844
Says who?

215
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:14,872
Whoosh screech Hyah!

216
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:26,888
Arr-rrgh!

217
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,900
- Joker! - Batman?

218
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:45,905
If it isn't dumb and dumber.

219
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:52,888
Okay, now you two are startin' to creep me out.

220
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:55,880
This is no longer funny, Joker.

221
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,921
Hand over the venom.

222
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:04,903
But you're so close to completing your evolution.

223
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:07,900
Ah, well, it seems you two have something to settle.

224
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,932
- So, I'll just... - Not so fast, Penguin.

225
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,929
The eggs!

226
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:29,932
Ugh, ugh, uh!

227
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:37,947
Yes!

228
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,962
That is one expensive omelet.

229
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:49,970
Since I can't leave here empty-handed..

230
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:56,936
You do not want that, Penguin.

231
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,965
If you want it, Batman, I want it.

232
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,953
Aah!

233
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:12,979
Quack!

234
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,978
Huh?

235
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:24,005
Whirr whirr Wait!

236
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:26,998
Ah!

237
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:29,988
Uh-uh-uh.

238
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:33,011
Comedy <i>is timing, you know?</i>

239
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,012
Hyah! Ooh!

240
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,024
Ha!

241
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:57,001
Well, now, what could it be that you want so badly?

242
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:00,004
Ooh, no. That is not a good idea.

243
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,036
Says you!

244
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:05,016
Ow!

245
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,048
Priceless.

246
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,036
Ow! Unh!

247
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:12,049
Aah!

248
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,033
Aa-aa-aah!

249
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,035
Unh! Mmm!

250
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,034
Well, guess I'll just hang out here.

251
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:27,061
Well, that's a good one, Pengie.

252
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:39,071
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

253
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,044
You know, what's funny.

254
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:44,079
This situation reminds me of a joke!

255
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,063
A doctor told his patient

256
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:50,048
"I have bad news and worse news."

257
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,054
Ugh!

258
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:53,057
"Oh, dear! What's the bad news?"

259
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,084
Asked the patient.

260
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,071
The doctor replied

261
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:59,060
"you only have 24 hours to live!"

262
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,070
Aah!

263
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:02,062
"That's terrible," said the patient.

264
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:04,105
"But how can the other news possibly be worse?"

265
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:15,076
The doctor replied, "Well, I've been trying to contact you

266
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,117
since yesterday!"

267
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,132
That joke always slays 'em.

268
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:53,147
You really know how to squelch a laugh.

269
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,154
Stop me if you've heard this one before, Joker.

270
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:05,161
A man walked into a bar.

271
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,137
Ow!

272
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,168
And said.

273
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,159
"Ow!"

274
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,144
Good one, Batman.

275
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:24,170
"Said, ow."

276
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,168
Who knew you had it in you?

277
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:33,195
That's the Joker I know.

278
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,176
Hey, what's so funny?

279
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,190
Ehhh..

280
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,228
