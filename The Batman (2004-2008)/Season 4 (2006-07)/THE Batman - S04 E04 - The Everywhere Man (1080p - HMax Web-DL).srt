1
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:20,014
Of course, it's taken me years to put together this collection.

2
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:22,003
And just as long to convince you

3
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,006
to give us all a peek, Marlowe.

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,021
Well, you know what they say.

5
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,046
If you've got it, flaunt it.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,014
I wonder what's gotten into John.

7
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:36,016
He finally steps out of the lab and away from his experiments

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,030
and suddenly it's, "Hi. John Marlowe, alpha male."

9
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:43,021
I, for one, think he's much more adorable as the shy geek.

10
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,041
How is it the most attractive ladies

11
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,040
always seem to gravitate to you, Bruce?

12
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:50,034
Oh, no. We were just talking about these little hot dogs.

13
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:52,042
Now, Clea, I would think the curator

14
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,050
of the Gotham Museum Of Art

15
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:56,042
would be much more interested in this.

16
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:59,053
Ah, yes. Emmerich's "Exponential Angst."

17
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:01,059
You outbid the museum for this.

18
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:05,057
It cost a fortune, but it was worth every penny.

19
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,083
And just how many pennies are we talking about?

20
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:17,072
'Who's that? What's he doing here?'

21
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:19,059
Now step aside, Marlowe

22
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,071
or I make your face resemble that painting.

23
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:24,104
John, please don't be foolish.

24
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,084
Ahh! Unh!

25
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:31,069
Should've listened to the lady, Johnny.

26
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:32,097
Thump.

27
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,120
We've got him, Batman.

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,088
'That's a broom closet.'

29
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,090
There's no way..

30
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,115
Out?

31
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,145
Beep

32
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:25,147
vroom

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,172
clang.

34
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,172
You checked the walls, floor, ceiling?

35
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:09,182
And the blueprints.

36
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,189
There was no way out of that closet, Robin.

37
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:14,208
Maybe he was posing as one of the brooms.

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,197
Silent alarm at the Gotham Museum Of Art.

39
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:25,225
A second art thief, or a second chance?

40
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,220
Vroom.

41
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:44,206
The Batman. Here for another glimpse at my disappearing act?

42
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,213
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

43
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:47,226
And then we wanna see you saw a lady in half.

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,219
There won't be any encore performances tonight.

45
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:52,229
And what makes you so sure?

46
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,213
Because this time, it's two against one.

47
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,221
Piece of cake.

48
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,241
Numbers can be deceiving.

49
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:00,263
And so can I.

50
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,222
Two of 'em?

51
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,252
So it would seem. Split up.

52
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:16,265
Thwack.

53
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:29,261
Huh! Unh!

54
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,271
'Oh, Batman.'

55
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,304
beep

56
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:49,294
whoosh.

57
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:57,301
My broom theory's sounding better all the time.

58
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:02,289
I know he took the paintings off the wall

59
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,285
but believe me, commissioner, I've triple-checked.

60
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:08,313
Nothing was stolen. Nothing's even out of place.

61
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,341
Master Bruce, have you been at this all night?

62
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,299
So, any luck?

63
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:23,320
I recovered a hair sample from the museum security station

64
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:26,310
where our intruder disabled the cameras.

65
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,330
There was a match.

66
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:31,313
'John Marlowe.'

67
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,323
So you're saying..

68
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,333
No. I've known John for years.

69
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:35,358
He's a good man.

70
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,378
And has the perfect alibi.

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,329
He was saved from the villain by the Batman himself.

72
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:43,330
Unless he staged that with someone else

73
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:44,343
to give him the alibi.

74
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,340
You gotta admit that two men would explain

75
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,345
all that strangeness at the museum.

76
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,345
Well, some of it, anyway.

77
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,338
But if you don't think he's our guy...

78
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:56,338
No. I can't rule him out just because we're friends.

79
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,353
I have to hope that any further evidence we uncover

80
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,350
will only prove his innocence.

81
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,348
Let's revisit the crime scenes.

82
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:05,371
There has to be something we've missed.

83
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:15,358
Ding Bruce, what brings you by?

84
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:16,372
In all the excitement the other night

85
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:19,378
I never did get a chance to admire your collection.

86
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:23,379
Come on. We both know that's not why you're here.

87
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,374
Who can resist a mystery?

88
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,379
You wanna see the closet for yourself.

89
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,392
Guilty as charged.

90
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,412
Be my guest.

91
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,394
'Readings are coming in, Master Bruce.'

92
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:43,425
Interesting, we're picking up traces

93
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,429
of low-spectrum radioactivity in that closet.

94
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,392
Beep And Master Dick seems to be finding

95
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,407
the same radioactivity at the museum

96
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:56,431
'on the mysteriously reappeared stolen paintings.'

97
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,411
Thanks for indulging me, John.

98
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,402
Not a problem.

99
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:05,424
Closet aside, I do have an ulterior motive

100
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,414
for coming here today.

101
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:09,407
I'm worried about you.

102
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,417
Really?

103
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,429
Something's different, John.

104
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:15,417
The party, the way you tried to take on that masked thief

105
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,431
even the way you talk.. It isn't you.

106
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,417
What's the matter, Brucie?

107
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,422
Scared of a little social competition?

108
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,434
People change, I apologize if I no longer fit

109
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,442
into some comfortable role you've once defined for me.

110
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,429
I didn't mean to upset you.

111
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:30,461
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:33,443
It's fine.

113
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,479
Truth is, I have been a little all over the place lately.

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,470
Oh, my.

115
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,458
Okay, still confused.

116
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,458
Marlowe's company's been conducting experiments

117
00:07:58,482 --> 00:07:59,923
in quantum theory for the government.

118
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,461
Which explains why he's radioactive

119
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,478
but what's the deal with him not stealing stuff?

120
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:06,503
There's always an explanation.

121
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,472
'The readings point to two radiation hot-spots'

122
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:11,479
in the building.

123
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:13,478
I'll take this one. You track the other.

124
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:15,494
- And be care... - Please don't say it.

125
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,493
Fine. Go.

126
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,501
Swish swish

127
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,524
beep beep.

128
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:54,548
The sign said "Authorized personnel only," Batman.

129
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,525
So what happens now, Marlowe?

130
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,525
You teleport away again?

131
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,530
Is that what I've been doing?

132
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:12,530
No, there's a much simpler explanation

133
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,557
and it's right behind you.

134
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,547
Then your quantum technology isn't behind this.

135
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,551
That means all you had

136
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,586
was an accomplice in the same costume.

137
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,574
Getting warmer.

138
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:35,593
Beep whoosh

139
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:48,609
ding.

140
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:52,606
Going up?

141
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:56,617
Huh.

142
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,621
Enjoying the ride?

143
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:11,631
Beats the company.

144
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:21,604
Ding 'Penthouse level.'

145
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:23,621
Nefarious plots, brilliant schemes

146
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,639
doomed heroes.

147
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:30,648
Have a nice evening.

148
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,615
You've been expected.

149
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,621
Welcome, Batman. We've been waiting for you.

150
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,631
Allow me to introduce myself.

151
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:43,659
I am the Everywhere Man.

152
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:49,640
'Batman's in custody'

153
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,644
'but his partner may already be in the building.'

154
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,642
- What's our priority? - Securing the prisoner.

155
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,653
We might need more men.

156
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,637
Then we'll make more.

157
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,672
Beep.

158
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:04,687
Okay, so my broom theory was way off.

159
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,670
Time to bust out Batman.

160
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:12,660
It was the quantum-field research, of course.

161
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,661
It lead to the creation of the Quantex.

162
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:18,679
With it, I can charge my body's quantum particles..

163
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,665
And replicate another me.

164
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,671
My energy duplicates can split at will

165
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:27,708
but with the Quantex, I can also recall them at will..

166
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:31,685
Even from a distance.

167
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,716
Which is how you escaped from the broom closet.

168
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,719
Sleight of hand, I know, yet effective.

169
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,713
Still, that's only the tip of the Quantex iceberg.

170
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:42,713
Beep.

171
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,685
Please, sit down.

172
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,699
I'll stand.

173
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:51,702
Your device made quantum copies of the art at the museum.

174
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:55,695
Leaving me free to steal the originals for my collection.

175
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,722
You mean for John Marlowe's collection.

176
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:18,716
- The prisoner? - Secure inside.

177
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,732
'They must have Batman in there.'

178
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:21,760
'Uh-oh.'

179
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,767
clang

180
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:32,757
thwack

181
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:37,764
beep

182
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:39,768
whack.

183
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:42,746
Unh..

184
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,785
Hold on, Batman. Almost there.

185
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,796
Hmm?

186
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,788
You're not Batman.

187
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,780
'You're not John Marlowe.'

188
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,777
You're just another counterfeit.

189
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,784
You're hot with the same quantum radiation signature

190
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,772
we found on the copies at the museum.

191
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,518
And there was nothing in his past to suggest

192
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,795
the real John Marlowe would commit these crimes.

193
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,788
Very good, Batman.

194
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,779
I was copy number one.

195
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:23,788
Sometimes it takes an upgrade to get things right.

196
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,793
Johnny may be a brilliant scientist

197
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:26,828
but he's also a fool.

198
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,329
He kept me around to be his lab partner

199
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,805
but keep a duplicate around long enough

200
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,825
and you know what you get?

201
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,798
Free will.

202
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:37,808
Johnny and I both loved our art collection

203
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:38,993
'but he wasn't willing to do'

204
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,799
what was necessary to add to it.

205
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:42,805
I was.

206
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:43,815
Enough with the art collection.

207
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,848
All this power, and we're only stealing paintings.

208
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,813
Excuse me?

209
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:48,820
Who cares about art?

210
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,825
We could use the Quantex to conquer the world.

211
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,831
Like a bad photocopy

212
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:55,832
each duplicate is just a little darker than the last.

213
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:56,835
Shut up!

214
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,831
Don't tell him to shut up. Shut him up.

215
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:02,829
Look, if you can't handle things, I will.

216
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:06,827
Whoosh See? Free will.

217
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,828
But I know how to deal with it.

218
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:09,846
And Johnny didn't.

219
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,845
No, he didn't.

220
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,852
So you got rid of him.

221
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:15,877
I never get rid of anything.

222
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,842
I'm a collector, Batman.

223
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:21,884
And you keep your collection close at hand.

224
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,882
John Marlowe's in this building, which is all I wanted to know.

225
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:27,887
Boom.

226
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,868
Attention, Everywhere Man

227
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,875
'the Batman is loose in our building.'

228
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,888
'You know the drill. Divide and conquer.'

229
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,886
whoosh whoosh whoosh 'Fill the corridors.'

230
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,897
'Find the bat. Exterminate it.'

231
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,902
whoosh whoosh whoosh.

232
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:57,920
When all is said and done

233
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,897
he is but one man, but we..

234
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,912
We are an army.

235
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,896
'Batman's been spotted by the atrium.'

236
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,931
'All Everywhere Men to the atrium.'

237
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:16,926
slam

238
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:23,944
clang

239
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:43,946
thump thump thump.

240
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:50,934
Oh, come now, Batman.

241
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,941
How long do you really think you can last?

242
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,945
'It hardly matters how many of me you break.'

243
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:56,979
'I'll just make more.'

244
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,965
boom boom boom.

245
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,951
And will they all smell as bad as you?

246
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:09,986
Smack.

247
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:19,987
One more enemy will hardly make a difference against my army.

248
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:27,009
Yeah, but if I'm not just one more?

249
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,983
'What are you doing with my prototype?'

250
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,012
beep.

251
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:37,018
Check out <i>my army.</i>

252
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,014
Boom boom boom.

253
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,002
How's it going, Batman?

254
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:01,024
Better, now that you're here, partners.

255
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,049
Well, if it isn't old Johnny boy.

256
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,019
I knew I should have eliminated you.

257
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:13,024
'I always was too sentimental.'

258
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,015
True.

259
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,020
You even saved the Quantex prototype.

260
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,017
That's going to be your downfall.

261
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,037
There's a reason a prototype's only a prototype.

262
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:24,058
'Sometimes it takes an upgrade to get things right.'

263
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:28,028
Whoa. That's not right.

264
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,046
The unit's overloaded.

265
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,040
Oh, it's worse than that, Johnny.

266
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:34,060
Your duplicates are unstable.

267
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,073
One solid punch, and poof.

268
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:42,050
That's it. It's dead.

269
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,059
- We're on our own. - Suits me.

270
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,066
Never was much good at long division.

271
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,058
Cool. You take the high road..

272
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,077
And you take the low road.

273
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:13,101
We've just run out of reinforcements.

274
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:18,075
Let go of me.

275
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,091
Quiet, Johnny boy.

276
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:23,087
Batman may not know it, but the battle's over.

277
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,115
'It's only a matter of time.'

278
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:30,093
Did you hear that? It's only a matter of time.

279
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,090
Before you're toast.

280
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:34,102
And before you've outlived your usefulness.

281
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:36,112
What's copy number one gonna do with so many of you?

282
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,139
'Where could he hide a few hundred Marlowes?'

283
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,117
'And how could he stand the competition?'

284
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:42,104
'When the fighting's done'

285
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:45,108
'he'll recall each and every one of you.'

286
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:48,108
You'll all cease to exist.

287
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,126
What if the Batman's right?

288
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,124
Don't listen to him. Keep fighting.

289
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:56,121
Hey, think about it. If we win this, we're toast.

290
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:59,118
Shut up, you traitor!

291
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,124
If one of us survives, we all do.

292
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:04,130
Then you won't mind if I'm the one surviving.

293
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:07,132
The Quantex.. As long as he has it, none of us are safe.

294
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:09,136
You're playing right into his hand.

295
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,134
Don't worry. We'll protect you.

296
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,174
But they all look alike.

297
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,176
How will you know who's with you and who's against you?

298
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,151
Quiet. You want him to recall all of us?

299
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,146
Now that's a plan.

300
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,155
I'll get it. Get the Quantex!

301
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,165
We can't let him use it.

302
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:29,184
No. Stop.

303
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,172
Don't make me do it.

304
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:39,185
Beep poof poof poof.

305
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:42,183
Huh?

306
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,167
You haven't won yet, Batman.

307
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:48,182
Two against one. Piece of cake.

308
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,211
I'll create another army of Everywhere Men.

309
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,180
With the same result.

310
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,188
Then I'll recall it and start over

311
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,186
as many times as I have to.

312
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,213
Eventually you'll fall.

313
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,221
Will you please shut up?

314
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,202
'I thought I could help people everywhere'

315
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:14,222
but all I am is... Nowhere Man.

316
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:17,203
'John, it's great of you'

317
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:19,216
'to donate your entire collection to the museum.'

318
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,206
'It seemed like the right thing to do'

319
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,391
'after everything I've done.'

320
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,217
But, John, you didn't do anything.

321
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:29,214
Perhaps, but part of me always wanted to be

322
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:33,215
more like that other Marlowe.. Confident, cool..

323
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,230
Maybe it's a good thing that the only place

324
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:37,217
I've ever been comfortable is inside my shell.

325
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:40,241
Any room in that shell for one more?

326
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,239
Johnny, you've spent too much time locked away

327
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:51,244
with your art collection and science projects.

328
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:53,242
Stay out here with..

329
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,254
With you?

330
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:16,295
Screech vroom

331
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:23,304
whoosh
