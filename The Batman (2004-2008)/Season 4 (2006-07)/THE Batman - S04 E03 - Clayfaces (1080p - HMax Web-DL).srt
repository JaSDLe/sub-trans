1
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,005
Ha ha ha ha!

2
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,000
'A drop or two of Joker serum'

3
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,006
into each can of dog food

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,011
'and every Rex, Rover, and Fido in Gotham'

5
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:25,005
'will laugh like a hyena!'

6
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,008
Ah-ha ha ha!

7
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,012
The kids'll love it.

8
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,019
Pardon me, sir.

9
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:33,028
Your plan, how does one put it?

10
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:35,024
Stinks on ice.

11
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:38,017
I must concur, Jude.

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,037
Okay, one..

13
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,039
You never ever talk to me like that.

14
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,028
And two..

15
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:47,050
When did you two ever talk at all?

16
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,041
Oh, no!

17
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,075
Oh, yes.

18
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,066
Clayface!

19
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,115
It's time you finally paid

20
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,129
for making me into this monster, Joker.

21
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:14,116
Pay? You should thank me.

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,119
Detective Bennett was so blah.

23
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,125
Huh, this is an improvement!

24
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:20,125
This is a curse!

25
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:21,131
Rrahh!

26
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,155
Huh?

27
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:30,163
Ha ha ha!

28
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:39,165
This time, Joker, there's no escape.

29
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:42,146
How about we put me down

30
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,150
and settle this like gentlem...

31
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:48,175
Oh, we'll settle it, alright.

32
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:53,161
Don't do it, Clayface.

33
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:55,167
Hey, Bats. Been expecting you.

34
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:58,162
- Who's the kid? - The name's Robin.

35
00:02:58,186 --> 00:03:00,164
Allow me to introduce my foot to your...

36
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:02,204
Put him down.

37
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,209
- Unh! - He's all yours.

38
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,181
Just finishing up some old business..

39
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:12,205
Before I turn myself in as well.

40
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,185
I thought Ethan Bennett was gone for good.

41
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,223
Me, too. But a criminal isn't who I am.

42
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,185
I'm ready to pay for my crimes.

43
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:26,205
We're not gonna trust this crook.

44
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,193
Are we, Batman?

45
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,213
Who do you think tipped off the police?

46
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,231
Freeze! Gotham P.D.!

47
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,249
Two for one. Good work, Batman.

48
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,210
Thank Detective Bennett, he made the collar

49
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:50,219
'and turned himself in.'

50
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:53,247
Ex-detective. Take 'em away.

51
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,262
Well, that was easy. Why don't we knock off early?

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,263
'Catch a movie?'

53
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,268
Next, please.

54
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:11,256
Basil Karlo.

55
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,252
You can stop the auditions because you are looking

56
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:17,248
at the new face of Waggy-time dog food.

57
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:20,243
Yeah, we'll need to read you anyway.

58
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,268
Just a formality.

59
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,249
It's magic time.

60
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:30,248
Waggy-time is the only premium dog food

61
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,264
that's good enough for my best friend.

62
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:36,266
It has the rich, meaty taste that dogs crave.

63
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,297
Waggy-time. It's wag-a-riffic!

64
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,276
Okay, we've seen enough.

65
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,303
I'm afraid you just don't have the right look.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,273
What is it now?

67
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:53,276
My nose?

68
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,293
Last time my ears were too big.

69
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:56,279
Before that, I was too short!

70
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:58,293
What do I gotta do to get a stinkin' part?

71
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:02,283
Maybe you should think about acting classes.

72
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,284
Acting classes? Ha!

73
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:05,294
You wouldn't know a good actor

74
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,286
if you tripped over one.

75
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,326
One day, everyone in Gotham will know this face.

76
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,317
'I met Ethan when I was a little younger than you.'

77
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,305
'We got left behind at the natural history museum'

78
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,318
on a school field trip.

79
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:23,321
And spent the rest of the day

80
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,321
exploring Gotham on our own.

81
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:27,324
We've been best friends ever since.

82
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,312
Until Joker turned his mind into mud.

83
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,317
You said he tried to go straight once before.

84
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,317
Think you can trust him this time?

85
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,327
I once trusted Ethan enough

86
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,324
to nearly reveal my secret to him.

87
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,351
I'm not so sure anymore.

88
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:54,350
Bruce! Nice to see a friendly face around here.

89
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:56,340
I have good news.

90
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:59,337
Wayne Industries is this close to a cure.

91
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,359
Soon, Clayface will be just a bad memory.

92
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:04,344
That's great, Bruce, but..

93
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:06,380
I'm not so sure I wanna be cured.

94
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,367
I always thought what happened to me was a curse.

95
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:13,366
But taking down Joker made me think.

96
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,369
What if I serve my time and come back on the force

97
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,359
as Clayface?

98
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,371
The bad guys wouldn't stand a chance.

99
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,375
We've been down that road before, Ethan.

100
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,371
Your powers lead to abuse.

101
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:27,372
The only way to bring Ethan Bennett back fully

102
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,407
is to rid you of Clayface completely.

103
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,420
Maybe I need a new headshot.

104
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,411
'Now there's a face only a mother could love.'

105
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,403
Oh! Sorry.

106
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:52,435
Just bring me the usual.

107
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,402
After capturing Joker.

108
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:57,406
Clayface turned himself in to Gotham police.

109
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,411
'Detective Ethan Bennett terrorized Gotham city'

110
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:02,415
'as Clayface, with his ability'

111
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,417
'to change his shape and mold his features.'

112
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:09,407
Man. What I'd give to be able to mold this mug.

113
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:11,426
Wayne Industries has isolated the mutagen

114
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,416
'that gave Bennett his extraordinary powers'

115
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,416
'and report they are close to developing a cure.'

116
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,435
Huh? A cure?

117
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,458
What a waste.

118
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:25,459
Wayne Industries, huh?

119
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:39,448
Okay, people, where are we? Let's go, talk to me.

120
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:43,449
Can I help you, Dr. Norv... off?

121
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:45,460
Somebody point me to the Clayface mutagen.

122
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:48,477
I need to run an electron scan, stat!

123
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,469
Can I see your clearance?

124
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:56,456
I got your clearance right here, poindexter!

125
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,493
Hey! Come back! Oh!

126
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,969
Highly unstable sample coming through!

127
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,473
I need to get to the electron chamber, stat!

128
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:08,498
Stop right there!

129
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,478
Aww, nuts!

130
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,520
Calm down, buddy. There's nowhere to go.

131
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:26,521
Too late.

132
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,521
Better call an ambulance.

133
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,497
Uhh!

134
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,514
- Whoa. - Unh!

135
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,541
Code red in sector 8!

136
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,530
Help!

137
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,524
He's crazy! He took my purse.

138
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:50,535
- He went that way. - Intruder heading north.

139
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:56,544
What a performance!

140
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,531
The suspect ingested a highly concentrated form

141
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,531
of the Clayface mutagen Ethan was exposed to.

142
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,549
I don't get it, why would anyone

143
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:14,544
willingly down a dangerous toxin?

144
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:16,553
There are a lot of troubled people out there, Dick.

145
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:20,541
Once we find our man, we'll find our answer.

146
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,556
We have a match. Basil Karlo.

147
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,544
He's an actor.

148
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,558
That is, if starring in "Revenge Of The Atomic Clone"

149
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,585
qualifies as acting.

150
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,569
Twenty years ago, I was thrown out

151
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,569
of the university for crimes against nature.

152
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,574
Why?

153
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:40,563
'Because of my work to create a race'

154
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:42,569
'of bio-genetic supermen!'

155
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,034
Can't understand why he hasn't worked

156
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,571
in over 10 years.

157
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,608
We are so watching that movie.

158
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,592
Has that rich, meaty taste that dogs crave!

159
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:00,590
Waggy-time. It's wag-a-riffic!

160
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,598
Thank you, uh, Brock.

161
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,590
I think we've seen enough.

162
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,619
So... when do we start shooting?

163
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,604
I'm sorry but you're just not right for the role.

164
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:14,608
Really, because if my look is the problem

165
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:17,619
that I can change.

166
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,636
I can even play the dog.

167
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,613
Three people were hospitalized today

168
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:34,632
following an assault by a man

169
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:38,619
with the powers of the super villain Clayface.

170
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:41,636
Oh, what have I done? My life is ruined.

171
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,622
With Ethan Bennett in custody police have turned

172
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,636
their attention to a second Clayface

173
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,642
a man identified by victims as actor Basil Karlo.

174
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,646
Great. They know it's me. Oh!

175
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,661
They know it's me.

176
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:03,647
Basil Karlo, seen here in this high school production of..

177
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:06,654
- Karlo was born in Denver.. - The actor has been in..

178
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,653
To create a race of bio-genetic supermen.

179
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,691
'Beings of unthinkable strength and power.'

180
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:21,685
Aah! It's him! Clayface!

181
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:32,692
A star is born!

182
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,698
It's magic time.

183
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:46,699
Clayface. A most pitiable freak of nature.

184
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,690
'But it was not the mutation'

185
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,697
'that turned him into a monster.'

186
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,697
Rather his fellow man

187
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:55,730
who viewed this troubled soul as a pariah.

188
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,706
And though he knew it was too late

189
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,746
he secretly hoped for a chance at redemption.

190
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,714
'Show's over, Karlo.'

191
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:15,732
It's not too late to get help.

192
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,722
It is too late for acting lessons, though.

193
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:23,744
Sorry, Batman. But this is the role I was born to play.

194
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:27,752
Heh heh heh.

195
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,758
Aah!

196
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:47,786
Hmm?

197
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,765
- Mmm! - You're not a criminal, Karlo.

198
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,769
Why use these powers to become one?

199
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:04,770
Because that's what the role is, isn't it, Batman?

200
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:07,767
And now that I'm a celebrity I'll need the cash

201
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,810
to start living like one.

202
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,782
Now answer me a question.

203
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,815
How long can your little buddy hold his breath?

204
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:18,819
Aah! No... no. Mmph!

205
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,811
'Clayface 2 continues his week-long crime spree'

206
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:37,798
'with a robbery at the Gotham jewelry exchange.'

207
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:41,801
I interviewed Karlo yesterday at an undisclosed location.

208
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,819
My mother, she walked out on us kids when I was five.

209
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,816
We had to beg on the streets.

210
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,807
My sister, little Susie, used to ask

211
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:53,820
why she had to go to bed hungry every night.

212
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:56,820
I'm sorry. Are you crying?

213
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:58,822
No. What about the Batman?

214
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,831
Hey! This isn't about Batman. It's about me!

215
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:04,822
Then you're not concerned the dark knight will stop you?

216
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:07,851
Look, lady, Gotham's got a new leading man.

217
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,834
No one's been able to stop Karlo.

218
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:11,844
Not even the Batman.

219
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,845
It'd just be a temporary re-assignment.

220
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,853
If you could just put in a good word for me.

221
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,845
Don't even ask, Ethan.

222
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:20,856
Bruce, you once said you trusted me like a brother.

223
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,850
'I need you to trust me now.'

224
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:25,860
I need a chance to prove myself

225
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:29,880
and it takes a Clayface to stop a Clayface.

226
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,884
Dinnertime, Mr. Bennett.

227
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,888
No! It's not possible.

228
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:53,888
You called it, Bruce.

229
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:55,883
Think he's going after Karlo?

230
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,903
Sometimes Ethan's his own worst enemy.

231
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,887
Wayne Industries has just finished a dose of antidote.

232
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,912
I'll go there to pick it up. You track down Bennett.

233
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:21,913
This should get me on the national news.

234
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,931
Hmm?

235
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,909
You're late.

236
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,922
Some of us don't have jet-propelled cars.

237
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,912
Gordon just got a tip about Karlo's whereabouts.

238
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:35,944
Gosh, Batman. Let's go clobber that creep.

239
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:49,953
Aahhh!

240
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:52,974
Gotcha, bat-jerk!

241
00:15:58,967 --> 00:15:59,980
Huh?

242
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,972
- Boo. - Clayface?

243
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,958
Knew you couldn't resist a chance

244
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:07,947
to take down the Batman.

245
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:08,966
How did you know it was me?

246
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,989
My grandma can do a better Robin than you.

247
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:29,984
Why are you even here?

248
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:32,986
- You're not a cop anymore. - I am a cop.

249
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,984
Always was, always will be.

250
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:39,979
And I will not rest until I bring you down.

251
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,013
Hmm. Not gonna happen.

252
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:57,008
You see? I've been practicing.

253
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:58,016
And this Clayface sequel

254
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,036
is bigger and better than the original.

255
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:26,050
You should've stayed in Arkham.

256
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:48,083
Whoa. Uh... I can explain.

257
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,090
The antidote! No!

258
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,068
Come on, take the serum!

259
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,069
Sorry, Bats. I didn't mean to.

260
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,082
I'm one of the good guys now.

261
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:09,100
The good guys don't break out of Arkham.

262
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,106
Rraahh!

263
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,094
Bats! You need me on this one.

264
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:36,121
Take the antidote and sit this one out.

265
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,125
I say we let him help.

266
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,129
Bats! Trust me!

267
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,178
That doesn't sound good.

268
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,184
Robin!

269
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,183
Over here, Bats.

270
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:51,190
I think we did it, Bats.

271
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,207
It's magic time!

272
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:10,187
Pull back. We need to regroup.

273
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,212
No! Just get the antidote ready.

274
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:46,241
Huh? What're you doing?

275
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:50,249
Get out of me!

276
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:54,250
Now, Bats. The antidote!

277
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:56,245
What?

278
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,276
- End it! - No!

279
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:25,290
Welcome back, Ethan.

280
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:32,276
The doctors say even though you shared

281
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,288
a single dose of antidote

282
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,279
your tests show a complete remission

283
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,291
of the mutated cells.

284
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:37,319
When I get out of here

285
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,290
what do you say we shoot some hoops?

286
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:41,282
Count on it.

287
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,288
I know I have a long way to go.

288
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:46,307
But I hope I can earn back your trust.

289
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:53,299
Checkmate, Clayboy.

290
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:55,293
They say you're cured.

291
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:58,332
But I think you're still a little soft in the head.

292
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,335
Ha ha ha ha!

293
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:08,328
Jerk.

294
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,350
Huh?
