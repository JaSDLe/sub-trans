1
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:22,004
- Commissioner, it's him. - Gordon.

2
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,013
'Maybe I haven't been clear, Gordon'

3
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:27,015
'so allow me to reiterate one last time.'

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,026
No payment by midnight, and I remodel Gotham City.

5
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,021
'I had hoped last night's demonstration'

6
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,039
'would show you I was serious.'

7
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,027
boom.

8
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:41,039
'But it seems you have chosen not to comply.'

9
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:46,031
'Fine! Destruction on a much grander scale now lies ahead.'

10
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:47,058
We need more time.

11
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:52,040
Time is not something you have anymore.

12
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,075
Goodnight, Gordon, and goodbye.

13
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,072
Crackle Hmm..

14
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:08,062
Aah!

15
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:09,089
Huh?

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,098
Ugh!

17
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:26,065
I'm not one of those Arkham loners you're used to, Batman.

18
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:29,069
'I have a vast organization to deal with you.'

19
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:30,096
smack smack.

20
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:34,115
Memo to Black Mask..

21
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,118
You're not the only one with an organization.

22
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,144
Ka-ching

23
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:22,160
vroom

24
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,202
ka-ching

25
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,218
vroom.

26
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:50,229
Black Mask's reign of terror is over.

27
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,216
Not with a device still out there

28
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,214
that could destroy half of Gotham.

29
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:57,220
Black Mask is the only one with the firing codes to activate it.

30
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,217
Without the firing codes, it's useless.

31
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,240
Still, I think we'll all sleep better once we find it.

32
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:05,224
Let's hope his laptop holds some answers.

33
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,235
I'll try to sweat its location out of him at my end.

34
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:10,243
And, Batman?

35
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,233
Good work.

36
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:15,236
You like our work on the others, commish?

37
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,257
Uh, yes. Every little bit helps, son.

38
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:22,263
Today's lesson, Robin, no props for bagging henchmen.

39
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,262
Since you took point on the Black Mask smackdown

40
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:37,263
how about Batgirl and I handle finding the doomsday device?

41
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,262
I've got that covered. I want you two on the police escort.

42
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,279
Escort? Does that involve helping Gordon

43
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:44,274
pin a corsage on Black Mask?

44
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:47,265
Until I find the device, it's important the police have you

45
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,276
on surveillance should Black Mask's men try something.

46
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,273
If it's so important, you can do escort

47
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:53,278
and we'll save the city.

48
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,289
Then you know how to deactivate

49
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:57,303
an electromagnetic shockwave generator?

50
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,285
Vroom How are we supposed to know anything

51
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,309
if we always get the grunt work?

52
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,306
Wonder what Batman will have us on next?

53
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,312
"I have an important mission for you two.

54
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,314
"The Batmobile must be washed.

55
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,321
Two coats of wax this time."

56
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,303
"And don't forget to hang

57
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,324
"one of those tree-shaped air fresheners.

58
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:29,343
The fate of Gotham depends on it."

59
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,340
East side is all clear.

60
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:44,348
West side is clear and very, very, very bored.

61
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,357
'Mmm!'

62
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,345
Suggest a 2102, procurement of snacks from police lobby.

63
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,369
'Roger that.'

64
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,350
Weird, sir. We can't ID him.

65
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:01,349
No fingerprints, no distinguishing marks

66
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:04,354
and we, um, can't get the mask off.

67
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:08,387
Yeah, but we have him, and that's what counts.

68
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:28,391
The shockwave generator is not here anymore, Batman.

69
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,407
But we are.

70
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:57,432
Hah!

71
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:19,453
Oh.

72
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,444
Hello, Batman.

73
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:37,439
I'm Number One, Black Mask's second in command.

74
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,480
Excellent detective work

75
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,458
but we are aware of your abilities.

76
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,484
As soon as the laptop was compromised

77
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,459
we relocated the device.

78
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,458
That just means a little more work for me

79
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:50,452
and a lot more pain for you.

80
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,463
You can amuse Black Mask with your threats.

81
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,481
He'll be here soon to deal with you personally.

82
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:04,490
Chomp chomp Eaten by a crow.

83
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,483
I think he fell on a spoon.

84
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:09,487
Nah. I bet he's not even missing an eye.

85
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,512
He just thinks eye patches are cool.

86
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,517
Backup has arrived, which means we can punch out.

87
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,795
If you don't tell us the location

88
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,483
of the shockwave generator

89
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,495
it's gonna be 30 to 40 years

90
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,486
'before you walk out of this building.'

91
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,506
But, Gordon, I plan to walk out of this building

92
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,492
in 30 to 40 seconds.

93
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:33,837
And how exactly are you going to..

94
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:01,559
Fizz.

95
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:26,578
Excuse me, commissioner, I have a city to destroy.

96
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,564
We wait for the gas to clear, then go get him?

97
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:39,586
No need. Black Mask will walk out all by himself.

98
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,587
Not that I'm impressed or anything

99
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:52,582
but how'd you know where to find the vent controls?

100
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:55,618
Commish's daughter. I practically grew up here.

101
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,608
So, think this has something to do with Black Mask?

102
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:08,587
Magic pool ball says..

103
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,597
"It is certain."

104
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:12,594
We can make this hard or easy

105
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,622
but I am walkin' out that door.

106
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,634
Hard!

107
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,623
Aah! Uh!

108
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:33,645
- Aah! - Ha ha!

109
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,648
Aah!

110
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,653
Ohh!

111
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,670
Something is wrong.

112
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,662
Too bad your plan didn't count on us.

113
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:11,674
Or the army of cops that just arrived.

114
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,686
Screech.

115
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:19,689
Huh?

116
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,704
Looks like more grunt work.

117
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:44,726
Thoughts?

118
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,702
What would Batman do?

119
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,731
'He'd use his superior crime fighting skills'

120
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,710
to deduce two against a whole bunch equals, uh-oh!

121
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:57,696
Wait. This building has emergency security gates.

122
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,718
They're meant to keep the bad guys in during a jailbreak

123
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,715
but I bet they'd keep the bad guys out too.

124
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:03,718
What are we waiting for?

125
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,743
The gates are downstairs.

126
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:20,729
'Okay, let's get ready.'

127
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,722
You hold them off. I'll find the gate switch.

128
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,764
Hey, what part of that plan is fair?

129
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,738
Huh!

130
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,767
Oh!

131
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,769
Where is it?

132
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:48,784
Beep beep beep.

133
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,760
Okay, not it.

134
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,788
Less deejaying and more gate closing!

135
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,782
Aha!

136
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,788
Robin!

137
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:16,796
- Aah! - Ohh!

138
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,809
Boom boom

139
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,823
swoosh

140
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:24,820
Robin! No!

141
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:30,830
Miss me?

142
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:34,805
Batgirl and Robin are causing delays.

143
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,807
Children. I was beginning to think we had a real problem.

144
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,815
Still, we should have been out of here by now.

145
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,836
Find a way in and find it fast.

146
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:51,837
He'll be fine. They all will, but it's going to be a long nap.

147
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,821
Well, I'd be snoozing too

148
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:56,827
if you didn't save me with my own re-breather.

149
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,846
Rookie mistake. I made my share.

150
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:06,837
I'll check for all possible entry points. You call Batman.

151
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,832
Don't waste your time.

152
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:12,836
By now, my men have ensured the Batman can't help anyone..

153
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,864
Anymore.

154
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,850
No answer. You think...

155
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,862
No. Batman's finding the shockwave generator

156
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,860
and we're keeping happy face away from it until he does.

157
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:29,860
The Batman was the only roadblock to my freedom.

158
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:33,878
- Yeah? What are we then? - Speed bumps.

159
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,866
Ask Joker and Penguin if we're just speed bumps.

160
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,865
Take credit for Batman's work

161
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,875
but that doesn't change the fact that without him

162
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,905
all you two are are scared, little children.

163
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:51,892
So, Robin, what do you think? The unibrow and bad perm?

164
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,884
Hmm... I'll go with delicate cheekbones

165
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:57,109
and a 13-year-old's moustache.

166
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,885
What are you talking about?

167
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:01,881
Robin, how about an all-precinct distress call

168
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:02,901
to even things up?

169
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:05,908
Click Or not.

170
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,911
They found a way in.

171
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,908
These guys are good.

172
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,930
Swish

173
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:21,932
swish swish.

174
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:28,950
Ooh!

175
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:34,953
Swish swish swish They just keep coming.

176
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:41,955
Not if we can plug the hole. Keep 'em busy.

177
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,968
Hey! Who made me the keep-'em-busy guy?

178
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:51,945
Aah!

179
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,954
Hah!

180
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,979
Rizz

181
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,971
zap zap zap.

182
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,972
Ohh!

183
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,978
Snap

184
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:16,993
swoosh.

185
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:19,961
- Aah! - Aah!

186
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,001
Crash.

187
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,989
Phew!

188
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:30,984
We still own this place.

189
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:34,995
Thud But how much longer?

190
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:48,988
We're almost through, Number One.

191
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,020
Almost isn't fast enough for Black Mask.

192
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,036
Thud.

193
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,037
A barricade? Are we making our last stand?

194
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,189
I don't know what else to do.

195
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,047
Batman would.

196
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,042
Screech

197
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,044
crash.

198
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,043
When my men arrive, I'm considering

199
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,037
having them peel you like a grape.

200
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,034
Says the man locked in a cage.

201
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:36,053
You still don't get it, do you?

202
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:39,055
This time Batman doesn't save the day..

203
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,067
Or you.

204
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:55,082
Tried to pick his nose and missed. Huh? Huh?

205
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:01,083
Do you ever get... scared?

206
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,076
What? You're scared?

207
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,066
A, no, and B, let's not redirect the question.

208
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,086
Do I get scared?

209
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,093
Yeah, sometimes, I guess.

210
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,116
Showtime.

211
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,101
Something keep you?

212
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,104
The device is ready, sir.

213
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,104
<i>All you need to do is enter the firing code</i>

214
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:44,126
<i>and half of Gotham will be destroyed.</i>

215
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:59,122
Bet you wish you had this right now, huh?

216
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,162
Utility belt, charge to stun.

217
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:06,126
Who's he talkin' to?

218
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,151
Activate.

219
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,176
Rizz clang.

220
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:25,147
Our chance to step up as crime fighters, and we choke.

221
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,187
What would Batman say if he saw us like this?

222
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:32,171
The word stop whining come to mind.

223
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:35,193
These boots aren't just made for walking.

224
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,183
Now, wanna save the city?

225
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:45,172
No sign of them, but their ride's still here.

226
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:46,597
Then they must have another way out.

227
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,200
Rooftop!

228
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,178
You will be able to enter the firing code

229
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:58,182
on a computer waiting in the copter.

230
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,194
Very good, Number One.

231
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:02,210
You're to be congratulated for getting me out.

232
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,211
And fired for letting children slow you down.

233
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,233
You, you're my new Number One.

234
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,221
Finish them.

235
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:35,231
Hah!

236
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,237
Almost missed my flight.

237
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,249
Ahh!

238
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,266
Unh!

239
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,262
Aah!

240
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:08,255
Let's see if this robin can fly.

241
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,286
Unh!

242
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,271
Huh!

243
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:15,278
Aah! Whoa!

244
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:24,306
Swoosh

245
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,292
clank.

246
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:29,282
'Enter code.'

247
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:31,311
'Firing sequence activated.'

248
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,313
Huh?

249
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:40,278
You're going back to Gotham PD.

250
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:43,289
Highly doubtful, since there won't be a Gotham PD

251
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:44,322
to go back to.

252
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,322
- Dad! - We're too late!

253
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,332
Huh?

254
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:20,359
Rizz rizz.

255
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,330
Batman. Figures.

256
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:28,338
No wonder you always take point.

257
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:29,367
You're good.

258
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,352
And you guys are pretty good at grunt work.

259
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:38,341
Now who wants to wash the Batmobile?

260
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:39,375
Huh?
