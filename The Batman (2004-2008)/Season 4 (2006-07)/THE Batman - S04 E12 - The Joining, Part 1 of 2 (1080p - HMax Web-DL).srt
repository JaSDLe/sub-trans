1
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:14,034
Clang clang clang whirr.

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey, Chris, you get a haircut?

3
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,011
Yeah, I figured it's the only thing

4
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:21,000
he'll see from up there.

5
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:24,028
'Oh, yeah. The big boss is visiting today.'

6
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:29,012
You have a great view from your office, Mr. Fox.

7
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:31,023
Call me Lucius. And I agree.

8
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:33,032
I never get tired of watching the process.

9
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,031
Everyone working together like that

10
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:38,031
all those people. It's like a giant machine.

11
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,030
More like an efficient team

12
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:42,030
one Bruce hardly needs to worry about.

13
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:46,031
It's what makes the other part of his life possible.

14
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,026
You mean the other part of his life

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,040
in which he appears at museum dedications and fashion shows.

16
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:54,039
I mean, fighting crime.

17
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:56,068
You mean, fighting crimes of fashion.

18
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,065
Dick, he knows I'm The Batman.

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,055
I was a close friend of Bruce's father.

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,055
After the tragedy, I was happy to offer

21
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,092
what little help I could.

22
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,055
It was more than a little.

23
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,062
Lucius helped construct the Batcave.

24
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:15,068
And on the rare occasions he lets me

25
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:18,057
I get to lend a hand with some of the Bat-gadgets.

26
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:21,074
I do love tinkering with the Bat's Shadow Tek.

27
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,077
Oh! Well, then, yay!

28
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,462
So we're just throwing around words

29
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,110
that start with Bat now. That's fun.

30
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,069
Lucius, you clearly have the factory running

31
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:31,078
as smoothly as ever.

32
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:33,083
I don't know why I even bother with these visits.

33
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:36,092
Maybe you just come by to see an old friend.

34
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:38,112
Hm, it doesn't sound like me.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,096
So who else knows?

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,092
Is there a list or something?

37
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,106
Is it on the Internet

38
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,101
brucewayneisbatman.org?

39
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,096
Lucius Fox is the only one

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,321
you didn't already know about.

41
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,100
And he'll be the last.

42
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,113
I try not to make a habit of having

43
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,108
to rely on other people

44
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:04,144
especially to keep my secrets.

45
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:16,123
What? Who are you?

46
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:18,149
Wait.. A-ah!

47
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,201
Can't ID 'em from here.

48
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,202
ID them? I can do that.

49
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:40,219
Bad guys. And pretty ordinary ones, too.

50
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,201
We can handle this.

51
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,219
Uh, didn't we just get in trouble

52
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,210
last week for freelancing?

53
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,221
The boss was very clear.

54
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:49,211
He said to wait while he scoped out the situation.

55
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,244
Okay.

56
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:52,248
We waited.

57
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:05,246
Hey! Uh..

58
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,231
Well, I'm already bored.

59
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,248
Any way to make this more interesting?

60
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:15,834
'We could take them down while reciting'

61
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,271
the alphabet backwards. Aahh!

62
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,286
Gotcha, birdbrains.

63
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,268
Whoosh

64
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,299
thud.

65
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:49,275
Guess they weren't so ordinary after all.

66
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:52,273
Maybe they were those superstrong zombie thugs.

67
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:55,283
We would have had them if you'd waited!

68
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,283
Look, I know being a costumed crime fighter means

69
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:00,286
never having to say I'm sorry.

70
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,301
But, yeah, we're sorry.

71
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,288
No, it's my fault.

72
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:07,286
Maybe I've been relying on you two more than I should.

73
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,324
This never happened when I worked alone.

74
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,349
Detective John Jones. I'm new to the force.

75
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,308
I've heard about you and your mission

76
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,349
to protect Gotham. Admirable.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,354
Did you see what these guys were stealing?

78
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,351
The shipment belonged to your company.

79
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,329
My company?

80
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:50,332
Wayne Industries has had

81
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:51,341
an unusually high volume

82
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:52,343
of shipments going in and out

83
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,333
of the city this week.

84
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,343
It's no surprise that someone with sticky fingers

85
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,353
finally took notice.

86
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:59,343
Mind if I inspect this property

87
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,348
back at my headquarters?

88
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,350
Fine by me, but you'll need

89
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,356
Bruce Wayne's permission.

90
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,349
I can secure it.

91
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,368
I'll bet you can.

92
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,353
It's a new project.

93
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,368
WayneTech research really paid off this time.

94
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,369
We've developed whole new metals, hybrids.

95
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,365
It's pretty exciting if you're into metallurgy.

96
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,374
That's the reason for the extra shipping.

97
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,366
I thought that project was still

98
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,377
at the development stage.

99
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,374
It is, but the development

100
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:31,387
is requiring some supplies.

101
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,391
Really, there's nothing you need to worry about.

102
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:36,395
'You should have those crates sent back here unopened.'

103
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,395
Send them back unopened?

104
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,403
I see. Well, thank you.

105
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,418
Keep working.

106
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,406
Commissioner Gordon vouched for Detective Jones.

107
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,911
And his records from Denver check out.

108
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:14,426
Clang 'Wow!'

109
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,430
But there's nothing before Denver

110
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:18,424
like he didn't exist.

111
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,445
Hey! Uh, a-a-ah..

112
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,467
Okay, it is so my turn.

113
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,435
This is so cool!

114
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,448
I didn't know Wayne Industries made anything like this.

115
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:32,439
We don't, and if Detective Jones is right

116
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,436
my company's been shipping things like this

117
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,443
all over the world.

118
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:37,456
Clearly, this is part of some alien conspiracy

119
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,454
to mass-produce these babies

120
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:40,457
ship 'em all over the world

121
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,441
where they await their signal

122
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:45,486
to take over the human ra-a-ace!

123
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,475
Whoa! Unh!

124
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:51,493
Crash.

125
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,463
New project, huh?

126
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,462
What's it for?

127
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,477
We'll keep an eye on Lucius

128
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,470
but I wanna find out if Jones knows more than he's letting on

129
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,483
about whatever's going on at Wayne Industries.

130
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,509
Then let's pay the detective a visit.

131
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,483
I'll pay him a visit..

132
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,503
Alone.

133
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,552
- Uh, Batman... - Don't bother.

134
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:22,562
I know you're not human.

135
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:39,560
- I suppose this changes things. - Not really.

136
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,575
Click You're coming with me.

137
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,603
I have some questions for you detective.

138
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:51,611
Bam.

139
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:56,592
Humans.

140
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:57,595
You act like you've never seen

141
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,613
a shape-shifter before.

142
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:05,625
Tell that to Clayface.

143
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,628
Crash.

144
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,634
He flies, too.

145
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:48,666
Great.

146
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:53,633
Huh?

147
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:55,664
Let's see if you can keep up.

148
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:56,734
Bang.

149
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,718
I can dance all night. Ugh!

150
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:09,715
- 'So can I.' - So it would seem.

151
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,722
But why waste time? Who are you?

152
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,718
My name is John Jones, I'm a detective

153
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:15,758
just like you..

154
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,740
Bruce.

155
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,753
I'm one of the good guys.

156
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:26,762
Thanks.

157
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,737
So. Alien.

158
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,760
All my life.

159
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,749
Telekinesis. Neat party trick.

160
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:38,738
How heavy can the object be?

161
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:40,738
I could lift you and your best friend

162
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:42,773
that is, if you have one.

163
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:51,766
You miss being back home on Mars?

164
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,760
I never said I was a Martian.

165
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:56,758
Never had to. Martians hate fire.

166
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:58,766
How do you know anything about Martians?

167
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,767
I've dedicated my life to studying all fields

168
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,771
of knowledge, no matter how obscure

169
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,037
including thousands of years of recorded human encounters

170
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,781
with extraterrestrials, the Mayans

171
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:08,782
ancient Egyptians, crop circles.

172
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:10,813
I could teach a college course on Martians

173
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,834
except I always filed them away under urban legends.

174
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,794
Like alligators in the sewers.

175
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,787
I've fought them, too. Why'd you run?

176
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,779
You might have exposed me

177
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:21,796
turned me over to the authorities.

178
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,791
I can't allow that, not now.

179
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,804
Guess we both guard our secrets fiercely.

180
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:28,819
- Coffee? - We're fine, thanks.

181
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:32,801
So how'd you figure out Batman was Bruce Wayne?

182
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,803
- Read your mind. - Hm.

183
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,796
- Something wrong? - No, it's just..

184
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,842
That's cheating. Read my mind now.

185
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,824
- What? - You heard me.

186
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,818
You're thinking of a dog you owned as a boy.

187
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,819
- Location of the Batcave. - I distinctly saw...

188
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:53,819
A mental image I conjured up to block my real thoughts.

189
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,831
Trick I picked up from some Tibetan monks.

190
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:58,825
Anyone ever tell you you're a little paranoid?

191
00:13:58,849 --> 00:13:59,838
My partners, all the time.

192
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,826
I'm stunned. You have partners?

193
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,828
I do, though sometimes I wonder

194
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,838
if things might be easier without them.

195
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:10,838
You may need all the help you can get with what's coming.

196
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,837
'And I've done my homework, Bruce, it is coming.'

197
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,845
- Make no mistake. - What is?

198
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:19,848
Something big, maybe too big for The Batman to handle alone.

199
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,843
Why don't you just tell me what you know and let me

200
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,843
decide what The Batman can handle alone?

201
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:24,862
I'm not the only thing from outer space

202
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,865
that's come to Gotham, but right now

203
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,865
I'm the only thing that can stop it.

204
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,851
- Stop what? - Invasion.

205
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,890
Alien invasion..

206
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,886
The end of your world.

207
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:42,901
Can I get you anything else?

208
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:49,910
Hm..

209
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,899
'They're called The Joining'

210
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:04,890
a synthetic alien race

211
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,899
that's ravaged over half the galaxy

212
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,900
like some plague of locusts

213
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,908
devouring and incorporating the technologies

214
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,910
of every world they encounter.

215
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,911
And they leave nothing in their wake

216
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,898
but empty husks of planets.

217
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,908
Synthetic race. The Joining are robots.

218
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:23,901
Mm-hmm, built by a long-forgotten race

219
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,903
who became their first victims.

220
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:26,924
'And they feed off technology?'

221
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:28,950
Anything industrial, mechanical

222
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,920
they simply take it and use it.

223
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:34,914
It becomes a part of them, it's how they evolve.

224
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,930
That's why they were targeting Wayne Industries.

225
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,920
You're responsible for developing

226
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,964
some of the most advanced technologies on this world.

227
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,952
By the way, nice car.

228
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:57,968
Rang it with my mind.

229
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,960
Batman? What.. Is something wrong?

230
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:04,986
I need to ask you some questions about those shipments.

231
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,952
- Who's this? - This is Detective Jones.

232
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:08,987
- He's here to.. - Hah!

233
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:20,975
'I knew it was a replicant'

234
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,969
'because I didn't get a reading off him.'

235
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:25,972
- 'No emotions.' - 'So you kicked his head off.'

236
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:26,981
Yes.

237
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:29,978
Perhaps I should have mentioned I was going to do that.

238
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:30,981
Perhaps.

239
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,974
This is part of the standard MO

240
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:33,978
of The Joining.

241
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:35,978
Seems pretty complicated.

242
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,993
Not for them, they're a linked system, a network

243
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:40,999
parts of one big machine, really

244
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:44,002
like one huge robot as big as a city.

245
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:48,006
You know, Batman, most humans would be pretty thrown by this.

246
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,030
I'm not most humans.

247
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:55,995
If there's any chance that Lucius is still alive

248
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,004
we have to find him.

249
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:00,026
Then let's ask someone who knows.

250
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:06,035
Great danger.

251
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:11,029
- I can't believe this. - Really? Because robotheads..

252
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:14,013
Well, that's totally what I'm expecting on a Wednesday.

253
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:17,032
And this guy, just some guy waltzing into the Batcave

254
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:19,037
didn't have a blindfold on or anything!

255
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:23,026
Robin, I think we should be focused on the robothead.

256
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,067
Lucius is still alive. You're certain?

257
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:31,034
If you're trying to nod, you need a neck.

258
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,036
He's alive.

259
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,049
The real Lucius is being held

260
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:35,046
at the Wayne Industries factory.

261
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,049
'We are using him for information'

262
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:40,078
'but soon, he will no longer be helpful.'

263
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,060
- Ready? - Find Lucius.

264
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:01,077
Stop alien invasion, save world.

265
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,087
Sounds easy enough.

266
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,108
'Lucius!'

267
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,106
Follow me!

268
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:17,098
How about first one to Lucius wins?

269
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,084
Fine time for him to leave us out of things.

270
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:28,089
Robots. This is like the biggest case we've ever faced!

271
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:29,103
Good robots, too!

272
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,103
That thing looks just like a real person!

273
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:34,096
I know! Anyone we know could be a robot.

274
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,095
Oh, it wouldn't fool us if we knew the person.

275
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,099
- Would it? - Maybe not.

276
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,107
They'd probably be a little roboty

277
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:45,146
detached, unemotional mechanical.

278
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:52,114
- Kick his head off. - You kick his head off.

279
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,123
Attempt to do any such thing, and I assure you

280
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:56,126
there will be no hot, buttered raisin scones

281
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,130
for either of you for a year.

282
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:01,129
Only Alfred sounds that much like Alfred.

283
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:02,154
Yup.

284
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:28,181
It knows we're here.

285
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:46,197
Ping ping ping tzing tzing tzing

286
00:19:53,197 --> 00:20:01,205
thud.

287
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:22,231
Let's call it a tie.

288
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,221
Lucius?

289
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,221
I knew you'd come.

290
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:38,230
- What.. - He's with me, Lucius.

291
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:39,455
We're getting you out of here.

292
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,226
No, forget me. I'm not important.

293
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,253
You don't have much time to..

294
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,268
We're too late.

295
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,265
Told you I could float you and your best friend.

296
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,262
Faster, we don't know how much longer

297
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,293
these things are just gonna sit here.

298
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,291
Bang.

299
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,287
It's begun.

300
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:45,291
- Where are they going? - Anywhere.

301
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,328
Everywhere that's vulnerable..

302
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,330
Everywhere on earth.
