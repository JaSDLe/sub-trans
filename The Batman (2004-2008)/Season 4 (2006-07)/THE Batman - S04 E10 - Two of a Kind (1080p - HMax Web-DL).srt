1
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:12,004
I don't know why

2
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:15,005
but this painting always makes me laugh.

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,011
Punch? Judy? Wrap it up.

4
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:20,012
It'll look nice in the bathroom.

5
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:22,023
'Bathroom?'

6
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,051
I consider the bathroom

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,032
more of a library than art gallery.

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,045
Judy!

9
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:38,046
Huh-uhh!

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,047
Unh-uhh!

11
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,040
Someone should frame that move

12
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:46,044
because it was a masterpiece.

13
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,045
The kids are here

14
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:51,037
but where's the den mother?

15
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,049
Huh?

16
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,040
Hey! Whoa!

17
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,265
Have you seen my latest piece?

18
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,042
It's called bat-bits on canvas.

19
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,077
Ha, ha, ha!

20
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:27,098
Vroom

21
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:34,102
screech boom.

22
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,151
Unh!

23
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,132
Beep beep beep Oops! Gotta run.

24
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:23,137
Ha, ha, ha!

25
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:26,141
Ah-ha, ha, ha!

26
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:29,146
Don't look at me like that. I'm going to be late!

27
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,156
Vroom.

28
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,163
Ahh-ha ha ha!

29
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:55,156
Looks like Joker's gonna need some new goons.

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,621
See if you two can pick up his trail.

31
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,158
I'll join you shortly.

32
00:02:58,182 --> 00:02:59,173
Where are you going?

33
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:02,195
I have to deal with a whole other kind of craziness.

34
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,198
Hurry, hurry! Can't miss it!

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,214
- Yes! - 'Here's Harley!'

36
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:29,189
Mwah! Hiya, folks.

37
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,197
Time for an hour of love and laughter with me

38
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:34,225
Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

39
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:41,212
With Valentine's Day right around the corner.

40
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:44,218
Harley's here with helpful advice.

41
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,222
Talk to me.

42
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,207
'Uh, hi, Harley.'

43
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,214
'Uh, there's this girl I like... '

44
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:50,226
Three words, Romeo.

45
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,227
Flowers, flowers, flowers.

46
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:54,257
And never take "No" for an answer.

47
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,258
Have a good 'un, puddin'.

48
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,235
What's your query, deary?

49
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,226
'Dr. Quinzel, last week'

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,238
'you told a girl named Monica'

51
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:03,242
'to ignore her parent's wishes'

52
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,240
'and go out with a guy named Stan.'

53
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:10,235
I remember. Two sweet, crazy kids in love.

54
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,249
- 'I'm Monica's mother!' - Ehh!

55
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,241
'Where do you come off telling her..'

56
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,253
Umm, heh, sorry, folks.

57
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:17,248
Just some nutcase.

58
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:20,247
I told you to screen those calls.

59
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:22,244
We'll be right back.

60
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:24,278
Think loving thoughts.

61
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,260
Pop psychology at its worst.

62
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,265
That girl's theories are unfounded.

63
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,256
Her professional manner's a joke.

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,270
And her training, if any, is shoddy at best.

65
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:38,276
I love this show!

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,301
The girl's more screw-loose than me!

67
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,309
Oh, Jimmy Herbert, Network Bigwig.

68
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,278
What brings you to the set today?

69
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:53,280
Let me guess. In search of fashion advice?

70
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:57,277
Speaking of advice, what kind are you giving these people?

71
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,293
Are you questioning me?

72
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,283
Everyone who has an online degree

73
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:04,305
in psychology, please raise your hand.

74
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,301
Oh, okay.

75
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:08,294
Then, how about we let the professionals

76
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,297
do their job. Alright, hon?

77
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,296
This show is supposed to help people.

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,295
You've turned it into a circus.

79
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,337
I know!

80
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,302
And you wanna talk circus?

81
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,318
Wait till you see my Valentine's Day special.

82
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:22,307
Look. There won't be a Valentine's Day

83
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,322
special if you keep this...

84
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,324
Oopsies! Gotta get back.

85
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:27,324
Latersville.

86
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:31,315
Welcome back. I've got a real treat for you.

87
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,330
'An exclusive, very intimate one-on-one'

88
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:37,354
'with Gotham's most elusive bachelor..'

89
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,350
Bruce Wayne!

90
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:45,328
Mmm, what's cookin', good-lookin'?

91
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:46,433
- Well, Dr. Quinzel... - Ah!

92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,332
- Oof. Uhh! - Call me Harley.

93
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:51,343
- Everyone does. - Okay, Harley.

94
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,345
I'd like to talk about the Wayne Foundation's.

95
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,351
Charity Drive for crime victims.

96
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,348
Oh, civic-minded, too.

97
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:01,341
But let's talk about your love life.

98
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,487
Now, Harley. You promised I'd have a chance to promote

99
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,372
the charity drive.

100
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,366
We want the juice, Bruce.

101
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,390
This is your secret life, Bruce Wayne!

102
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,379
- Uh-oh. - Bruce?

103
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,366
Oh, yeah.

104
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,409
You remember Kiki, don't you, Brucey?

105
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,382
Uucch!

106
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,392
Well, she remembers you

107
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,420
and she's dishing the dirt!

108
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,380
He-heh.

109
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,397
He's faced some pretty nasty sneak-attacks

110
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,387
but nothing like this.

111
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:47,402
We have to save him.

112
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:48,430
It's too late, Robin.

113
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,401
There's nothing we can do.

114
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,408
So we're having a nice dinner, and suddenly, he's all

115
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:54,412
"I have to see to some important business."

116
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:58,431
Out Bruce Wayne runs, leaving me to pay the check.

117
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,404
Oh, terrible.

118
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:04,436
Just terrible.

119
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,421
About time someone stuck it to that rich oaf.

120
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:12,437
How about we take some calls now?

121
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,431
Hi-hi, you're on "Heart-to-heart with Harley."

122
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:20,436
'Evening, Harley. Mr. J here.'

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,430
'Frequent watcher, frequent caller.'

124
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:23,441
'Great show tonight!'

125
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:26,435
Mr. J, my favorite caller.

126
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,437
Nice to hear from you again.

127
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,441
Well, I just wanted to say men like Bruce Wayne

128
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,439
deserve to be baked into a giant pie

129
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,476
and then launched into the side of a building.

130
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,462
Figuratively speaking, of course.

131
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:44,451
Gotta say, your mind works in interesting ways, Mr. J.

132
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,457
I've had enough of this. I'm outta here.

133
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,454
Uh-oh. Hey!

134
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:50,492
Hold your horses, Brucey.

135
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,457
We're not done yet.

136
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,469
Oh, yes, you are. I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne.

137
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,455
Neither this woman nor this show

138
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,475
will ever trouble you again.

139
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,471
You're no psychologist. You're a joke.

140
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,465
- But... - 'You're off the air!'

141
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:04,486
Wha.. No!

142
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:10,469
Oh, the poor kid! Yanked in mid-show.

143
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,500
She'll be an emotional wreck!

144
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:17,517
Someone should take advantage of that.

145
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,506
Face it, Harley.

146
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,490
No one's ever gonna take you seriously

147
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,501
as a psychologist.

148
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:36,538
They just can't see past my playful exterior.

149
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,528
Story of my life.

150
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,522
- Hello? - 'Dr. Quinzel?'

151
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:51,512
'Forgive the intrusion, but I just had to meet you.'

152
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:53,555
'I'm your number-one fan.'

153
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm Mr. J.

154
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,554
Huh?

155
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:16,559
Must admit, I'm surprised that you wanted to hang out.

156
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:22,544
Most ladies would find my lifestyle... eccentric.

157
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:26,547
Oh, I may act goofy on TV but I'm still a doctor.

158
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,557
Extreme personalities intrigue me.

159
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,565
'And an extreme personality like yours'

160
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,559
might be the ticket to getting back my old show

161
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,576
and maybe finally some respect.

162
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,560
Ohh.

163
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:39,574
So you're stringing old Mr. J along

164
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:41,570
just to write some tell-all book?

165
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,605
I'll split the profits with you 50-50.

166
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:47,585
Ahh-ha, ha, ha!

167
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:50,568
You've got moxie.

168
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:53,595
I feed moxie to the hyenas.

169
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:05,619
Sit!

170
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,591
You're good.

171
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:14,593
Now, what do you say we sit down and, you know

172
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:17,620
have a heart-to-heart with Harley.

173
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:19,631
Hmm.

174
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,646
Oh, where do I begin?

175
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,623
I guess for as long as I remember

176
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:32,610
I always wanted to make people laugh.

177
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:33,650
I see.

178
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:40,633
The neighbors say they saw the doctor

179
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:42,665
leave freely with Mr. J.

180
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,638
Wonder what he could want with her.

181
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:47,630
He saw a vulnerable person he could manipulate.

182
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,644
Someone good for a few laughs, until he got bored.

183
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,633
And join us again next week

184
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,648
when Batman analyzes the Freudian implications

185
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:55,661
of Penguin's umbrella.

186
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:01,644
It's bad enough the Network said

187
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,645
I wasn't a real psychologist.

188
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,665
They said I was a joke.

189
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,674
I happen to like jokes.

190
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,667
Besides, there are worse names.

191
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:17,657
I know. I've been called them.

192
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,693
Guess we have a few things in common, huh?

193
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,675
You know what two sad sacks like us need?

194
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,681
A night on the town!

195
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:33,671
I don't know. That seems awfully unprofessional.

196
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,688
Consider it research for your book.

197
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:37,692
But what if... You're seen associating with

198
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,716
a certified criminal whack-job?

199
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,682
A costume!

200
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,717
That way, no one will know it's you.

201
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,731
Ha, ha!

202
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:58,732
Bling.

203

00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:06,738

00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:11,747

Ooh!

234
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,833
Ha, ha, ha!

235
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:38,821
Aaa-h-h-h!

236
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,833
- Ha, ha, ha! - Aah-h-h!

237
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:49,807
Huh? What was that?

238
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,814
Hi, folks. Don't mind us.

239
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,815
Aah!

240
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,831
Some fun, eh, kid?

241
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,859
Has anyone ever survived a night out with you?

242
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,845
There's a first time for everything.

243
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,830
Leave him alone!

244
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,857
Uhh. Aah!

245
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,851
Unh!

246
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:11,874
'Dr. Quinzel?'

247
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,844
Call me Harley Quinn.

248
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:17,849
What are you doing?

249
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,843
- 'Joker's a psychopath.' - Huh?

250
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,883
Better than what you are. A third wheel.

251
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,848
Huh.

252
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:28,853
Hold this for me, will you? Thanks.

253
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:29,891
- Aah! - Aah-ahh!

254
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,893
Here's our floor!

255
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,879
Hu-ahh!

256
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:36,898
Aa-h-h!

257
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,865
Fear not. Salvation is at hand.

258
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,870
Aa-h-h-h!

259
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:45,878
A little trick I borrowed from Penguin.

260
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:47,910
Remind me to send him a fish.

261
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,908
Ahh-ha ha ha ha!

262
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:07,896
Authorities are at a loss to explain

263
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,891
how the diamond was stolen from the high-security vault

264
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,900
and a police investigation is underway.

265
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:14,937
'In other news, there is still no official word'

266
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,916
'on the bizarre transformation of Dr. Harleen Quinzel.'

267
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,900
Huh?

268
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:21,910
According to eyewitness accounts

269
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,920
the doctor has been sporting a new look

270
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:26,948
while keeping time with Gotham's most wanted wacko.

271
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,909
Noted TV psychologist Elliott Blaine

272
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:30,924
offered this observation.

273
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:34,931
It's no surprise that Dr. Quinzel jumped the track.

274
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,930
She was a sad, needy person

275
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:39,925
who tried to fill the void in her own soul

276
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,966
by dispensing superficial relationship advice to others.

277
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,923
What?

278
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:46,936
I'll have a full profile

279
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,943
of Dr. Quinzel tonight on my prime-time special.

280
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:52,964
Ar-r-r-h-h-h!

281
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:57,947
Unh! You big phony!

282
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:01,947
That was supposed to be my Valentine's special!

283
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,957
Unh!

284
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:04,963
Happy Valentine's Day, kid.

285
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,965
I brought you something.

286
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,975
What?

287
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:13,993
Bling.

288
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,963
Pretty.

289
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:18,972
Aww, I wanted to give you a present

290
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:21,002
for all the fun we've been having.

291
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,978
What is it that you want?

292
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:25,983
Unh! That's what I want?

293
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,986
To get even with those jerks.

294
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,983
I was trying to help people, and now I'm the bad guy?

295
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,990
More of an accomplice, actually.

296
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:36,998
Unh!

297
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:40,018
They should all suffer.

298
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,020
Sounds like a hoot!

299
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,996
What we have with Harleen Quinzel

300
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,999
is a textbook case of a woman

301
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:54,003
deluded by a fantasy image of herself

302
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,999
as a healer and caregiver.

303
00:16:56,023 --> 00:17:00,029
'Hey, doc! I've got a text-bookcase for ya!'

304
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,034
Uhh!

305
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,051
Hi-hi, Gotham!

306
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,043
Harley's back, for a special farewell show.

307
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,048
Unh!

308
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:32,065
'Yoo-hoo.'

309
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:35,048
Keep your seats, people.

310
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:38,080
The little lady's just warming up.

311
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,043
Aww, that's right, puddin'.

312
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,061
I'm going to set the record straight

313
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:49,084
then finish my broadcasting career with a big bang.

314
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:52,059
- Let's go. - What?

315
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,080
We can't wait for the commercial?

316
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,097
So, you didn't like my show?

317
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,101
Well, try this one.

318
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:12,083
"When Animals Attack People I Hate."

319
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,100
It's a comedy.

320
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,101
Huh! Hah!

321
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:23,106
You're cancelled. Again.

322
00:18:24,113 --> 00:18:26,106
Ar-r-r-r.

323
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,132
Huh!

324
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,113
Aww, thanks, sweetie.

325
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:43,108
Now drag her outside and Joker gas her or something.

326
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:46,106
You ordering me around?

327
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,119
Don't go too far.

328
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:51,113
I've indulged you only because it amused me.

329
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,148
Yes, sir.

330
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,126
Hee, hee, hee. You little imp.

331
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,149
I could never stay mad at you.

332
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,145
Uh-oh.

333
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,132
- Ugh! - Aah!

334
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:09,159
Uhh, uhh. Ah!

335
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:12,147
- Uhh. - Uhh.

336
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:14,137
Rr-r-r-r!

337
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,146
- Uhh. - Don't move.

338
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,152
Very funny.

339
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:20,146
Unh! Aah!

340
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,163
You bats won't pull the plug on my special.

341
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:31,166
What have you done?

342
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,195
They sent me down in flames.

343
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,166
So I'm returning the favor.

344
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,175
Ehh-ha, ha, ha!

345
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,172
There are three more bombs

346
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:43,173
planted around this building.

347
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:46,169
Once they go, all Gotham broadcasting

348
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:47,185
comes tumblin' down!

349
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,210
Show the man, Harley!

350
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,179
Ahh!

351
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:54,211
Not gonna happen.

352
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:56,209
Uh-unh.

353
00:19:58,202 --> 00:19:59,213
Unh.

354
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,218
Ya-a-h-h!

355
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,192
I'm okay. Help the audience.

356
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:08,217
Unh!

357
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:16,235
Unh.

358
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,235
This way, people.

359
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,266
Time to make tracks, boys.

360
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,222
So long, little Harley Quinn.

361
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,250
It's been fun!

362
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:02,256
The Joker doesn't care about anyone but himself.

363
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,244
He never has, and he never will.

364
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:08,274
You'd think a psychologist would know better.

365
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:24,284
Huh?

366
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:31,302
Ha, ha, ha!
