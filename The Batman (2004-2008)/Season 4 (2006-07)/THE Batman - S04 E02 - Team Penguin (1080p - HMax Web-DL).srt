1
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,018
Whirr.

2
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,039
Let's do this.

3
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,035
Asleep at the wheel?

4
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,043
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

5
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:06,071
Huh?

6
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:10,092
'Report. What's your status?'

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,055
Still single. Haven't met the right girl. I guess.

8
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,057
"Security system off-line."

9
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,088
Oh, and we're in.

10
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,094
MacGuffin secured.

11
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:38,079
I love this movie!

12
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:41,081
Do you mind? We can't see.

13
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:44,084
What I mind is back-seat yakety-yak

14
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,117
while I'm trying to watch a movie!

15
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,112
Teamwork, boys.

16
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:58,141
Now, that's a blueprint for success.

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,115
You said it, general.

18
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:04,104
Hmm? Hmm.

19
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:08,117
A team at Gotham's greatest villains to do the job

20
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:11,114
we haven't been able to do alone.

21
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:16,114
Clip the bat jerk's wings permanently.

22
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:18,160
Now, that is a blueprint for success.

23
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:37,174
Beep

24
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,173
vroom

25
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,174
boom

26
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:02,194
vroom

27
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:09,195
clang

28
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:32,220
crash Huh?

29
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:39,203
"An invitation to join Team Penguin?"

30
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:42,205
Let me guess, Bane.

31
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,229
ATM ate your card?

32
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:50,242
Crash

33
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,250
thud.

34
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,225
I know, I know. Wait for backup.

35
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,251
Someone say "backup?"

36
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,245
Uh, who's the pixie?

37
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,268
Robin, official partner to the Dark Knight.

38
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:25,283
Clang clang clang.

39
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,261
Robin, distraction maneuver, like we practiced.

40
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,294
On it.

41
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,288
He's had training?

42
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,272
He's got moves.

43
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:49,269
Let's see how he likes mine.

44
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:50,280
Huh?

45
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:53,314
- Mine. - Robin, stick to the plan.

46
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,303
Crackle crackle crackle.

47
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,298
So you got a new partner.

48
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:18,317
It's because I changed the presets

49
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,330
on the Batmobile radio, isn't it?

50
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:35,314
Well, Penguin.

51
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,360
I guess that means old Bane is out.

52
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,322
This kind of thing is exactly

53
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:45,324
why I've been saying we need to team up, Croc.

54
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:49,333
In that case, we better fire up our recruitment drive.

55
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,341
I concur with Firefly.

56
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:56,336
But one can't simply pull a super-criminal out of a hat.

57
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,377
Ragdoll.

58
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,377
I told you not to do that.

59
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,344
So we still need our fifth.

60
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:08,354
Recruitment is my job, thank you very much.

61
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:11,359
And besides, they all said no already.

62
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:14,361
But leave it to me to find the best of the rest.

63
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:17,377
'Someone say "best?"'

64
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,366
Killer Moth.

65
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,380
Heard the legendary Penguin was recruiting.

66
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:27,410
I'm here to throw in.

67
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,378
Listen, mothball.

68
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,392
There's only room for one killer here.

69
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,392
That's Killer Croc.

70
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,395
Huh? Ugh.

71
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,400
Huh, nice wings. Granny make them?

72
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:46,395
Now, now, give the man a chance.

73
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,390
What are your special talents?

74
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:49,406
Attraction to bright lights?

75
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,390
Eating holes in sweaters?

76
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:54,396
Listen, I can help you guys.

77
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,401
I got a lot of skills.

78
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,414
Do enlighten us, Moth.

79
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:02,420
Well, I got stealth skills, code-breaking skills

80
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:06,410
karate skills, cocooning skills.

81
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:10,419
Splosh What about coffee-making skills?

82
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:13,433
I take mine black. Two lumps.

83
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:20,439
Penguin's recruiting a gang.

84
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:21,464
Keep a low center.

85
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,463
I understand teamwork's all the rage.

86
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,458
Eyes on your opponent.

87
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,447
What? It's only practice.

88
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:41,447
We're partners, but you need to follow my lead.

89
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,446
You didn't earlier, and it almost got you

90
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,454
and Batgirl in trouble.

91
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,446
Hey, I'm not the problem.

92
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,472
She's the one flying solo.

93
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:07,478
Gentlemen, tonight we show Gotham, and the bat jerks

94
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,489
the power of Team Penguin.

95
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:14,481
What if we call ourselves the Gotham Gangstas?

96
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:16,495
Team Penguin is not up for debate!

97
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,516
Now, let's do this!

98
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,513
You see the game last night? Huh?

99
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:46,545
- Boo! - Huh?

100
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,541
Beep beep beep.

101
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:08,537
We're in. But the only thing here is some chemical.

102
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,535
That's the dingus. Grab it.

103
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,571
Yes, siree, this is a blueprint for success.

104
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,564
Mm, robust.

105
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,552
Let's move.

106
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,558
All in good time, gentlemen.

107
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:26,546
A light in the sky says we're about to have company.

108
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,576
Vroom

109
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,575
screech.

110
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:37,562
Hard or easy? Your choice.

111
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:40,561
Please say hard. I need the training.

112
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:43,586
Looks like I'm not the only one with a lackey.

113
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,577
Who's the lackey now, huh?

114
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,571
Sir?

115
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,587
You might want to cut back on his sugar intake.

116
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,601
Penguin's not alone.

117
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,577
Ki-ya!

118
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:58,595
I think we can take him.

119
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:01,614
Not him. Them.

120
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,599
Freeze.

121
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:16,597
Splosh Huh?

122
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:17,636
Zap zap zap.

123
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,662
- I got him. - I saw him first.

124
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,675
Firefly, high and long.

125
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:09,685
Rumble rumble.

126
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,673
'Great teamwork, boys.'

127
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:20,660
Let's pop a few corks to celebrate.

128
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,690
Slash

129
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:29,710
zap

130
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,719
beep.

131
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,718
- Stay down. - Not a problem.

132
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,725
Whoosh

133
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,715
boom.

134
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:03,712
Bats sure went out with a bang.

135
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,704
Yeah? We <i>always think that.</i>

136
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:07,718
It doesn't matter.

137
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:12,713
We kicked those bat butts once, we can do it again.

138
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:13,730
Tonight proved it.

139
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:16,716
Team Penguin is unstoppable.

140
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,720
How about Villains United?

141
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,745
How about you shut up?

142
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,731
Nice teamwork. Real effective.

143
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:26,744
Would have been if you'd stayed out of my way

144
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:29,734
instead of hogging the ball.

145
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,741
They stole a highly unstable chemical.

146
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,734
Penguin may not realize it, but as long as

147
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,745
it's in their possession, his team is in danger.

148
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,780
I doubt anyone on that crew can even spell danger.

149
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,441
They handled themselves better than we did.

150
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,746
I know, follow your lead. What's the plan, then?

151
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,755
Drop off the third wheel and regroup back at the hideout?

152
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,751
He's been to the hideout?

153
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,750
Well, you might as well just go ahead

154
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,780
and tell him your secret identity.

155
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:57,799
He knows? Of course he does.

156
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,797
After all, he's been your partner now for a whole week.

157
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,804
Hey, where are we?

158
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,775
Yeah, why are we going here?

159
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,805
Vroom.

160
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,824
A cave? Really milking this whole

161
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,084
creature-of-the-night theme, huh?

162
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:30,832
Bruce Wayne? Knew it.

163
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,832
And that makes you Dick Grayson.

164
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,831
And you are?

165
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,819
Sorry, as a not-quite-official freelancer

166
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:43,815
I have to go the extra mile to protect my privacy.

167
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,813
She's Barbara Gordon.

168
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:48,831
Gordon? As in the commish's kid?

169
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,829
Gentlemen, the target.

170
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:59,822
The stately mansion of Gotham's own software billionaire.

171
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:00,835
Robert Howard.

172
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,865
No one's been able to break into that place. I've tried.

173
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,830
Did you have a team of specialists

174
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:08,830
to take out his security systems

175
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:10,834
and a super-chemical to eat through

176
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:13,851
five layers of laser-proof titanium vault?

177
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,840
It's teamwork that's going to get us in there.

178
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:19,842
And it's teamwork that's going to net us.

179
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,856
Howard's recently purchased

180
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,881
one-of-a-kind ruby-encrusted Penguin.

181
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:31,853
I knew it.

182
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,857
This is about a stupid bird.

183
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,861
Well, this time, it's a bird.

184
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,874
Next time, it can be an alligator.

185
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:42,867
Now, where's my lackey with the chemical?

186
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:46,867
Having acquired the secret elixir for his general.

187
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,910
Special Ops Moth approached...

188
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,889
The... The rendezvous point...

189
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,909
The rendezvous point.

190
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,904
'At room temperature, the chemical is a nearly'

191
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,892
universal solvent.'

192
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:12,901
Then it would seem to be useful

193
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,915
for any number of nefarious purposes.

194
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,906
Sorry, circus boy, but you can't beat Olympic gymnastics

195
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,908
for teaching acrobatic skills.

196
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:23,913
How many times have you performed

197
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,919
a triple aerial somersault?

198
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:26,946
Dozens.

199
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,958
Fifty feet up without a net over hungry lions?

200
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,943
I don't know if they were hungry.

201
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,936
They're hitting Robert Howard's mansion.

202
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,946
- Shotgun. - Great.

203
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,965
Why doesn't he just drive us there too?

204
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,991
'What is that?'

205
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,969
Ugh. It's Moth.

206
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,961
Was him, anyway.

207
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,977
- Poor guy. - Must have been the fumes.

208
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,973
I feel awful.

209
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,976
We'll buy him a wreath with the profits.

210
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,986
Now, grab the canister and let's do this.

211
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,977
You couldn't lead us out of a paper bag.

212
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,012
I'm gone.

213
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:34,986
Quitter, eh? Fine.

214
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,993
More for the rest of us.

215
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:40,013
Guys? Where are you going?

216
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:42,021
Splosh.

217
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,029
Huh?

218
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,016
What?

219
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I have something on my face, don't I?

220
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,027
Well, well, well.

221
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:20,034
Maybe now I'll start getting some respect.

222
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,063
Now, as for Penguin.

223
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:27,039
He's our leader, so you guys are gonna start

224
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,048
showing him the respect he deserves.

225
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:32,047
- Oh, yeah, you bet. - Of course.

226
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:34,057
A-anything he wants.

227
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,078
You heard him.

228
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,046
Anybody that has a problem taking orders from me

229
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,053
deals with him.

230
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:44,044
You, fetch the chemical from the truck.

231
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:48,072
- Me? - Wait. Maybe we don't need it.

232
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,057
Looks like your makeover gave you some new skills.

233
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,067
Forget the chemicals.

234
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,064
Moth's everything I need.

235
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:00,058
Uh, <i>we need.</i>

236
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:03,079
Now, let's see what you can do with those wings.

237
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:06,107
Whoosh

238
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,102
vroom.

239
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:20,089
Three against five is hardly fair.

240
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:23,092
I count four. Where's Tommy Tagalong?

241
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:27,114
Oh, Mothy? He's around.

242
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:35,136
Whoa. What happened to him?

243
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm going with hit by a radioactive mothball

244
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:41,114
from outer space.

245
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,143
Attack!

246
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:48,117
I've been thinking.

247
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:51,120
Who needs a team when I have you?

248
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:53,152
Climb aboard, sir.

249
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,148
Show us your stuff, Moth.

250
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:05,149
Crackle crackle.

251
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:38,199
Please, let's not make this too easy for me.

252
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:56,199
You think a little water's gonna stop me?

253
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:02,213
No, but maybe a little ice will.

254
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:07,224
Boom crackle crackle crackle

255
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:22,218
crackle crackle 'There it is.'

256
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:26,225
'The stuff that dreams are made of.'

257
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:30,231
Happy birthday to me.

258
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:33,247
And it's not even my birthday.

259
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:55,254
You're mine.

260
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,248
Listen, I'll handle Moth.

261
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,248
You find your own roof to play on.

262
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:01,276
Fine.

263
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,271
Huh?

264
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:08,285
Up here.

265
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:10,291
Okay. Yours.

266
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:13,273
Crash.

267
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,276
Hey, get off of my back.

268
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,266
Yee-haw!

269
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,303
Any final words before you part?

270
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,266
Prepare for landing.

271
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,274
Huh? What landing?

272
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,274
Sir. Sir, look out.

273
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,299
Crash.

274
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,285
Huh?

275
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:49,317
Now that's a blueprint for success.

276
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:57,304
Blue ribbon in the insect rodeo.

277
00:21:57,328 --> 00:21:59,301
You're not so bad after all.

278
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:02,329
Well, it was your distraction that made it possible.

279
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:08,310
Of course, leaving yourself

280
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,308
so exposed like that is completely reckless.

281
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:13,352
Oh, yeah? Who crashed the giant moth monster into the root?

282
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,319
You'll be 40 before you get to drive the Batmobile.

283
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,350
At least I'll get to drive it.
