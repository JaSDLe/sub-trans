1
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,044
I do love spendin' afternoons in the old fishin' hole.

2
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,040
Unh..

3
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:33,017
Let's see what we hooked, boys.

4
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,048
Here we go.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:44,048
Huh?

6
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:50,046
Hidin' in the shadows?

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,076
Huh. Since when do I need to see you to find you, Batman?

8
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,066
You're not bats.

9
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,048
Huh?

10
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:08,080
Aah!

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,088
Whoever you are, you are meat.

12
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,091
Aah!

13
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:42,111
What the.. What is this?

14
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,113
This?

15
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,105
This is the end..

16
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,125
For all of you.

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,148
Boom

18
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:37,168
whoosh.

19
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,269
'Killer Croc is the latest'

20
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,384
of the so-called rogues' gallery criminals to disappear.

21
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,169
And witnesses are calling it the work of a new vigilante

22
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:10,168
patrolling our city streets.

23
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:11,190
Now, questions are being raised

24
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:13,215
as to whether there's room in Gotham

25
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,184
for two costumed crime fighters.

26
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,195
The only hero Gotham needs is this new guy.

27
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:22,187
With the Batman, those crackpots never stayed locked up for long.

28
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,773
I say it's time the Bat hang up his cape

29
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,189
and call it a night.

30
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,191
'Let a new hero actually get the job done.'

31
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,205
It's not like it's your fault

32
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:30,227
they keep escaping from Arkham.

33
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:32,235
Time for work.

34
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,228
Whoosh.

35
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,229
Rag Doll, Moth, Firefly..

36
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,236
They were all here.

37
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,230
And all taken down by a mystery vigilante.

38
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,266
This new hero's not leaving much work for us, huh?

39
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,243
He's no hero.

40
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:08,237
If he were, he'd hand these criminals over to the police.

41
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,462
Instead, he's collecting them.

42
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,233
The question is why.

43
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:15,267
Beep Break-in at the art museum.

44
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:28,262
Mm. I know the <i>purr-fect place for you.</i>

45
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:32,254
Try back where you found it.

46
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:35,259
Batman, my favorite stalker.

47
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,272
Ooh, and another new kid partner.

48
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:40,277
Is that because they make you look taller?

49
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,262
Achoo!

50
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:44,265
Sorry, allergic to cats..

51
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,283
And bad jokes.

52
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:49,269
Now, handsome, how did you know to find me here?

53
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,271
I thought I was being careful.

54
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:54,279
Nothing screams careful like a brick through the window.

55
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:57,284
Someone else tripped the alarm and on purpose.

56
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:59,296
I see you got my message.

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,287
Took you long enough to get here!

58
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:03,302
- Penguin! - Quack!

59
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:05,290
Unh. Huh?

60
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,304
Wait. Let's find out what he wants.

61
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:11,307
What I want is to turn myself in.

62
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,310
'Come on!'

63
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,295
Chop, chop.

64
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,323
Let's go. Pat me down.

65
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:19,313
Have to catch me in the act.

66
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,312
Is that it?

67
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,341
Okay, uh, look..

68
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:26,343
I'm stealing.

69
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,314
What, not enough?

70
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:34,329
Then you should know that, soon all of Gotham will suffer

71
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:38,329
some cruel ironic bird-related fate

72
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:41,358
at the hands of El Penguino!

73
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:45,325
What's a felon gotta pull

74
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,335
to get arrested around here?

75
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,366
Uh, you're embarrassing yourself.

76
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,344
Listen, I'm beggin' you.

77
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:56,350
I need your protection from that new guy!

78
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,353
He's not like you, Batman.

79
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,350
He's scary... er.

80
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,357
Ha! There's no new guy.

81
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:05,371
That's a rumor.

82
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:08,391
Huh? What? Aah.

83
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:10,393
Whoa!

84
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,378
Crackle.

85
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:18,364
The thing about rumors..

86
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,388
They're often true.

87
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:25,376
You get one chance, Batman.

88
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,390
Step away from the low-life scum.

89
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,408
Alright then.

90
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:36,419
Ding clang - Excuse me. - Aah.

91
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,392
I don't like that kid.

92
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,386
Ha! Wha..

93
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,390
Unh!

94
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,397
Ow. That hurt.

95
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,400
No point in not stickin' around.

96
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,416
Comin', toots?

97
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:55,424
Swish tick tick tick.

98
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:05,411
'Sorry, Bats.'

99
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,429
'The suit absorbs my body heat.'

100
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,437
slam.

101
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,455
There you are.

102
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,449
Aah!

103
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,439
Aah! Oh, no!

104
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,475
Batman!

105
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,448
Rumor's good.

106
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,459
He keeps disappearing without a trace.

107
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:46,483
Not this time.

108
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,465
Crackle crackle.

109
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,498
'Rumor's using light-refracting nano-fibers'

110
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,463
'to become invisible.'

111
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:58,473
The only company in Gotham

112
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,471
developing that kind of tech is Karon Industries..

113
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,503
As in, Paul Karon.

114
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:21,485
Our captor continues to captivate me.

115
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,488
I wonder what it is that motivates him.

116
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,503
And if there is some ultimate punishment

117
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,498
he has awaiting us.

118
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,498
Punishment?

119
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,508
You mean something worse than being stuck here

120
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:34,517
listening to you?

121
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:43,503
I have bad news, and I have worse news.

122
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,520
'The bad news is'

123
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:47,516
'I've sentenced all of you to life.'

124
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,508
The worse news is

125
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:52,520
it's going to be a very short sentence.

126
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:55,513
However, before I can carry it out.

127
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:59,546
'I still have one very special piece to add.'

128
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,547
- Ready, Mr. Karon? - Two minutes, Mario.

129
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,572
I'm here if you need me.

130
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,566
Paul Karon.

131
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:17,549
Why, if it isn't the people's hero.

132
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,542
Oh, wait, heard a rumor

133
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,557
someone more qualified has that job now.

134
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,547
This new vigilante

135
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,559
he's been using technology developed by you

136
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,562
to abduct criminals from Gotham.

137
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,553
Well, if you find him

138
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,555
tell him I want to shake his hand.

139
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,557
Any idea how he got your stuff?

140
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,556
Maybe it fell off a truck.

141
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,599
Maybe it isn't my stuff.

142
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,590
And maybe, I just don't care.

143
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,566
Oh.

144
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,583
You haven't told him where we've met before

145
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:48,578
have you, Batman?

146
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:51,581
<i>Not long ago I developed a tool that could emit</i>

147
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,579
<i>low frequency sound waves</i>

148
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:56,610
<i>so powerful they could destroy a building.</i>

149
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:04,623
<i>The government was very interested..</i>

150
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:06,623
Crash

151
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:12,620
<i>but so was Joker.</i>

152
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:16,615
<i>Of course, the Batman</i>

153
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,626
<i>would heroically arrive.</i>

154
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:25,637
Thud whoosh boom

155
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,642
clatter clatter.

156
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:33,636
<i>Batman saved the day.</i>

157
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,644
<i>But not me.</i>

158
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:41,928
These villains weren't <i>in Gotham</i>

159
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,623
before Batman took to the streets.

160
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,625
He's attracted them like moths to light.

161
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,643
And now he can barely contain them.

162
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:52,633
Gotham's better off because of the Batman.

163
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:54,669
I, certainly, am not.

164
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:58,653
Now, if you're done interrogating the victim

165
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:00,678
why don't you get out of here?

166
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,671
Ready?

167
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,659
So where do we go now?

168
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,676
Who says we're done here?

169
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:21,668
And what are we looking for?

170
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,666
We'll know when we see it.

171
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,691
Oh. It's gonna be <i>one of those nights.</i>

172
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:30,686
'Cool. What is this stuff?'

173
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,673
"Exo Legs?"

174
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:34,683
'Anything else you need, boss?'

175
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,684
'No, thank you, Mario.'

176
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,721
'Go home... get some sleep.'

177
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,693
Okay, but, are you sure you want me to leave you here?

178
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:44,696
I may not be 100%, my friend

179
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,695
but, I can still handle myself in the lab.

180
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,691
Now, go. I'll see ya in the morning.

181
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,722
Okay, boss. Goodnight.

182
00:11:57,736 --> 00:12:00,739
Whirr.

183
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,732
'A super-powered exoskeleton'

184
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,751
'and a company that makes secret stealth suits..'

185
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:35,748
He's our guy.

186
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,752
We should've kicked his butt <i>last night.</i>

187
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,738
We don't know where he's keeping his victims.

188
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,748
If we're going to find them

189
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,757
we'll have to catch Paul Karon in the act.

190
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,744
Wouldn't everyone be better off

191
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,748
if we just let Karon finish the job?

192
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:50,767
The code we work by isn't always the easiest way, Robin.

193
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,789
But it's the right way.

194
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,778
Whoosh.

195
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:07,784
Uh, heh-heh, he loved the show!

196
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,788
Physical comedy is truly an art.

197
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:12,784
'World's deadliest disasters'

198
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,783
'will continue after these messages.'

199
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:15,817
crash.

200
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,781
You know, I admit, when Punch and Judy

201
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:25,783
didn't check in the other night, I started to worry.

202
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,795
It was only a matter of time before this Rumor

203
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:28,802
came a-courtin' me.

204
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:29,831
So I decided..

205
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,802
Why sit around waiting?

206
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:33,820
Be proactive!

207
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,811
Oh, boys.

208
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:38,796
Let's show our new friend

209
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,834
he's welcome at Uncle Joker's hospitality hut.

210
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,813
Huh? Oh!

211
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:51,848
Aah! Whoa!

212
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,813
Huh?

213
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:56,846
Whoa!

214
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,842
Mm.

215
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:05,826
Huh?

216
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,856
Oh, man!

217
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:16,862
Huh?

218
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:27,890
Joker was taken tonight.

219
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,867
Didn't think you had it in ya.

220
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,867
Congratulations.

221
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,886
It wasn't us.

222
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,900
Anything you'd like to confess?

223
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,898
Do I really need an alibi?

224
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,905
We know about your Exo-Suit.

225
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,873
When I was hurt, I realized the suit

226
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,881
had non-military applications.

227
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:55,874
I've been testing it..

228
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,915
Looking for a way to help people like me.

229
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,902
Hardly a crime, Batman.

230
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:05,928
I heard voices.

231
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:07,893
Everything okay, Mr. Karon?

232
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,906
If you don't believe me, ask Theo.

233
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,926
'He's been with me all day.'

234
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,893
Where's your bodyguard from the other night?

235
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,926
Mario? It's his night off. Why?

236
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:28,939
Whirr whirr whirr

237
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,936
thud thud thud.

238
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,918
Time's up, my friends.

239
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:40,923
'Ahem.'

240
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:41,936
Excuse me.

241
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,941
Before you send us all to that

242
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:46,941
big Arkham Asylum in the sky

243
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,932
would you mind indulging an old man's

244
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,940
intellectual curiosity

245
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,948
and answer a simple question?

246
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:59,945
Why? I'll tell you why.

247
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm the bodyguard of Paul Karon.

248
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,950
A great man.

249
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:06,944
A man, you, Joker, maimed.

250
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:07,949
Me?

251
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,951
I should have known this was Joker's fault.

252
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:12,951
Just had to make that boy angry.

253
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:13,964
Don't blame Joker.

254
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:14,973
Blame the Bat.

255
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:16,967
He had the chance to permanently

256
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:18,969
stop each and every one of you

257
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:22,963
'but was always prevented by some code of ethics.'

258
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:26,001
Now I'm left to finish a job he doesn't have the guts to.

259
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,981
And you believe every word of that, don't you?

260
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:34,983
'You didn't capture us so you could save Gotham.'

261
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:38,977
'No, you're trying to erase your own failure'

262
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,988
'of not saving your boss.'

263
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,017
That's not true. Shut up!

264
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:47,006
Karon's sonic weapon..

265
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,991
Once it's warmed up, it's gonna destroy

266
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:55,007
every super-villain in Gotham in one fell swoop.

267
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,997
You have nothing to prove, Mario.

268
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,008
Probably shouldn't use

269
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:01,017
one of your boss' old factories as a hideout.

270
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,040
He helped you find me?

271
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,046
But this was for him.

272
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,011
Even he felt you crossed a line.

273
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,021
Maybe it's a line

274
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:12,038
<i>you should have crossed,</i> too, Batman.

275
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:22,058
Aah.

276
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,063
Crackle crackle.

277
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,100
'Mind if we cut in, Batsy?'

278
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,092
You see, there's this nasty little rumor

279
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:23,103
we'd all like to stomp out.

280
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:26,097
You have to save me.

281
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:28,109
I know.

282
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,101
Let me guess, this is one of those.

283
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,131
"Not the easy way, but the right way" moments?

284
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,141
Boom

285
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,166
whoosh

286
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,152
clang

287
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,170
slam

288
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,177
crackle crackle.

289
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:40,181
Aah! Whoa!

290
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:46,204
Whoosh

291
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,235
thud.

292
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,248
This counts as overtime, right?

293
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,264
Crackle crackle.

294
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:58,261
You know, I bet there was an off button.

295
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:06,263
How can you do this?

296
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,263
They had to be stopped!

297
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:11,268
They're the criminals. Them! Not me!

298
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,279
Not me!

299
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,289
Meow.

300
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,286
Just wanted to say thanks, handsome.

301
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,276
And by the way..

302
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,311
I still find you scary.
