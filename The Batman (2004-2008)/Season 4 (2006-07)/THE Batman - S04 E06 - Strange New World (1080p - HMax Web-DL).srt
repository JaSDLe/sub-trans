1
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:12,035
<i>Combat log, final entry.</i>

2
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,003
<i>Should I fail, let this be a record</i>

3
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:17,002
<i>for those who come after me.</i>

4
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:20,042
<i>Two nights ago, a madman unleashed a plague on Gotham</i>

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,006
<i>turning the infected into what I can only describe</i>

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,014
<i>as zombies.</i>

7
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:28,013
<i>Mindless drones at his command.</i>

8
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:30,023
<i>I'd say it's a nightmare..</i>

9
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,028
<i>But it can't be</i>

10
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,043
<i>because I haven't slept in days.</i>

11
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>The pieces are now in place.</i>

12
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,078
<i>I have one chance to save this city.</i>

13
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:03,071
'No!'

14
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,184
<i>Hard to believe this all started 48 hours ago.</i>

15
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:46,160
'"I am proud to accept this award on behalf of all'

16
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:49,192
"who work to ensure that Gotham will once again stand proud

17
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,194
as a shining beacon to a brighter future."

18
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,173
- What do you think, Dick? - Sure.

19
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:56,160
You could give that speech..

20
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:58,157
Or to save time

21
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,168
I could fly over in the Batwing

22
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,166
and drop knock-out gas on the crowd.

23
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,204
I for one, hung on every word.

24
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:08,167
Still, I'll see to it that pillows and blankets

25
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:11,181
are available for those who may require them.

26
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,189
Don't worry, sir, we still have two more days

27
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,174
to work on the speech before Gotham honors

28
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,184
the good works of Bruce Wayne.

29
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,178
And speaking of good works

30
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:23,208
it seems the city requires some from the Batman.

31
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:30,195
'Dr. Hugo Strange is requesting to see you. He won't say why.'

32
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:33,226
'I doubt it's to thank me for the new accommodations.'

33
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,059
Be careful what you say in front of him, Robin.

34
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,205
Strange may be a madman

35
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,211
but he's also a brilliant psychiatrist.

36
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:44,238
If he finds an opening, he'll mess with your head.

37
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:03,236
I don't usually make house calls, doctor.

38
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,233
- What do you want? - Thank you for coming, Batman.

39
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,245
And what I want is your help

40
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,251
with an experiment I'm conducting.

41
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,244
You see, I'm going to release

42
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:18,236
a toxic agent into Gotham's air.

43
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,251
It's odorless, invisible, and extremely fast-acting.

44
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:24,243
<i>It will twist the body and weaken the mind</i>

45
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:28,261
<i>turning those infected into monstrous living drones.</i>

46
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:32,270
<i>Zombies, answerable only to me.</i>

47
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:34,272
<i>Each victim, in turn</i>

48
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:38,301
<i>will become a carrier, infecting others.</i>

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
<i>Sadly, if the antidote isn't administered</i>

50
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:45,277
<i>within 48 hours of infection</i>

51
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:48,310
the condition becomes irreversible.

52
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:53,315
If the toxin is being released everywhere

53
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,289
why won't you be affected, Strange?

54
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:59,285
I've already taken the antidote

55
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:03,309
which I'm sure could be very useful to you.

56
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:06,310
Oops.

57
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,307
Oh, that would mean the toxin is being dispersed

58
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,322
throughout Gotham as we speak.

59
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:21,342
Robin, filter on.

60
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:26,318
And now that you're safe from the toxin

61
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:29,349
perhaps we'll watch Gotham go down together.

62
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:33,346
Let the games begin.

63
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:51,369
Get them!

64
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,387
This isn't over, Strange.

65
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:09,383
You're right, Batman. It's just beginning.

66
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,385
'Collecting air sample.'

67
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,391
How did Strange pull it off?

68
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,381
With clinical precision.

69
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:36,384
- I wanna know why. - 'Sir?'

70
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,383
Hugo Strange has released a toxic agent

71
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,393
into the city's air. Stay in the cave.

72
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,383
The filter system should keep you safe.

73
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,427
And notify Barbara. We'll need back-up.

74
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,410
'Straight away, sir.'

75
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:51,412
'Analysis complete.'

76
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,437
The chemical analysis shows nothing weird.

77
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,405
The air is safe to breathe.

78
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,402
The toxin must have dispersed quickly

79
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:01,436
after doing its damage. But the drones are carriers.

80
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,444
Commissioner?

81
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,450
No!

82
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:39,481
Orders.

83
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,446
Arkham.

84
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,481
Batman.

85
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:55,462
Batgirl, I'll totally deny I said this

86
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:57,495
'but having you here doesn't completely..'

87
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,489
stink?

88
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,483
Aah!

89
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,499
Aa-aa-aa!

90
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,546
I know. We'll get them back, Dick. I promise.

91
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:16,545
'Hair?'

92
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,538
Whatever toxin Strange used

93
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:19,556
if it's in the victims tissues

94
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,558
'we can identify it from this.'

95
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,571
You help Alfred research.

96
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,584
'Alfred?'

97
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,588
Sick.

98
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:51,609
Rest easy, old friend.

99
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,589
How'd he get infected down here?

100
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,617
I don't know. But I intend to find out.

101
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:10,604
Combat log.

102
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:11,909
I've checked against every known

103
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,602
infectious agent and toxic compound.

104
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:17,632
No match. There has to be a variable we're not seeing.

105
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,602
No!

106
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:27,606
You, help... Stop it! Stop it!

107
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,623
Dick, I need you to focus.

108
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:31,615
It's not fair. We're all alone.

109
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,618
Alfred, Batgirl, the whole city's infected

110
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:36,643
and we don't even know why.

111
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,649
But there's one man who does.

112
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:56,679
Tell me, Batman, what do you see?

113
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:05,654
That you're still crazy about me, Strange.

114
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,680
Now, how do I save everyone?

115
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,659
And rob myself of the chance to peer behind the mask

116
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:16,672
at the moment of the Batman's greatest defeat?

117
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:18,666
You wanna see behind the mask?

118
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,668
Give me the antidote, and I'll remove it.

119
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:24,688
Of course. You first.

120
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,677
The truth is, you saw me spill my last sample.

121
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,686
Sample? Then there's more antidote.

122
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,676
Where is it, Strange?

123
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,695
It's true, I wanted a small quantity of it

124
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,685
stashed away for my experiments.

125
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:45,727
Sadly, last week an orderly found it.

126
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,707
I believe it is in police custody now.

127
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:52,691
Feel free to borrow it.

128
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:55,713
Of course, with all those zombies running round

129
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:58,703
I don't think I'd feel comfortable

130
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:02,726
going into that neighborhood alone.

131
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,707
- Robin. - We are finished here, Batman.

132
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,749
Guards, there is a bat in my belfry.

133
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,739
Combat log. Second night.

134
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,753
Robin's gone. I'm alone.

135
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,762
'And I have less than a day to distribute'

136
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,778
'Strange's antidote to the entire city.'

137
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:54,755
I'm being tracked by the Batwave transponder.

138
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,765
Not for long.

139
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,771
Priority one, Batwave override.

140
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,784
Power down.

141
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,764
Batman.

142
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,793
Stop you.

143
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,798
Poison you.

144
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,803
Stop you.

145
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,831
Poison you.

146
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,815
'Destroy.'

147
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,816
Priority one, Batwave override.

148
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,831
Autopilot, engage.

149
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:55,854
Argh!

150
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,853
Batgirl, Robin not sure you can understand me

151
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:27,871
but this will help you.

152
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,158
<i>Alfred's cure will have to wait.</i>

153
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,877
<i>With Batgirl and Robin infected</i>

154
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,893
<i>returning to the mansion and the cave is too risky.</i>

155
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:48,891
<i>Fortunately, I have other resources.</i>

156
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,899
<i>A home away from home.</i>

157
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,922
Built in case Bruce Wayne and the Batman

158
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,903
ever needed to go off the grid.

159
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>Only 17 hours left.</i>

160
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,916
<i>Strange's antidote is concentrated.</i>

161
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,919
<i>To get it to work over a large area</i>

162
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,947
<i>the antidote must be vaporized.</i>

163
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:32,955
<i>Thermo charges.</i>

164
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:39,947
<i>A lot of 'em, wired to pick up the Batwave signal.</i>

165
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:42,950
<i>Everything is ready.</i>

166
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:39,990
"Bruce Wayne, Gotham's White Knight."

167
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:42,001
We'll see.

168
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:45,999
All that's left is to transmit the signal.

169
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:49,011
For that, I'll need to get to higher ground.

170
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,041
I have one chance to save this city.

171
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,029
No!

172
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,075
Clank.

173
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:43,078
Grab. Hold.

174
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,093
- Hurt you. - Mess ahead.

175
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,078
Mess ahead!

176
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,102
Whoosh.

177
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,099
Mess ahead.

178
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,114
<i>Strange may be a madman</i>

179
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:42,110
<i>but he's also a brilliant psychiatrist.</i>

180
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:44,130
He'll mess with your head.

181
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:51,109
<i>Robin and I were hit with Strange's antidote.</i>

182
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,122
<i>Moments later we were attacked.</i>

183
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,125
<i>The air was safe to breathe.</i>

184
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,121
The chemical analysis shows nothing weird.

185
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:01,122
<i>There was no trace of toxin in Gordon's hair.</i>

186
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:03,138
<i>Strange virtually sent me to the police station</i>

187
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:06,142
<i>as if he wanted me to get the antidote.</i>

188
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,153
<i>But why?</i>

189
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:12,131
What if..

190
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,152
What if this isn't the antidote?

191
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:16,166
What if this is the toxin?

192
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:23,162
Boom Arkham. Batman.

193
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:52,191
If this is a mistake, it's my last.

194
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:05,225
No more. Mess ahead.

195
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:22,234
- You okay? - That depends.

196
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:27,228
Were you a zombie ten seconds ago?

197
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,214
You were under Strange's influence

198
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,227
the moment he spilled that vial and infected us.

199
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:35,233
'That's why he was moved upstairs to maximum security.'

200
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,228
Then there were no traces of the toxin

201
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,221
in anything we tested.

202
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:42,231
'Because there was no toxin there.'

203
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:44,223
And when I captured Robin

204
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,238
doctors were able to take a sample

205
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:47,238
of the real toxin from his tissues

206
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:49,230
and quickly synthesize an antidote.

207
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:51,230
Two more seconds, and you would've delivered.

208
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:54,232
Strange's real toxin to the crowd.

209
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:56,240
For future reference, there are easier ways

210
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:58,268
to duck out of giving a speech.

211
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,260
I was this close to hurting all the people

212
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,258
I try to protect, Alfred.

213
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,256
What if I'm not as lucky next time?

214
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,252
If you'll forgive my saying so

215
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:15,253
luck had nothing to do with it.

216
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:16,271
Even under a madman's influence

217
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:19,256
and believing himself to be alone

218
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,268
the Batman fought his way to the truth.

219
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:25,268
That's who he is. It's who you are.

220
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:30,310
'And now Gotham's very own white knight, Mr. Bruce Wayne.
