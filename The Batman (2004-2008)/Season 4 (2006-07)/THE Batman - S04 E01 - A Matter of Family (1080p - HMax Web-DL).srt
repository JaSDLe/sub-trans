1
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:10,999
'I think it's time for practice.'

2
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:14,033
That must mean you've finished everything on your plate, Dick.

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,037
Chomp chomp.

4
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,042
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

5
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:30,049
Whoo-hoo!

6
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:37,059
I'm telling you, Mary, a leash is the only answer for that boy.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,055
Wait for us, son.

8
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,045
Dick, your father said to wait.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,066
Looks like the circus is in town.

10
00:00:57,072 --> 00:01:00,074
Tony Zucco. Welcome to Gotham City.

11
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,062
John Grayson, the circus manager.

12
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:09,050
Can I help you?

13
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:12,055
I'd like to think I'm here to help <i>you, John.</i>

14
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,071
For a small fee my brothers and I

15
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:20,081
'we'll provide your circus with protection.'

16
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,077
Protection?

17
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,068
I'm not sure I understand why

18
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:28,067
we would need your protection.

19
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:29,097
Hmm.

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,084
I come from circus folk myself

21
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:36,080
so let me put this in terms you can understand.

22
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:38,085
You don't pay us, and you'll have to

23
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,121
deal with the strongman..

24
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:48,130
'...a lion tamer..'

25
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:55,130
thud '...and a juggler.'

26
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,131
bam bam

27
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,141
thud.

28
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:07,109
Stop!

29
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,134
Dick!

30
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:14,121
You've got quite a family here, John.

31
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:16,124
My pop's always said

32
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:19,123
family is the most important thing.

33
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:22,128
'I know my brothers mean the world to me.'

34
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm not sure what I'd do if something happened to them.

35
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,204
Beep

36
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:16,213
boom

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,214
whoosh.

38
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,220
- Unh! - Let me be blunt, John.

39
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,233
I don't think this circus

40
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:58,226
or your family can afford

41
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,224
not having our protection.

42
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:03,234
Funny, because I think we can.

43
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:08,239
And what makes you so sure about that, sonny?

44
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:11,252
I called the police five minutes ago.

45
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,276
And guess who intercepted that call.

46
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:22,263
Aah! Ooh! Uhh!

47
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,273
Huh?

48
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:34,288
Come on! We got to go.

49
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,291
Swish.

50
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,295
Our family has been divided.

51
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,317
I think we should return the favor.

52
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:44,324
Chomp chomp Okay, Dick, come on out now.

53
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:47,339
'No. I look like a loser.'

54
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:50,349
Your mother put a lot of work into the new costumes.

55
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:53,376
'Well, are you gonna just stand there?'

56
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,357
Ah! Uh! Aah!

57
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:03,378
Is there a reason why this costume has to be so colorful?

58
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,359
Because when I see you up there, Richard

59
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,371
'you make me think of a little robin.'

60
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,362
Uh! A robin, like the bird.

61
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:18,364
You know, kids my age get beat up for nicknames like that.

62
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:23,364
How about if we call you our flying squirrel? Better?

63
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:26,383
You know, dad, I'm not the only one who looks like a loser.

64
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,400
Loser? I'll teach you!

65
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,407
- Oh, John. - Ha-ha.

66
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,391
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls

67
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,398
'children of all ages'

68
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:42,388
I present to you

69
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:45,403
the fearless Flying Graysons..

70
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:49,390
'...as always, performing their daring feats'

71
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,433
'without the safety of a net.'

72
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,431
Aren't they fantastic?

73
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,446
Clang.

74
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,458
'And now the youngest member'

75
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:46,469
'of this amazing family.'

76
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:04,484
ting ting Huh?

77
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,471
Dick!

78
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,501
No!

79
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,494
I think the Flying Graysons

80
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:18,510
might have to change their name.

81
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:51,509
Hello, Dick. I'm Bruce Wayne.

82
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,519
I'm sorry about your loss.

83
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:56,533
Thanks, Mr. Wayne, for everything.

84
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:58,551
I heard you paid for all this.

85
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:02,538
So how are you holding up?

86
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,533
I'll be okay

87
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:07,552
at least that's what everyone's been telling me.

88
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:16,578
I miss them.

89
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,579
It's just not fair.

90
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,585
'Anyway, thanks again.'

91
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:47,569
His parents were all the family that boy had.

92
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,583
That's why I've decided to take him in

93
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,607
as a foster son, if he'll have me.

94
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:54,808
I was lucky enough to have you

95
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,605
to guide me through those dark days, Alfred.

96
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:02,602
'Dick deserves the same.'

97
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:10,630
Welcome home, Dick.

98
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:21,619
Dinner is served.

99
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,617
I think this table might be bigger

100
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,619
than my family's entire trailer.

101
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:29,620
Indeed. It can seat 22 and sleep half that number.

102
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:32,652
Now, be sure you finish everything on your plate.

103
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:36,643
So where's Bruce?

104
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:38,660
He's never around, is he?

105
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,655
Unfortunately, his work demands much of his time.

106
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:49,628
Master Dick has been asking for you.

107
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:50,646
I can't sit back and wait for the police

108
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,643
to link the Zuccos to the crime.

109
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,633
Now that the boy is part of this family

110
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,648
I suspect he may need a father figure

111
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,655
more than he needs a crime fighter.

112
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,640
The criminal responsible for my parents death

113
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,644
was never brought to justice, Alfred.

114
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:07,663
That's a burden I won't let Dick carry.

115
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:10,649
Boss Zucco and his brothers have been harassing

116
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,656
Gotham business owners for years.

117
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,672
'So far, my only lead is a toothpick I found at the circus'

118
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:17,656
'carrying traces of Zucco's DNA.'

119
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,668
'That would seem to confirm what you already know'

120
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:21,677
'his involvement.'

121
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,677
This specific brand of toothpick is carried

122
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:26,694
in only two places in Gotham, Alfred.

123
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,670
Garrett's Family Restaurant

124
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:33,703
and the Ice Pick Club.

125
00:11:58,726 --> 00:11:59,732
Password.

126
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,752
Tony Zucco..

127
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,740
Where is he?

128
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:21,742
You got a lot of guts coming onto our turf like this.

129
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:35,757
Ugh!

130
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,778
'Come on! Let's get out of here. Uh!'

131
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,767
- Where is Zucco? - I don't know.

132
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,763
He's laying low, but his brothers

133
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,760
they're still shaking down parts of Old Gotham.

134
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:56,766
You'll find him there.

135
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,764
Tell Zucco I'm coming.

136
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:01,781
Tell him I'm coming for all of them.

137
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,793
Master Dick, could I see you? Chop, chop.

138
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,800
Huh?

139
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,832
'I thought you might want to see this.'

140
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:41,808
One day, Alfred, Zucco's gonna have to pay for what he did.

141
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:43,836
I'm gonna make sure of that.

142
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,823
We should prepare for dinner.

143
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:52,810
Perhaps Master Bruce will even join us this evening.

144
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,855
And perhaps monkeys will fly out of my butt.

145
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:09,865
Chomp chomp.

146
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,858
And, uh, give me one of those.

147
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,850
Hmm? Huh!

148
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:19,879
Crash

149
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:22,885
swish

150
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,874
pow

151
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:35,897
splat - Huh? - I want answers.

152
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,872
Where is Zucco?

153
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,882
No way I rat out family.

154
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,892
You already have.

155
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:48,910
Pow

156
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:16,939
clack

157
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,942
click clack.

158
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:43,959
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

159
00:15:58,961 --> 00:15:59,977
Batman.

160
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:07,978
Uh-oh.

161
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,002
You're..

162
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:41,997
'Under the circumstances'

163
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,982
it was only a matter of time

164
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,986
before you learned my secret.

165
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,030
Okay, let's talk about what you saw.

166
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:49,997
You're the Batman, the Dark Knight

167
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:51,262
the world's greatest detective!

168
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,998
That's you!

169
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:54,006
And it's in large part

170
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,038
why you haven't seen a lot of me lately.

171
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,179
I don't want your childhood to be consumed by revenge..

172
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,042
Like mine was.

173
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,032
You're going after Zucco, aren't you?

174
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:13,031
No. That's for me.

175
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:16,044
I wanna make sure he gets what's coming to him.

176
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,018
Maybe we should finish this in the morning.

177
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,048
It's late.

178
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,026
Late for Bruce Wayne

179
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,054
'early for the Batman.'

180
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:35,040
Zucco..

181
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:37,064
I know you're here.

182
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,073
Boom.

183
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:49,084
If I find Batman, I find Zucco.

184
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,067
The circus.

185
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:01,101
But I can't go dressed like this.

186
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,114
Mornin', sunshine.

187
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:22,090
You know, being here has really brought back memories.

188
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,125
Believe it or not

189
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,129
once upon a time my pops and I were in the circus.

190
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,097
We were knife throwers.

191
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:31,104
'Well, I threw the knives'

192
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:34,113
and dad hoped I wouldn't hit him.

193
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,125
It was quite an act, really.

194
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:41,110
Zing.

195
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:43,119
We put him on a board just like the one you're on

196
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:46,113
and I'd say, "Ladies and gentlemen

197
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:48,110
"please don't try this at home.

198
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,142
I'm a trained professional."

199
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:53,118
'Then my dad would say'

200
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,121
'"I knew we should have given you'

201
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,126
piano lessons instead."

202
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,128
Ha-ha.

203
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:01,129
Always good for a laugh.

204
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:03,127
Zing ching ching ching.

205
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,143
Why'd you give up such a promising career?

206
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:09,154
Well, one day, I missed.

207
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:14,159
Swish clang.

208
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:16,170
Huh?

209
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:26,156
'So Batman's got family, too.'

210
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,189
Cute.

211
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:52,200
Didn't you parents ever teach you any manners?

212
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:14,216
Creak.

213
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:19,208
I watched you take down my brother, Batman.

214
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:22,228
Now it's your turn to watch.

215
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,249
Huh?

216
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:55,242
Huh? No.

217
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,253
A-a-aah!

218
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:58,266
Zucco!

219
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,266
Huh?

220
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
Ohh!

221
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:26,263
Nice save.

222
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:29,271
But I thought you wanted Zucco to get what was coming to him.

223
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:31,275
Well, he did, didn't he?

224
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:32,310
Justice.

225
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,287
I've been thinking, Dick.

226
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,284
I'm not sure Bruce Wayne has what it takes

227
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:39,297
to raise you properly.

228
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:42,288
Yeah, I kind of noticed he's never around.

229
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:46,307
But if not Bruce Wayne, what about the Batman?

230
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,311
We'd have to give you a name.

231
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,305
How about Robin?

232
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,297
Like the bird?

233
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,341
It's a family name.
