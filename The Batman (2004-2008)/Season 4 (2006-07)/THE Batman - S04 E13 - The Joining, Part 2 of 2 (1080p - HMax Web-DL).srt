1
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:12,082
No.

2
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:25,075
- What do we do? - We fight!

3
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,080
Unfortunately, Batman, this is not a fight

4
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:30,109
anyone, any planet has ever survived.

5
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:38,080
- Don't they look angry? - Not they, it.

6
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:41,087
The Joining has many bodies, but only one mind

7
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,090
a mind focused on harvesting your planet's technology

8
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:47,111
<i>and destroying what's left.</i>

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,098
Now might be a good time for you to float us out of here.

10
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,112
Not with them up there.

11
00:01:57,136 --> 00:02:01,116
Well, if you can't go up you go down.

12
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,142
Boom.

13
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,142
Oh, my!

14
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:20,118
There's an emergency exit tunnel right behind this wall.

15
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,158
Well, I'd say this qualifies as an emergency.

16
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:27,166
Screech.

17
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:33,153
'Go, I'll deal with them.'

18
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,153
'It's not that Batman doesn't want our help'

19
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:55,173
it's just that he doesn't need our help.

20
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,161
- Big difference. - Great.

21
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,163
So you're saying that to the big guy

22
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,202
we're basically useless.

23
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,174
I wouldn't go that far.

24
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:05,174
We proved Alfred's not a robot.

25
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:07,202
And I'm so relieved.

26
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,181
Lucius, you're hurt!

27
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,177
You know what to do, Alfred.

28
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:17,180
What's going on?

29
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:19,194
Alien invasion.

30
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:21,221
Alien invasion, huh?

31
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,205
Excuse me.

32
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,202
- Alien invasion? - Aliens?

33
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,225
What happened to robots?

34
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:36,197
A-ah! Alien! Got an alien here!

35
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,234
- Different kind of alien. - Hi. John Jones.

36
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:42,204
Huh..

37
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:45,217
How are you so calm, Alfred? Aliens!

38
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:47,214
I think that would warrant at least

39
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:49,212
one of your signature cocked eyebrows.

40
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,219
I keep house for a man who dresses like a bat

41
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,256
and works in a cave, at this point in my life

42
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,216
there's little that phases me.

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,246
Uh... what's that?

44
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:02,239
Robothead. So five minutes ago.

45
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:05,261
No. It can't be.

46
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,262
More than your city is in danger now, Batman.

47
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:31,293
- This is about Earth. - It's the end of the world.

48
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,296
It can't be. It just looks a whole lot like it.

49
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,266
We can stop it, right?

50
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,288
If I may, sir... how?

51
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,283
Shut it off. Please.

52
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:06,303
I'm sorry, Batman. I had hoped to prevent this.

53
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:09,289
I'm not ready to give up just yet.

54
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:13,292
The saucer, it's our one physical link to The Joining.

55
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,313
Earlier analysis revealed it was made up

56
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:16,311
of a bonded metallic hybrid.

57
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:20,305
Different metals bonded together to form a single alloy.

58
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,320
Like The Joining itself

59
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,322
many elements, one purpose.

60
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,309
They created a metal stronger

61
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,314
'than almost any compound on Earth'

62
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:31,318
'but they used Wayne Industries' technology to do it.'

63
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:34,357
- Ah, then that would mean... - Exactly!

64
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,331
The Joining's just made their first mistake.

65
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:41,321
We do not make mistakes. We are The Joining.

66
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,334
- Unplug it. - It is unplugged.

67
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,343
I am drawing power from The Joining.

68
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:49,338
We have taken your technology, we have improved it.

69
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,330
We use it now to destroy your world.

70
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:54,358
We are unstoppable.

71
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,341
For such a good-looking guy

72
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,381
he talks too much.

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,375
We have work to do now. Gotham is depending on us.

74
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,360
Gotham City has literally been overrun by..

75
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,384
- Aah! - Oh, come on. Come on.

76
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:26,393
On my command! Fire!

77
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,401
Commissioner, what else can we do?

78
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:50,421
I've already done the best thing I can think of.

79
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,395
'Time to test it.'

80
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,401
Robin, go for a ride.

81
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,411
'Take it up, but not too high.'

82
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,435
Why not?

83
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,435
Whoa!

84
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,409
Molecular instability.

85
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:12,431
- Impressive. - And funny.

86
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:16,416
Bruce made sure I built a fail-safe into all our tech

87
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,417
just in case it ever fell into the wrong hands.

88
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,420
I get it, like a shut-off switch.

89
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,424
And by the way.. Ow!

90
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:26,439
And since The Joining used our technology

91
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,426
to build their fleet..

92
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,431
We can use it to take their fleet apart.

93
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,438
Looks like they came halfway across the galaxy

94
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:33,703
just to get their butts kicked.

95
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,442
We still have one problem.

96
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,451
A signal strong enough to affect all the ships

97
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,457
would have to be sent from a satellite relay.

98
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,460
Which means we need to send the signal

99
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:44,447
from inside Wayne Industries.

100
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,461
This wouldn't be the same Wayne Industries

101
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:48,454
that's guarded by giant robots.

102
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,454
- Would it? - We're going with you.

103
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,467
I know the Wayne Industries' layout better than anyone.

104
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:55,495
A group is only gonna slow me down.

105
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:06,478
'You have to learn to trust your partners, Batman.'

106
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,483
And no, this isn't your conscience speaking.

107
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,472
Haven't you been watching The Joining?

108
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,479
They're linked, coordinated, strong.

109
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:16,479
If we wanna beat them, we have to be like them.

110
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,481
- No way I can shake you? - Not on Earth.

111
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:21,490
Then do me one favor.

112
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,513
Fasten the belt.

113
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,505
- Planning repairs, are we? - No point.

114
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,505
End of the world, remember?

115
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,505
Besides, you heard Batman.

116
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,515
We'd only get in the way.

117
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,504
There are times when I, too, disagree

118
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,508
with Master Bruce's decisions.

119
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:44,522
And when that happens, there's something I do

120
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:47,540
that never fails to lift my spirits.

121
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,533
I disobey him.

122
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:57,545
I think I saw a welding torch around here.

123
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:05,537
You ready?

124
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,538
Not even Martians live forever.

125
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:10,570
You go around the south side. I'll take the north entrance.

126
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:30,553
Strangely beautiful, isn't it?

127
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,570
I found a phonograph record that seems fitting.

128
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:35,598
Good choice, Wagner would have been too...

129
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,578
And I found this.

130
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,573
I'd forgotten this.

131
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:44,573
We took him to the air show.

132
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,569
A long time ago.

133
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,570
I think that was the first day

134
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:50,611
where he forgot, just a little.

135
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,581
I just counseled two young people

136
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:02,580
to disobey orders to help if they could.

137
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:04,591
Perhaps, we should take the same advice.

138
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:06,596
I don't think I'm up for any fisticuffs.

139
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,602
There are other skills.

140
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:10,599
It's probably useless, you know?

141
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:12,633
Oh, absolutely.

142
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:26,607
Forgive my inhospitality

143
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:29,648
but terrorizing Gotham is my job!

144
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:46,644
Screech.

145
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:49,628
Commish, it's Freeze. What do we do with him?

146
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,651
We back him up!

147
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,683
This town's gone mad!

148
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:34,689
Yes!

149
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:37,720
No time to celebrate. We need to get to Wayne Industries.

150
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:42,776
Broadcast ready. Activate now.

151
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,787
"Signal blocked?" No!

152
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:01,778
We can tap into the Wayne Industries'

153
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:03,769
security camera system

154
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:05,780
be another set of eyes for Bruce.

155
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,786
Humans... defiant

156
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,768
even in the face of certain defeat.

157
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,782
Certain defeat? We shall see about that.

158
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,786
If you're referring to the fail-safe signal

159
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,776
you hope to transmit

160
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,798
then know your friend was unsuccessful.

161
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,784
'The Joining has blocked it.'

162
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:22,800
'Like everything else on this planet'

163
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:26,815
'The Joining now controls the satellite feeds.'

164
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:29,808
The signal's being blocked, Alfred.

165
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:31,805
'Lucius believes he can hack into the system'

166
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,810
'and override The Joining's control'

167
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,813
'but you will need to manually override it'

168
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,800
'from your end, as well.'

169
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:38,813
That's going to take time.

170
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:40,808
I'm not sure I can override the system

171
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:42,801
and keep these guys at bay.

172
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,807
Then it sounds like someone needs backup.

173
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,811
I told you two not to come here!

174
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,820
That's why we had to quit as your partners.

175
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:51,814
Yeah, that's right. We quit.

176
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,814
You can't order us around anymore.

177
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:56,838
We're freelancers and can be wherever we wanna be.

178
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,821
I hear there's work in Metropolis.

179
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,826
You picked us, Batman, because you knew we were strong.

180
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,840
'And sometimes that's about'

181
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,834
'being strong enough to help you.'

182
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,869
'Even when you think you don't need us.'

183
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,835
It's never been about not needing you.

184
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,869
It's about not losing you.

185
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,886
It was a long way around from the south entrance.

186
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,866
Am I interrupting something?

187
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,864
No, I was just..

188
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,894
Consulting with my team.

189
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:46,879
If I don't get this done

190
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,885
this will be a very dangerous place.

191
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:50,913
We'll secure the room, Batman.

192
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,898
You just get that signal ready.

193
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:49,932
They seem to be rising above the center of each major city

194
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,929
and forming into giant rings.

195
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,934
The Joining has what it came for.

196
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:54,948
Now it is time for the end.

197
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:58,955
Within minutes, your world will be destroyed.

198
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,958
'Sir, we have a new problem.'

199
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,958
'The alien ships are forming into superweapons'

200
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,954
'and I fear, we haven't much time before they activate.'

201
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,980
Just keep working, Alfred.

202
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,004
'We're ready on our end, sir.'

203
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:50,029
Let's do it.

204
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,045
'Bruce's signal is spreading across the planet.'

205
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,047
It's looking good.

206
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,050
This has never happened before.

207
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,088
It worked! Yes!

208
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,047
We did it!

209
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:52,056
How unusual.

210
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,085
'Humans.'

211
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,093
thud.

212
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,127
What, Martians don't knock?

213
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,116
How are things, Bruce?

214
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,126
Good. Gotham's rebuilding.

215
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,136
Not just Gotham, the entire world

216
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,123
rebuilds towards a new tomorrow

217
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:05,135
a tomorrow that would never have come

218
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,127
if not for one man who wanted to make a difference.

219
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,148
'You saved your planet, Bruce.'

220
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:13,141
I didn't. We did.

221
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:16,150
In the end, you did work well with partners.

222
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:19,149
Perhaps you would be open to expanding your circle.

223
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:23,141
Sorry, John, I already have two partners, don't need a third.

224
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:27,171
Well, actually we were hoping you would join us.

225
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,189
Let me show you.

226
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:49,185
I found others..

227
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,207
Like me, like you.

228
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,199
'The world's changing, Batman.'

229
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:04,189
'You can go it alone if you want'

230
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,184
or step into the larger world

231
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,229
and be a part of the greater good.

232
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,339
I've been monitoring your construction here for months

233
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,239
'hacking your systems since they came online.'

234
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:25,204
I wondered, John, when you were gonna tell me

235
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:27,232
about your space station.

236
00:20:46,264 --> 00:20:49,271
You've put together quite a league.

237
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,272
Let's get to work.
