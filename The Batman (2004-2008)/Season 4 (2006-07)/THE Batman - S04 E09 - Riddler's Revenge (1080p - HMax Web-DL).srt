1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,035
I'll give you one last chance, old friend.

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,005
'It can be cracked. It can be made.'

3
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,011
It can be told. It can be played.

4
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,027
What is it?

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,051
Come on, Gorman, it's easy.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,010
A joke.

7
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:32,025
- Jump? - A joke!

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,013
- Jam? - A joke.

9
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:38,060
Jarlsburg? No, sorry.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,053
Beep beep.

11
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:46,027
Looks like you'll get the consolation prize.

12
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,066
A joke, Riddler. That's the answer.

13
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,048
It's also what you are.

14
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:56,056
Swish swish - Uh! - Oh, no, no, no.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,091
'Not so fast.'

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,056
I've waited too long for you

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,088
to get away now, Gorman.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,078
This was personal, Batman.

19
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,092
Whirr.

20
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,083
Hate doing this to my own ship, Eddie.

21
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,089
But if that means having you out of my life

22
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:44,104
once and for all.

23
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,127
Beep beep.

24
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,202
'You know, since this is cooking class'

25
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,212
maybe you should've made something you can eat.

26
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,217
You can eat this.

27
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,217
It's a combination

28
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:42,245
of my two favorite things

29
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,236
soup and licorice.

30
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,260
Mr. Burke, I-I'm not feeling so well.

31
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,229
Would you like to go home, Mr. Grayson?

32
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:04,228
Yes... please.

33
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,293
Well, you're not going to.

34
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,232
You've been sliding out of here

35
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,243
with barely believable excuses for months.

36
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:13,239
'Plant allergies, frostbite, hallucinations.'

37
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:15,240
'All those toothaches.'

38
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,255
You have any teeth left, by the way?

39
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,268
A couple.

40
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:36,273
Destroying Gorman was a pet project of mine.

41
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:39,273
Now ask me how angry I am.

42
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:41,277
That was us hitting the bottom of Gotham Bay

43
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:44,266
which means we're too deep to make radio contact.

44
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,264
'The pressure's too strong to swim out'

45
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,270
and we have a very limited air supply.

46
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,288
I suggest we put this on hold.

47
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:53,289
Ooh, sounds like we're in quite the pickle.

48
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:56,288
Then here's an easy one for you.

49
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,313
What do I have to lose?

50
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:06,308
Is that the answer you were looking for?

51
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,291
Gotta get out of here.

52
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:15,305
Well, you said be creative.

53
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:19,298
Yes, but we're not making rat poison, are we?

54
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:20,318
You get an F for the assignment

55
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:23,312
but an A for what were you thinking.

56
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,318
Wait, you can't give him an F without tasting it.

57
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:29,329
You want to try it, Mr. Grayson?

58
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,338
I sure do.

59
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,334
It burns.

60
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,340
Oh, I see, Mr. Grayson.

61
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:46,361
'Nice try, but you're not going..'

62
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:00,354
How about you take the rest of the day off, Mr. Grayson?

63
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:02,380
Too much cheddar, huh?

64
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:08,360
What is 9857?

65
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,366
There's nothing in here that's gonna help us.

66
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,367
We're trapped.

67
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,351
It's how many seconds

68
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,385
before we run out of air.

69
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,370
Okay, try this one on precise.

70
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:22,371
What's at the beginning that's also at the end?

71
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,377
Don't you ever get tired of riddles?

72
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:27,366
Oh, but you'll like this one.

73
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,380
What's at the beginning that's also at the end?

74
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,409
'The answer is Gorman.'

75
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:36,386
And you, Batman.

76
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,395
At the beginning and now the end of my career as the riddler.

77
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,394
Both of you were two pieces in a jigsaw puzzle

78
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,406
that began forming long ago.

79
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,396
<i>You see, I was always interested</i>

80
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,432
<i>in matters of the mind</i>

81
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,412
<i>even if my dimwitted daddy couldn't understand.</i>

82
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:56,405
How about we try a real game for once

83
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,422
and play some ball, champ?

84
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,420
<i>And the thrill that came from unriddling a riddle</i>

85
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:06,408
<i>continued to grow</i>

86
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:09,410
<i>especially when I began upping the ante.</i>

87
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,429
<i>Games, you see, were much more interesting</i>

88
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:14,423
<i>when you were playing for something real.</i>

89
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,419
<i>Yet I needed still bigger challenges</i>

90
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,421
<i>which is how I of all people</i>

91
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:22,445
<i>ended up in a Gotham university lab.</i>

92
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,467
You're a genius, Edward.

93
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,429
External bio hard drives for the human brain.

94
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,448
This invention is going to put us on the map.

95
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,434
More than that, Julie.

96
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,433
We're changing the way people think.

97
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:35,453
Can't remember a phone number?

98
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,439
Boom! More memory.

99
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:39,447
Trouble with some nasty math equation?

100
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:42,449
Boom! More processing power.

101
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,471
What's this?

102
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:48,451
You have to be careful who you give these puzzles to.

103
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,464
They could drive someone crazy.

104
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:53,481
Here. It's easy.

105
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:58,473
You're incredible.

106
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,464
Not so bad yourself.

107
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,477
Ahem. Knock, knock.

108
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:05,484
I'm back. Ha ha ha.

109
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:09,467
Gorman, what part of we're not interested

110
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:10,484
didn't you understand?

111
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:11,589
Well, maybe I'm not someone

112
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,486
who's gonna take no for an answer, Eddie.

113
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,519
'Look, with my business savvy and your invention'

114
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,497
'we can make a whole lot of money together.'

115
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,490
Maybe we should at least listen to what he has to offer.

116
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:25,489
The brains of the operation, huh?

117
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,528
Now what's it gonna take for you to play ball, champ?

118
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,502
I was never one for ball, champ

119
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:37,513
and I don't plan on having some small-minded dolt

120
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:39,502
profiting off my genius!

121
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:40,510
Grunt.

122
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:43,526
You're wrestling with the wrong gator, Eddie.

123
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:46,504
What were you thinking, Edward?

124
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,849
Someone like Gorman could help us.

125
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,552
I don't know why you act the way you do sometimes.

126
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,530
<i>I hated upsetting Julie</i>

127
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,518
<i>so I told her about my father</i>

128
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,535
<i>and all the other Neanderthals like Gorman</i>

129
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,530
<i>determined to get in my way.</i>

130
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:03,560
<i>And suddenly, I wasn't such a riddle to her anymore.</i>

131
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:09,538
<i>Soon we were ready to demonstrate our invention</i>

132
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:13,534
<i>for the president of the university, no less.</i>

133
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:15,554
Edward, I'd like you to meet a potential investor

134
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,553
and the man kind enough to let us use his home

135
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:21,542
for today's display, Chuck Gorman.

136
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,566
Pleased to meet you, Eddie.

137
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,567
Let's just get started.

138
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,560
"The Laws Of Physics." Read it.

139
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:40,594
- Which part? - The whole thing.

140
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:02,586
Now what is the law of universal gravitation?

141
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,601
Uh, umm..

142
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,597
It states that a particle attracts every other particle

143
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,606
with a force that is directly proportional to the product

144
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,601
of their masses and inversely proportional to the square

145
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,635
of the distance between them.

146
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,637
'Call an ambulance.'

147
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:31,630
Uh..

148
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:34,617
What have you done to him?

149
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,618
<i>While the blame would fall on me</i>

150
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:38,621
<i>I was smart enough to know it was Gorman</i>

151
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,627
<i>who sabotaged that disc.</i>

152
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,621
<i>With me out of the picture</i>

153
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:45,657
<i>he would now easily get his hands on my technology.</i>

154
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,643
I was ruined.

155
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,634
And in that one moment, I..

156
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,646
Lost my last chance to..

157
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,644
To what?

158
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,681
To not be the Riddler.

159
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,662
Come on. Where are you, Batman?

160
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,694
The distress signal came from somewhere out here.

161
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,704
I still don't see how I fit into this.

162
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,663
Oh, we're getting there.

163
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,666
You see, after the university let me go

164
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,706
I decided to go into interior decorating.

165
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,718
How in the world?

166
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,736
- What? - 'Exactly.'

167
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,723
What, my favorite word.

168
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,737
Eddie, is that you?

169
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:22,735
What have you done to my house?

170
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,767
Oh, I took the liberty to make some improvements

171
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,733
while you were out.

172
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,746
'And because you had some fun at my expense'

173
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,752
'I thought I'd return the favor.'

174
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,751
I had nothing to do with what happened to you.

175
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,749
Of course, you didn't.

176
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:49,751
Now, let's have some fun.

177
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,756
Question, what 11-letter word

178
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,765
does everyone pronounce incorrectly?

179
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:57,765
I'm not playing your sick games, Eddie.

180
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:00,768
My father hated my games too.

181
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:01,775
But I think he just lacked

182
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,803
the proper motivation to play them.

183
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:09,783
Okay, okay.

184
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:10,788
Eleven letter word everyone

185
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:13,784
pronounces incorrectly.

186
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:16,788
Incorrectly. The answer's incorrectly.

187
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:20,791
'Very good, Gormie. That's the spirit.'

188
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,802
Whoa!

189
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:26,829
Time for our next riddle.

190
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,807
Forwards, it is heavy.

191
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:31,825
Backwards, it is not.

192
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:36,821
Forwards, it is heavy. Backwards, it is not.

193
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,808
I don't know.

194
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,814
'I'll give you a hint.'

195
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,824
Backwards, it is not.

196
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,829
N-O-T.

197
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,831
Oh, do we need yet another hint?

198
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:57,815
Ton. A ton. T-O-N.

199
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,861
Sorry! Too late.

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,859
Goodbye, Gormie.

201
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,851
What?

202
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:12,850
Oh, great, another freak.

203
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:14,846
Who are you supposed to be?

204
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,843
I know the answer to that.

205
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,881
The Batman. I've heard of you.

206
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,843
- A regular do-gooder. - And who are you?

207
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:26,847
Nothing more than a bit of a gamesman.

208
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:28,863
A riddler, if you will.

209
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,848
'Good thing you arrived.'

210
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,886
'Gormie needs all the help he can get.'

211
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,883
"Within the mirror you must strive

212
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,912
'"to find a way to stay alive.'

213
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,892
'What is four plus number five?"'

214
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,882
It's nine. The answer is nine.

215
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,898
With a riddle, the most obvious answer is rarely the right one.

216
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,910
Wait.

217
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:14,918
See? I told you.

218
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:19,904
You've just accelerated the countdown.

219
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,899
The riddle says find a way.

220
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:22,909
A way is a direction.

221
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:23,921
A direction is south.

222
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:26,904
'Four plus number five is an inverted image'

223
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:27,946
'of the word south.'

224
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:35,948
Argh!

225
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,931
No! That's cheating, Batman.

226
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:50,928
Maybe if this were a game. You're done.

227
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,947
Actually this has been so much fun.

228
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:55,956
I think I'm just beginning.

229
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,946
<i>You inspired me that night.</i>

230
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,952
<i>I needed toys like yours.</i>

231
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:04,951
<i>Maybe a little fashion sense too.</i>

232
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:08,952
And I let Gorman taste some real success

233
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:10,969
so he'd have that much more to lose.

234
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:15,960
That ship was filled with his, my bio-sensitive discs.

235
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:18,971
Now, they're at the bottom of the bay.

236
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:20,989
But so are we.

237
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:40,007
As I said, you were there at the beginning.

238
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,997
And now, you're here

239
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:46,984
at the very bitter end.

240
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:47,999
It's not over yet.

241
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,007
This container's filled with air

242
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,001
which is lighter than water.

243
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:54,998
Then we're not floating because something's pinning us down.

244
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:58,006
Those jolts, they were caused by the debris shifting.

245
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,015
If we can move the debris from the inside

246
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,041
we might break loose.

247
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:06,073
Maybe if both of us tried.

248
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,050
You and me? Work together?

249
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,034
I'm into riddles, not jokes.

250
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,015
Besides, I've ruined Gorman

251
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,034
and that's as good a note as any to go out on.

252
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:21,018
Then you're sure it was Gorman who sabotaged you?

253
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,032
Even you, Batman, could've puzzled together

254
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:26,031
a mystery this obvious.

255
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:27,041
Yeah, obvious.

256
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:29,033
I guess I just figured with a riddle.

257
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:32,051
The most obvious answer's rarely the right one.

258
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,089
Sizzle.

259
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:14,116
- Come on. - So you can take me to prison?

260
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,416
Better than where you were headed.

261
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:21,117
Robin?

262
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:33,122
No more question marks, Batman.

263
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,103
Now we put a period

264
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:38,117
at the end of your life.

265
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:42,126
Exclamation point, anyone?

266
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,146
Vroom

267
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:57,144
sizzle.

268
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:05,127
Another late night in the lab, Julie?

269
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:09,127
- Ed-Edward. - Whoa, you remember me.

270
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,141
I'm touched.

271
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:12,147
What are you doing here?

272
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:15,141
There's a riddle I'm having trouble solving.

273
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,143
You were always so good at them.

274
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,158
Maybe you can help.

275
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:22,183
The $64,000 question.

276
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,154
Why did I sabotage our project?

277
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:29,179
Come on, Edward. It's not that hard.

278
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:32,166
I thought you understood me.

279
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,172
I understood you were a psychopath.

280
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:38,162
One that was going to ruin any chance for success.

281
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:40,176
And so you got rid of me.

282
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,171
Very smart.

283
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:45,193
But I think we can make you smarter yet.

284
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:51,182
Our little external bio hard drives for the brain

285
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:54,173
were only intended to be used one at a time.

286
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:57,192
Let's see what happens when we use them all together.

287
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:00,216
No, Edward. What are you doing?

288
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,184
- Aah! - I know, I know.

289
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,202
He's about to get his butt kicked.

290
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,210
Am I right?

291
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:18,207
So tell me, Batman

292
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:22,206
how'd you piece together it was my Julie who betrayed me?

293
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,210
Easy. Gorman was a businessman, not a scientist.

294
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:28,222
He would never have known how to sabotage that disc.

295
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:31,246
And that just left one other person.

296
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:38,219
Anyone would've realized that except you, champ.

297
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,239
Grr.

298
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:51,228
No question about it, Batman.

299
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,262
This time I will have my revenge.

300
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:55,276
No!

301
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,271
'Aah!'

302
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,291
Let the police set her free.

303
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:28,277
One last riddle, Robin.

304
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:32,296
When is a villain not the villain?

305
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:50,313
They're all yours, officers.
