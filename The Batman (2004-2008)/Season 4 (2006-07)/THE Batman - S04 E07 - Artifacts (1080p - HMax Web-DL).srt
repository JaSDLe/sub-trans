1
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:15,997
We're through. We found it.

2
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,040
We found a cave, Moira, not necessarily the cave.

3
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,038
This is it. You know it is.

4
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,054
Beep.

5
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,056
We found the Batcave.

6
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:51,040
Archeological log, Gray reporting.

7
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,050
We seem to have found definitive proof

8
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:56,079
that ancient Gotham's legendary Batman

9
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,044
long thought to be a myth, actually existed.

10
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:02,057
The time is exactly 1900 hours.

11
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:06,080
The date is August 8th, 3027.

12
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:34,113
Vroom

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,121
ka-ching

14
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:53,116
vroom.

15
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:23,135
Remember, don't disturb any artifacts

16
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,143
until your recorder's taken a complete 3-D scan.

17
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,165
'Gray, over here!'

18
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,134
We think this was some kind of primitive computer, but...

19
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,144
This was just the user interface, Moira.

20
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,179
The memory anagrams may still be preserved.

21
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,172
Rizz rizz.

22
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:47,147
If the data we need is lost

23
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,151
all of New Gotham will be destroyed.

24
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:51,164
You need to get this machine on line.

25
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,155
Do you know how old this tech is?

26
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,164
What you're asking is impossible!

27
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,170
Find a way.

28
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:59,195
And remember, time is not a luxury we have.

29
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,181
Whoosh

30
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,177
I still can't believe we found the place.

31
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:07,242
You know, when I was a kid

32
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,185
my father read "Tales Of The Bat" to me

33
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,175
every night before bed.

34
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,179
He always said the stories were true.

35
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,180
Smart man, your father.

36
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,207
Beep.

37
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,227
Full scan complete?

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,188
It's the Batmobile, isn't it?

39
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,223
Let's find out.

40
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,243
It's exactly how I imagined it.

41
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,224
'Batman, confirm sighting.'

42
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:53,218
'He's at Gotham Airport.'

43
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,225
'Batman?'

44
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,241
'Batman, do you read?'

45
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,231
'What do you read, anyway?'

46
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:00,236
'After all these years, I never thought to ask.'

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,230
'Mystery stories, romance novels?'

48
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:04,237
' "The Sunday Comics?"'

49
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:06,268
I read, Oracle, loud and clear.

50
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:09,334
I'm heading to the airport.

51
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,251
It's the headaches again, isn't it?

52
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:16,234
Ever think that's Mother Nature's way of telling you

53
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:18,241
that you should be playing Bingo right now?

54
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,254
I'm fine. Today it ends.

55
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,269
This dance can't go on forever.

56
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,271
Swoosh.

57
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,281
'Are you sure this homemade anti-Freeze is gonna work?'

58
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:45,283
I've spent years studying Freeze's cryogenic biology

59
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:48,278
and how to neutralize it. It'll work.

60
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:51,311
'It better, because you know I am not a fan of plan B.'

61
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:55,312
bang.

62
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,314
Try again, Batman.

63
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,301
We didn't pierce the exosuit.

64
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,309
Guess it's time for plan B.

65
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,317
Great.

66
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:18,318
Swoosh

67
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,331
clang.

68
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:43,361
The Dark Knight returns.

69
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,356
'Batman, I've tapped into Air Traffic Control.'

70
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,349
'Gotham Tower has rerouted all flights.'

71
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,369
Good. Hm..

72
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,393
You'd think so

73
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,357
but a cargo plane from Africa

74
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,582
was already on final approach.

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,363
'It's out of fuel and its wings are icing over.'

76
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:20,397
'The pilot's issued a Mayday. He has to land now.'

77
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,415
Oracle, the Batmobile.

78
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,427
Swish swish swish.

79
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:51,422
When did this get so hard?

80
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:10,450
Thump crash.

81
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:31,434
Time, Batman, has made you weak

82
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,447
slow, irrelevant.

83
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,453
Facts you refuse to accept.

84
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,440
'Pathetic.'

85
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:41,449
Freeze, a man's life is at stake.

86
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,442
'That plane needs to land.'

87
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:47,471
And land it will crash-land.

88
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:06,466
Do it.

89
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,494
Beep.

90
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:13,497
That's more like it.

91
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:17,476
No wonder this place is still standing.

92
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,478
It's been secured with titanium reinforcements.

93
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:23,482
This much titanium in the 21st century?

94
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:24,627
It must have cost a fortune!

95
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,494
Who was this Batman?

96
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,559
We'll probably never know.

97
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,869
The details have been lost to time.

98
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,493
'Maybe not.'

99
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,492
According to records we found

100
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:34,513
the estate that was once above this cave

101
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:37,498
was owned by a Dr. Thomas Wayne.

102
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:38,515
We can't be certain

103
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,511
but I bet he was The Batman

104
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,515
which means his wife, Martha, may have been the Batwoman

105
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,510
and their young son, Bruce, the Red Robin.

106
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,535
- The Red what? - I'll show you.

107
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:58,525
The Batsuit.

108
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,519
Vacuum sealed.

109
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,522
Perfectly preserved.

110
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:04,567
'Look how small the Red Robin's uniform is.'

111
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,567
'I never realized Batman's partner was so young.'

112
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,542
The upgraded Freeze 2.0

113
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,550
comes complete with flame-proof cybernetics

114
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:27,551
and a shatter-proof, internal liquid nitrogen supply.

115
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:31,563
It's why your cold medicine didn't work.

116
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,554
'Oracle, the plane!'

117
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,557
Chill, Batman. I sent up a flare.

118
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,582
'Robin's on his way.'

119
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,576
Maybe you didn't get the memo, Oracle

120
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,569
but I've been going by Nightwing

121
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:48,573
for, oh, about a decade or so.

122
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:51,583
Oh, yeah! I don't know why I can't remember that.

123
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:54,573
'Maybe I should try saying it ten times in a row.'

124
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:55,592
'Nightwing, Nightwing, Nightwing.'

125
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,591
'Wing de-icers are at maximum capacity'

126
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:00,590
and still losing ground. Oracle, take control.

127
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,600
'Why? You got something better to do?'

128
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,614
Kinda. Yeah.

129
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,621
Mayday! Mayday!

130
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:22,634
Please stow all tray tables and unfasten your seat belt.

131
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,644
What are you doing? Whoa!

132
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,635
Boom.

133
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,651
Whoa!

134
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,672
Get out of here!

135
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,651
Whoa.

136
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,659
- Oracle. - 'Way ahead of you, wing gnat.'

137
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,687
'I've alerted Commissioner Yin and Chief Bennett'

138
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,653
'that the pilot's headed their way.'

139
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:07,664
'They've evacuated the airport'

140
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:09,664
'and their men have the place surrounded.'

141
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:11,654
Which means they're still waiting for us

142
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:14,686
to do the heavy lifting, right, Batman? Batman?

143
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:23,690
Sit this one out. I can handle Freeze.

144
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,673
Maybe it's time to pass the torch.

145
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:30,676
I'll pass the torch when the mission's over.

146
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,714
We both know the mission will never be over.

147
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,700
Where is it? Ugh!

148
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:48,699
Ah, the African Star.

149
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,702
A diamond, Freeze?

150
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,707
You brought that plane down for a diamond?

151
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:56,739
Diamonds are the hardest substance in the world, Batman.

152
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:58,712
I knew it was the only thing

153
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,699
that could survive the crash.

154
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:04,706
After all these years you're still nothing but a cheap crook.

155
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,749
As I've been trying to tell Batman

156
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,751
things change.

157
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,718
You see, Batman

158
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:20,733
the African Star is no ordinary diamond.

159
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,727
Its uniquely perfect structure

160
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,741
will allow it to act as an energy amplifier

161
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,746
for my cryo-cabin a machine with the power

162
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,741
to alter this city's weather forever!

163
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:32,771
Beep.

164
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,735
You think you got one more in you, old man?

165
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,766
I'm just hoping you can keep up, Robin.

166
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:44,750
It's almost poetic, don't you think

167
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:48,747
that that which is most precious to me, diamonds

168
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,757
'will allow me to achieve my ultimate dream'

169
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,772
turning Gotham into a frozen kingdom

170
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:56,791
over which I will rule.

171
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,831
'It's over, Batman.'

172
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:39,798
You've given this city all you have to give.

173
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,831
Now, it's time to sleep.

174
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,840
<i>So what was it that finally defeated The Bat?</i>

175
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,825
That's something probably lost to history.

176
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,841
I'd like to think, old age.

177
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,836
- 'Gray, progress report.' - Uh, yes, commissioner.

178
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,831
We've made a number of important historical discoveries.

179
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,839
Forget history. Have you found what we need today?

180
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,848
No, sir, nothing yet

181
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:12,832
nothing that will solve our problem.

182
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,848
'Gray, it's not a problem, it's a crisis.'

183
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,841
<i>Find something and find it fast</i>

184
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,880
<i>before New Gotham enters another ice age.</i>

185
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,854
- Somehow, this Dr. Frost... - Mr. Frost...

186
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:37,867
- Freeze. - Whatever!

187
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:40,877
Somehow, this 1000-year-old monster is destroying our city

188
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:42,879
and we can't seem to stop him!

189
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:45,897
Everyone is depending on you and your team, Gray!

190
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:49,891
What's the status of that computer?

191
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,885
We found data storage.

192
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:53,889
Huh.

193
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:55,874
If the code's recoverable

194
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,894
we'll have it online in a matter of minutes.

195
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,922
An antique wheelchair.

196
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:01,898
The Waynes employed an Alfred Pennyworth

197
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:04,927
for decades who would've been quite old near the end.

198
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,147
This must have belonged to him.

199
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:13,935
Batman, come in. Come in, Nightwing.

200
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,897
There's still no answer, Alfred. Radio must be down.

201
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,913
He's always seemed to think he wasn't doing his job

202
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,908
unless he worried me half to death.

203
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:24,941
I'm certain he's fine, Oracle.

204
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,931
Lopez Hair Removal, this is Jose.

205
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,943
It's dad, Barbara, just wanted to check in on you

206
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,927
you know, with everything that's going on.

207
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,553
'There's nothing for you to worry about.'

208
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:51,947
'And I am kind of busy right now.'

209
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,939
Well, if you weren't so mysterious

210
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,935
about that job of yours maybe I wouldn't

211
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,957
have to worry about you so much.

212
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:02,975
You never stood a chance against me, Batman.

213
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:12,953
Sorry, dad. I gotta go. Love you. See you tomorrow.

214
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,958
'Okay. Goodnight, Barbara. Love you, too.'

215
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:17,957
Batman's remotely ordered the Batwing

216
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,961
to fire on his position.

217
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,966
I can't override it.

218
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,964
Fire on himself? Oh, dear.

219
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:27,001
Senility has finally set in.

220
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,008
Huh?

221
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:40,008
Boom boom boom.

222
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,008
- Huh? - Ah..

223
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:53,000
Thanks for the ice pack, Freeze.

224
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:55,033
All you did was numb the pain.

225
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:25,029
Diamonds cut even the hardest glass.

226
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:28,027
How's that for poetic justice?

227
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,055
No.

228
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,079
Oh, no!

229
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:16,079
Not bad, old man. No sign of Freeze.

230
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:19,114
Which means the mission isn't over.

231
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:38,108
The cryo-chamber.

232
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:41,110
Cold enough to put me on ice..

233
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:44,117
Until someone wakes me up

234
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:48,124
and puts me back together in a future

235
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:51,134
without The Batman.

236
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:06,134
Still can't believe some fool woke Frost up

237
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,140
and put him back together.

238
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,129
It's not all bad.

239
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:11,148
Freeze's revival forced us to look for Batman

240
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:13,130
and we found him.

241
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,140
We didn't find Batman

242
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:17,147
we found artifacts, lots of pretty things

243
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,145
but unless we recover that data

244
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,181
nothing of substance.

245
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,142
It's no use.

246
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,158
This machine just wasn't built

247
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:25,187
to hold code for a 1000 years!

248
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,161
The memory anagrams are hopelessly degraded.

249
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:31,156
Unacceptable! Get us access.

250
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,164
It can't be done, I'm sorry!

251
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:34,196
Gray, your hand.

252
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,496
It's nothing. It's just a scratch.

253
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,193
A scratch with a pattern.

254
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:46,163
The titanium!

255
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,179
- Gray, what are you... - Binary code.

256
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:51,184
The titanium's covered with binary code.

257
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,177
'Batman knew they couldn't survive'

258
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:54,187
'on his primitive computer'

259
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:56,213
'so he found another way!'

260
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,184
Have we scanned it all?

261
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,191
Can you translate it?

262
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:02,208
Yes. Yes!

263
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,223
Here we go.

264
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,210
Welcome. If you're viewing this message

265
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:16,212
I can only assume one thing

266
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:19,202
the mission isn't over.

267
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:21,201
'State the nature of the emergency.'

268
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,210
Dr. Frost.

269
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,235
- Mr. Freeze. - Mr. Freeze.

270
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:34,248
Beautiful.

271
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:39,225
I love the future

272
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:43,239
especially since it's 100% Bat-free.

273
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:45,239
'If you believe that, Freeze'

274
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:48,232
'the cold must be numbing your brain.'

275
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:49,258
What?

276
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:54,235
No, it's not possible.

277
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,278
There's nowhere you can run!

278
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:01,282
But I waited a 1000 years.

279
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,261
You can't still be here!

280
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:06,259
And yet I am here

281
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:09,263
and always will be here to stop you, Freeze

282
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:10,289
always.

283
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,289
No!

284
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:17,258
It can't be!

285
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:18,284
'Freeze.'

286
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,293
No-o-o!

287
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:45,327
Mission accomplished. We did it, Gray.

288
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,308
But not without The Batman.

289
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:50,299
<i>Even a 1000 years</i>

290
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,298
<i>into the future, he refused</i>

291
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,324
<i>to leave Gotham unprotected.</i>

292
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,317
<i>Time changes nearly everything</i>

293
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:08,305
<i>but the mission and the legend</i>

294
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,336
<i>of The Batman lives on.</i>
