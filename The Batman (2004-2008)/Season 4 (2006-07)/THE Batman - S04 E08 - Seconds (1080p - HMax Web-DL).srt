1
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:15,031
Ah, there it is.

2
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,017
Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid!

3
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,049
Hey! Stop right there!

4
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,048
Oh. Oh!

5
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,059
Ha-ha. Smooth move, Colonel Klutz.

6
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,039
Alarm on the cabinet, go right in the hall

7
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:49,029
door is locked. Watch the bucket.

8
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:51,068
What're you talking about?

9
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,048
Whoops.

10
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:03,077
Hold on a minute, cowboy.

11
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:18,091
Hey, stop right there!

12
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:32,094
Smooth move, Colonel Klutz.

13
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:55,159
Last level, come on, almost there!

14
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,158
I don't believe Master Dick has moved

15
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:59,176
in the five days since you gave him his Christmas gift.

16
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,166
I would've given him a book

17
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,163
but then he might've learned something.

18
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:06,168
I am learning something. How to beat this game, Babs.

19
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,172
Call me Babs again, and that controller's...

20
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:12,172
Does anyone have any New Year's resolutions? Master Dick?

21
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:14,178
I resolve to kick more butt.

22
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:16,188
I resolve to leave more butts unkicked.

23
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,191
- Gotta leave some for Robin. - Har har.

24
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:22,197
How about you, Master Bruce? Any resolutions?

25
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:26,216
Same as every year, do my part to help Gotham City.

26
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:38,197
Blast! And I resolve to finally have this old clock repaired.

27
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,211
I got him down to half strength!

28
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:43,217
I own you, Draketh!

29
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:48,231
- Batwave. Let's move. - Now? Hrmm.

30
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:56,217
Another robbery at the chemical lab

31
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,218
this time at Gotham University.

32
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,221
Third one this week.

33
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:00,237
- Same perp? - Mm-hmm.

34
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:03,225
And I doubt he's done. Let's split up.

35
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:06,247
We can cover more ground if we each stake out a different lab.

36
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,274
Report in.

37
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,234
Nothing. Nada. Zip.

38
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:16,251
How about you, Robin?

39
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:18,248
All clear. Ahh!

40
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:21,280
I said I wanted to kick butt, not freeze mine off.

41
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,287
I've spotted our man.

42
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,297
Bingo.

43
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,311
Ah, the Batman.

44
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,281
I knew it was a matter of time before you showed up.

45
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:54,287
Then you know what's gonna happen next.

46
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:58,315
You try to stop me, and fail.

47
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,322
Okay, okay, let's try this again.

48
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:11,295
I knew it was a matter of time before you showed up.

49
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,324
You try to stop me, and fail.

50
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,341
Oh, yeah, that hurts.

51
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,339
You try to stop me, and fail.

52
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,317
Whoops! Missed me.

53
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:33,343
Ugh. You're quicker than you look.

54
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,362
Aha.

55
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,344
Lights out.

56
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,360
Huh?

57
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,369
Ah, typical.

58
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,377
Let's try this one.

59
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:13,371
It's been a barrel of laughs, Batman.

60
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,371
Oh, that's terrible.

61
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:19,401
Better luck next time, Batman.

62
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:39,380
'Let's look for a match.'

63
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:41,381
I know this doesn't make sense

64
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,400
but the whole thing seemed... staged.

65
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:46,384
Like he knew exactly what was going to happen.

66
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:48,414
Whatever helps you sleep at night.

67
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:02,412
It's almost done, Beth.

68
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,421
They stole you and Matt away from me

69
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:07,437
but soon they'll pay.

70
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:17,429
It's okay, Matt. It's okay. Daddy's here.

71
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,460
Shh. Shhshhshh.

72
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:27,428
How are we gonna pay all these bills?

73
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:30,452
Don't worry, honey. We'll get through this.

74
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,459
For once, I'm gonna make things right.

75
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,470
Yeah, I'll take a dog with the works.

76
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:52,472
- 'Night. - Goodnight.

77
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,505
<i>For once, I'm gonna make things right.</i>

78
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,508
Idiot!

79
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:32,531
Ahh!

80
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,531
Huh? Gas leak!

81
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,546
Run!

82
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:07,548
Ah, I can't do anything right!

83
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,533
Francis Grey was paroled last month

84
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:14,543
after spending 17 years in prison.

85
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,547
That's a long time to be away from your family.

86
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,552
Apparently, they thought so, too.

87
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,560
His wife left him while he was in prison.

88
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:24,582
He didn't see her or Matthew again.

89
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:28,547
Trying to set the time on your VCR?

90
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,549
The atomic clocks in the cave and my suit

91
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:32,553
should keep perfect synchronized time

92
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:35,564
yet there's a discrepancy of several seconds between the two.

93
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,559
- Strange. - Uh.

94
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,572
I hate being late, too

95
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,562
but shouldn't we be more concerned

96
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:42,565
with what Francis has planned with the chemicals?

97
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,570
Grey has most of the base components

98
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,577
to make radium tricholoromethate.

99
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,586
I'm guessing that's not the secret ingredient

100
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,611
in Alfred's eggnog.

101
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,590
It's a deadly poison gas.

102
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:53,587
He needs one more component

103
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,614
and there's only one place in Gotham he can get it.

104
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,599
You okay, Bats?

105
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:13,611
It's nothing, it's..

106
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:17,599
Just a sudden sense of deja vu.

107
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:18,608
Deja what?

108
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,600
It's a French term, describing when you feel

109
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,609
like you've experienced a situation before.

110
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:26,629
"Robin," by the way, is French for "Duh."

111
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,616
Why is it deadly chemicals are always green?

112
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,648
Why can't they ever be pink?

113
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,627
You're going back to the big house.

114
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,642
- This time for good, Francis. - You know who I am.

115
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,626
Then you know that my prison sentence was totally unfair!

116
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,637
- You committed a crime. - I took a watch!

117
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:52,632
Everything else was an accident.

118
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:54,676
For that, they put me away for 17 years?

119
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,653
You make one little mistake..

120
00:10:56,677 --> 00:11:00,682
And you spend the rest of your life paying for it.

121
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,653
- How'd you do that? - I don't know.

122
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,655
We've had this conversation before.

123
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,664
But that's impossible, isn't it?

124
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:10,654
- Unless.. - Time.

125
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:11,693
You can manipulate time.

126
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,660
And in such a way, you're the only one aware

127
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:16,668
you've experienced the previous moment.

128
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:20,661
It explains the atomic clock discrepancy, the deja vu.

129
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,668
Very good, Batman.

130
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,670
It's easy to become obsessed with time

131
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:26,675
when that's all you have.

132
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,711
<i>It was all I could think of when I was in prison</i>

133
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,672
<i>all the time that was stolen from me.</i>

134
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,692
<i>And when it became my job to fix all the guard's clocks</i>

135
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,687
<i>I was suddenly surrounded by it.</i>

136
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:40,685
<i>Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years.</i>

137
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,691
<i>I was so obsessed with the time I was losing</i>

138
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:47,699
<i>I began to actually see it unravel before me.</i>

139
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,703
Cuckoo, cuckoo!

140
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,721
<i>I thought I was going mad.</i>

141
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,724
Stop!

142
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:10,731
Huh?

143
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:30,763
<i>I could turn back time.</i>

144
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,753
<i>I spent every day of the next 15 years working on it.</i>

145
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:40,752
<i>One second became five seconds. Then 10, then 20.</i>

146
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,779
Whoa! Oh!

147
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,754
<i>I wanted to go back 20 years</i>

148
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:50,768
<i>before any of this happened.</i>

149
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,761
<i>But all I got was 20 seconds.</i>

150
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,765
I can't get my time back

151
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:58,767
but I can punish the city for taking it.

152
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,768
You know what time it is now?

153
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,799
Time to kick my sorry butt?

154
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,783
To you, this is all happening for the first time

155
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:11,787
but we've already had this fight eight..

156
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,816
No, nine. Nine times.

157
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,787
Left hook, right jab, spin kick

158
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:23,794
flying kick from Batgirl.

159
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,798
Left, right, right, right, left.

160
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:29,812
Right, right, left, right, left, left, right, kick!

161
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,802
That was fun. Thanks for playing.

162
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:35,805
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to make sure

163
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,824
that Gotham rings in the new year with a bang!

164
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,836
I don't care if he's Father Time himself

165
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,850
he is not outrunning us in that.

166
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,878
It's his power, that's how he's outrunning us.

167
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,846
It's like a video game.

168
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,840
He can play the same level over and over again

169
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:23,854
memorizing every move until he wins.

170
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:27,847
So everything is a do-over, including our memory.

171
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:29,861
Then this could be the 10th time we've had this conversation.

172
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,876
Whoa. Brain hurt.

173
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,891
Whoo-hoo!

174
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,921
I'm circling back to 8th street to try and cut him off.

175
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,908
This'll be fun.

176
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,923
I got him.

177
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:23,937
Here we go.

178
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:25,945
Not good.

179
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,941
So, how do we stop someone who..

180
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:02,950
Knows what we're gonna do before we do.

181
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:03,952
Deja vu again?

182
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:04,961
It seems to grow stronger

183
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:07,948
each time I face off against Grey.

184
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:09,952
Get any sense of what he's gonna do next?

185
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,993
He said he wanted Gotham to ring in the New Year with a bang.

186
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,968
Tonight's New Year's Eve celebration

187
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,000
in Gotham Times Square.

188
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,968
And thousands of people to hit with his poison gas.

189
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,970
Gotham Square's already filled with revellers.

190
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,983
An evacuation would only cause panic.

191
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:29,009
We have to find the device before it goes off.

192
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:38,006
Wait. I have a special mission for you.

193
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,005
Gotham will only understand how precious their time is

194
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,001
after it's taken away.

195
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:54,004
Hello, Batman.

196
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,037
I suppose we've been through all this before.

197
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,007
If it matters, you did catch me off guard.

198
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,022
But that only works the first time.

199
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,020
The New Year's ball.

200
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:08,015
That's where you've hidden the device.

201
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,021
And when it reaches zero

202
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:12,036
this city pays for what they took from me.

203
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,062
Only one minute to midnight, Batman.

204
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:31,072
Ice try, Batman.

205
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,039
Oh, I did not just say that.

206
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:36,044
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, I got it.

207
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:40,048
Ice pellet? That's cold, Batman.

208
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,048
Okay, so I'm not so good with quips.

209
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:45,043
Your deja vu telling you how this fight ends?

210
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,062
Yeah. Not well.

211
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:49,062
Then let's hope batgirl gets here soon with plan B.

212
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:52,058
Time's up.

213
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,078
Please..

214
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:58,071
You can't stop me. It's fate.

215
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:03,083
I don't believe in fate. I believe in choice.

216
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:15,076
You and your little toys.

217
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,106
It's adorable, really.

218
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:27,084
He can mess with time

219
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,131
but he can't be in two places at once.

220
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,131
Hmm.

221
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:51,152
I totally saw that coming.

222
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,134
Don't make all these innocent people suffer.

223
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:59,119
But I was innocent, too, Batman.

224
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:00,138
Where was my justice?

225
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:02,137
You made a choice 18 years ago

226
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,141
and you have to live with the consequences.

227
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:06,163
Don't make another mistake.

228
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,135
I don't make mistakes, Batman.

229
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,160
Not anymore.

230
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,162
Let's try that again.

231
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:24,182
Left jab. Ooh! Oh!

232
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,163
How are you doing that?

233
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:30,185
Call it deja vu.

234
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,172
Batman! Had a bit of trouble tracking him down.

235
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,194
But..

236
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:06,186
It's not too late to make the right choice, Francis.

237
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,190
Dad?

238
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,193
What're you doing?

239
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:12,202
Matt?

240
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:17,231
- Get out of here! - Four, three, two, one..

241
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:43,260
Dad..

242
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:49,250
My son! No!

243
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:00,259
Oh..

244
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,283
Nooo!

245
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:19,282
<i>It's not too late to make the right choice, Francis.</i>

246
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,283
How about you, Master Bruce? Any resolutions?

247
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:39,279
Same as every year, do my part to help Gotham City.

248
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:43,283
All set, Mr. Pennyworth.

249
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:45,283
You're a miracle worker, Mr. Grey.

250
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:49,287
Sure you won't join us for some eggnog?

251
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:50,331
No, thanks, Mr. Wayne.

252
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,329
I have my own family to get home to.

253
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:59,341
All done here, son. Let's get going.

254
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:03,341
Aw, dad!
