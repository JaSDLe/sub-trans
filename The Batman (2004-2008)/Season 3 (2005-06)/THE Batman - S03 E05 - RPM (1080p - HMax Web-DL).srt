1
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,017
Vroom vroom.

2
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,018
And the Gotham City Speedway

3
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:22,000
is off to an exciting start.

4
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:23,016
'The fastest racers in the country'

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,005
'have gathered here in Gotham'

6
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,025
'each striving for the charity of their choice.'

7
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:31,018
'And Gotham's very own Bruce Wayne'

8
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:34,015
'is the only non-pro racing today'

9
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,049
'for Gotham's Children's Hospital.'

10
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,037
swoosh swoosh swoosh.

11
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:50,055
'And Bruce Wayne takes the lead.'

12
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:53,043
Your loss, pop, I could've been driving

13
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,040
for the policemen's charity fund.

14
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,047
He-he, maybe you should finish driving school

15
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:00,068
before you decide to join the racing circuit, Barbara.

16
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,080
Boosh

17
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:10,091
thud That vehicle isn't registered.

18
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:20,103
Screech.

19
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,099
Who's crashing the race?

20
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:41,111
Stay close, Barbara.

21
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:50,126
Click click.

22
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:56,094
I won your race, so I'll collect the prize

23
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,124
for my favorite charity.

24
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,131
Me, Gearhead.

25
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,220
Clang clang clang.

26
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,213
Always wanted to race Gotham's finest.

27
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,207
The prize money should keep this mystery driver's

28
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:46,211
tank topped off for quite some time.

29
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:49,210
I don't think Gearhead's in it for the money, Alfred.

30
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:50,222
He likes the chase.

31
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:53,234
We're dealing with a thrill-seeker.

32
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:56,247
It's Gearhead.

33
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,223
Do buckle up, sir.

34
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,253
Could be a bumpy ride.

35
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,260
I think I may have trouble.

36
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,267
Boosh.

37
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,267
Ah!

38
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:33,294
Screech It's... driving itself?

39
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:55,293
Batman.

40
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:58,309
'Time to kick things up a notch.'

41
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,319
It's racing time.

42
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:14,295
Remember, hands at 10 o'clock

43
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,297
and at 2 o'clock.

44
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:19,322
I'm learning to drive and tell time.

45
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:25,304
Whoosh Gearhead!

46
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:28,337
Whoosh Batman!

47
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:39,348
Screech

48
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:41,344
bang bang

49
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:51,357
whoosh whoosh Ugh.

50
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:53,374
Oh. Hi.

51
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:06,370
Vroom

52
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
boosh

53
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,386
beep beep beep.

54
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:31,401
Let's check out your reaction time, Batman.

55
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:38,401
Screech honk.

56
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,439
Tch-tch. Shouldn't tailgate.

57
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:07,433
Beep boosh

58
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,445
screech

59
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:28,464
crash beep beep beep

60
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,466
boom

61
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:37,474
splash.

62
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:48,490
Ha ha ha!

63
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,493
Try buffing that out.

64
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:28,490
No time to be sentimental.

65
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,497
Gearhead will be looking for the next rush

66
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,492
and this is one villain the Batman

67
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:34,522
needs wheels to take down.

68
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,541
I'm gonna have to retool one of my prototypes.

69
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:44,525
I'm gonna have to build a better Batmobile.

70
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,526
<i>And I'll start by doing a little shopping</i>

71
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,552
<i>at Wayne Industries.</i>

72
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:53,547
<i>The Dual EXP Power Core.</i>

73
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,545
Crackle crackle

74
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,552
creak creak.

75
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,582
The power core's unstable at top speeds.

76
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,551
What an odd little giz.. Oh! Uh! My word!

77
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,558
Crackle crackle I assume that is not

78
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,566
an acquisition from Wayne Industries.

79
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,574
Gearhead Industries.

80
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:40,562
A souvenir from the armored car job.

81
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,570
It injects some kind of nano-virus into machinery

82
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:45,565
taking it over like a parasite

83
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,581
controlling it.

84
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,583
I aim to make sure this Batmobile

85
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,611
is Gearhead-proof.

86
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:55,586
'Barbara, the driving school tells me'

87
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,586
'you have quite the lead foot.'

88
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,584
The instructor was making me nervous.

89
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:01,597
Gordon.

90
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,625
Where? On my way.

91
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,600
Plumbing burst at the courthouse?

92
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,630
Gearhead. Sorry, Barb. Have to go.

93
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,631
Taking the car?

94
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:15,629
Kidding.

95
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,657
Gearhead is chasing the bullet train?

96
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,626
It was scheduled for a money transfer

97
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,731
from the Treasury Building.

98
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,662
But, sir, the power core has yet to charge.

99
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,661
I'll need an alternate mode of transportation.

100
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:49,665
Clang crackle crackle.

101
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:15,679
Ooh, two-wheeler.

102
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,687
Bang bang

103
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,714
boosh

104
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:33,715
whoosh.

105
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,712
'Autopilot on.'

106
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,719
Hey, no hitchhikers.

107
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:48,709
I really need my own set of..

108
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,712
Wheels.

109
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:01,725
'Let's lose the training wheels.'

110
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:08,747
screech

111
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,743
bang

112
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:21,750
whoosh.

113
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:23,738
He he he.

114
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,753
You're in for a surprise.

115
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,772
Hey! What're you doing?

116
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,770
Ha ha ha. Take a bus, Batman!

117
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,760
Ha ha ha!

118
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,771
He doesn't use nanotechnology.

119
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:58,786
He is nanotechnology.

120
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,803
Screech.

121
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,797
The Batcycle's autopilot isn't responding.

122
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,823
Screech.

123
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,832
Should've known.

124
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,820
'Alfred. Power core status.'

125
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,799
Charge is complete, sir.

126
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:38,809
'Lower the chassis.'

127
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,838
'I'm takin' it out for a spin.'

128
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,861
Do come back in one piece, won't you?

129
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,845
Okay, so I stole Batman's ride

130
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,847
and I lost Gearhead.

131
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,862
Not good.

132
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,863
Clang.

133
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,859
Even worse!

134
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,881
Aah!

135
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,867
You look a little young.

136
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,865
'You even have a driver's license?'

137
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,892
No. But here's my permit!

138
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,886
Clang

139
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:43,898
swoosh.

140
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,917
Whoa.

141
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,908
Clank clank clank.

142
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,916
Don't knock the student driver.

143
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,916
'Pretty cool, huh?'

144
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,934
Here's another trick I learned in machine shop.

145
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:43,943
Whoa.

146
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,964
You traded up, Batman.

147
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:07,984
Rematch! Ha ha ha!

148
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:09,987
Swoosh.

149
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,957
Nice landing.

150
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,997
Ooh! Corinthian leather?

151
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:22,991
Catch me if you can, Bats.

152
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,009
Crackle

153
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:50,018
whoosh

154
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,055
thud.

155
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,030
Whoo-hoo!

156
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,057
Screech screech

157
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,061
boosh.

158
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,066
Power core.

159
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:51,082
Thud

160
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,088
screech crash.

161
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,075
No one beats Gearhead.

162
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,079
- Road rage coming. - You hear me, Batman?

163
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:19,119
No one!

164
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:34,128
Thwack.

165
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:40,102
Gotta admit, Bat, that's one sweet ride you have.

166
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:42,126
He's jacking you!

167
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,144
Crackle crackle crackle.

168
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,157
What did you.. I'm stuck!

169
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,129
Nanotechnology, Gearhead

170
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,131
yours with some tweaks.

171
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,138
I still have the car. Time to roll.

172
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,164
Wouldn't recommend it.

173
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,167
Crackle crackle crackle

174
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:13,159
crackle.

175
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,178
So, uh, since Gearhead can't

176
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,173
drive the Batmobile, can I?

177
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:32,180
Any progress on power core calibration, sir?

178
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,175
Stable.

179
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,179
She's a keeper.

180
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:44,205
Click I didn't hear the bat-wave.

181
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,208
I just thought I'd take it for a spin.

182
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:57,219
Boosh screech

183
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,211
whoosh
