1
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:27,019
You're getting to be a real thorn in my side, Batman.

2
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,052
And you're no rose, Poison Ivy. Unh.

3
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:57,079
Why fight, Batman, when we can kiss and make up?

4
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:04,087
Aw.

5
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:09,086
Who will save you now, jimbo?

6
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:15,097
Yep, it's official.

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,078
I hate vegetables.

8
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,062
Batgirl.

9
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:25,072
For the last time, Ivy, it's woman. Batwoman.

10
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:28,069
And Commissioner Gordon won't be staying for dinner.

11
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:29,094
Devour her.

12
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:38,080
Oh!

13
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:41,109
Okay, Batman, awaiting your expert guidance here.

14
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:47,125
Ahh..

15
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:55,093
Seriously... help?

16
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:59,121
Go ahead, Batman, give your little lady friend a hand.

17
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,131
As you command.

18
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,129
Hey!

19
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:11,148
Guess you were serious about not wanting a sidekick.

20
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,219
Hey!

21
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,219
Oh..

22
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:39,220
<i>Hiya. You've probably been wondering what I'm doing here.</i>

23
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,247
<i>Fair enough. Yesterday, I was just your average teen</i>

24
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,467
<i>who was trying to find herself.</i>

25
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:52,225
<i>Today, I've got some majorly peeved petunias</i>

26
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:53,256
<i>nipping at my cape.</i>

27
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,234
<i>But enough about my new wardrobe.</i>

28
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:58,240
<i>Let me take you back to the beginning.</i>

29
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,229
<i>Now, if you think this all started</i>

30
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,249
<i>with a bad girl named Poison Ivy, you'd be wrong.</i>

31
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:16,258
<i>The situation came down the night before, at a plant.</i>

32
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,264
<i>Um, as in industrial, not vegetable.</i>

33
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:29,286
<i>And it started with a bad guy.</i>

34
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,269
Target sighted.

35
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:46,277
'Proceed with your mission, Temblor.'

36
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:49,288
Hello? Is this thing on?

37
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:52,314
'Yes, yes, the fine print.'

38
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,311
'Payment in full and in advance.'

39
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,314
Let's rumble.

40
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,338
Freeze!

41
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:44,337
'Officers need backup. Repeat, backup.'

42
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:45,364
It's on its way.

43
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,368
Hoo-yah!

44
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,363
Howdy. I'm Temblor.

45
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,385
Let's shake.

46
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:24,371
'Temblor, I'm waiting.'

47
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:27,402
'Have you completed your mission?'

48
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,403
Unh... unh.

49
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,392
Set up a perimeter.

50
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,697
If Mr. Quake so much as breathes.

51
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,531
I want someone there to tell me what he had for lunch.

52
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,402
It's okay to show yourself.

53
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,409
You're not on our most-wanted list anymore.

54
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,403
Force of habit.

55
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,411
Third building Temblor's taken out this week

56
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,408
and we still can't nail a pattern.

57
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,407
I'll nail a motive, he's work-for-hire.

58
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:10,442
I managed to borrow this from Temblor.

59
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,418
Gordon.

60
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:19,420
Uh, not a good time. What is it, Barbara?

61
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:20,428
It's your lucky night, pop.

62
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:23,433
No need to pick me up from gymnastics.

63
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:25,435
You skipped practice again?

64
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,441
You sound stressed. I should let you go.

65
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,627
'You're letting years of training slip down the drain.'

66
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,450
I just hope you're not out with Pamela Isley again.

67
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:36,478
I don't give you a hard time about the company you keep.

68
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,446
We'll talk when I get home.

69
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,448
You're with him right now, aren't you?

70
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:43,454
'No, yes. I..'

71
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:44,460
We're discussing a case.

72
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:47,462
Roger that, commish. Over and out.

73
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,490
My daughter. Teenagers, huh?

74
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,493
- Ready, Red? - Let's do it, Red.

75
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:16,505
This is a stick-up.

76
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:20,518
Psych.

77
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,490
Quite a mess, huh?

78
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,497
Well, not compared to the amount of pollution

79
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:33,512
your company, Chlorogene, dumps into our environment.

80
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:36,500
And don't even get me started on your whole

81
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:39,522
chloro-mulch-brand mutated super-vegetables.

82
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,531
- Unh. - We'll save you.

83
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,522
Security!

84
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,535
Good job, Red.

85
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:54,550
Ahh..

86
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,549
Hey!

87
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,532
You're a superstar, Red.

88
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,543
Years of training.

89
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,555
Beats hanging out at the mall, huh?

90
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,580
- Uh-oh. - Busted.

91
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,572
You two need a ride?

92
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,555
Barb, I'm concerned you're on your way to

93
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:33,569
blowing your shot at the Olympics.

94
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,566
What could've been more important than practice tonight?

95
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,600
Red and I were just out

96
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,585
trying to make the world a better place.

97
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,579
You know, for plants.

98
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:47,565
I'm all for green, Pamela, really, I am.

99
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:48,580
But I know from your juvenile-hall record

100
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,611
'that your methods can be a little extreme.'

101
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,577
'Now, sorry to cut the evening short'

102
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,600
but it's past my daughter's curfew.

103
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,606
Thanks for the ride, commish.

104
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,619
Barb, Pam's a bad seed.

105
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,610
You've traced the messages

106
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:20,598
to their source already, Master Bruce?

107
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,629
Bat-Wave's intercepting a live message, Alfred.

108
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:25,645
'Temblor.'

109
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,615
'I have a new target for you.'

110
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,617
I want you to destroy the corporate headquarters

111
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,657
of Chlorogene.

112
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:50,650
It's destruction must be total.

113
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:54,637
'Pammy, I need you to take out the trash.'

114
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,647
- 'Who was that?' - That was my henchman.

115
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,637
'I said take out the trash!'

116
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,649
In a minute.

117
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,640
'What about my pay?'

118
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:05,672
In full and in advance, as usual.

119
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,657
Wired straight from my piggy bank.

120
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,686
Yep, this should cover it.

121
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,681
And here I thought earthquakes struck without warning.

122
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:29,700
Buddy, you just dialed "D" for destruction.

123
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,713
Yah!

124
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:00,728
Yaah!

125
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,729
'I thought I'd seen it all, Barb.'

126
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:25,744
'You wouldn't believe the demolition'

127
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:28,737
'this Temblor character is capable of.'

128
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:29,772
But the Bat has a lead.

129
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,734
I think he's really gonna come through for us on this one.

130
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,751
So, when are you gonna invite the Dark Knight over

131
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,770
for your killer pork chops so I can meet him?

132
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,743
Beanbags "R" Us. This is Gary.

133
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,761
Hey, Red. I'm not done with Chlorogene

134
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,763
and their mutated super-plants.

135
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:48,757
What say you and me go down to their research labs

136
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,759
and try some persuasion on their scientists?

137
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:54,791
No can do. A parental unit is near. Gotta go.

138
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:57,775
The other Red?

139
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,776
Barb, she's trouble.

140
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,774
Pam's a good friend, and she gets the environment thing.

141
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,771
That's important to me.

142
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,768
Last month, Betsy was a good friend

143
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,771
and beekeeping was important to you.

144
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,786
Look, pop, if you're so concerned Pam is gonna steer me

145
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,773
down some criminal path just remember

146
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,780
I was pretty much set on becoming a detective

147
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:18,796
'until someone decided to get me'

148
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,787
'a mustachioed Eastern European gym coach'

149
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,801
so I could go for the gold.

150
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:26,789
Barb, law enforcement is dangerous work.

151
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:27,806
I don't want that life for you.

152
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,831
Maybe if you'd seen the mess Temblor made

153
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,795
at Neugog Chemicals tonight..

154
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,824
What? Neugog Chemicals?

155
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:43,812
Gordon. Batman and Temblor are at Chlorogene?

156
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,822
Just now? I'll be right there.

157
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:49,808
Sorry, hon. Duty calls.

158
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:52,820
Neugog Chemicals? Chlorogene?

159
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,825
Companies Red and I went to on protests

160
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,852
or scouting missions for Temblor's demolitions.

161
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,824
'Bat-Wave traced the messages to their source.'

162
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,830
Pamela Isley.

163
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:10,830
I know that name.

164
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:12,849
I just hope you're not out with Pamela Isley again.

165
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,842
Barbara Gordon's friend.

166
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,834
I do hope the commissioner's daughter

167
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:19,843
is not somehow involved in this enterprise.

168
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:20,879
So do I.

169
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,890
Get out before we call the police.

170
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,852
Had your chance.

171
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:35,864
'Sir, Bat-Wave is intercepting another live message.'

172
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:36,875
Put it through, Alfred.

173
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,866
'I have a new target, Temblor.'

174
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,868
'Chlorogene research labs. It's located..'

175
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:45,874
Yeah, yeah, it's just around the corner from me.

176
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,877
But before we discuss that

177
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:49,884
there seems to be a little problem

178
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,888
with the money transfers.

179
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:55,877
I'm sorry, but didn't you just blow the last job?

180
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,890
Listen, Temblor, if you're interested in getting

181
00:14:57,914 --> 00:15:01,907
'paid at all, you'd better get over here right now.'

182
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,896
I said here. Stupid.

183
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,904
Temblor?

184
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:08,929
Is he a friend from homeroom?

185
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,894
Looks like you caught me red-handed, Red.

186
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,895
Did one of your twigs snap, Pam?

187
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,906
You hired a thug.

188
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,917
You'd be surprised what you can find on the internet.

189
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:23,922
Pam, it's not too late. You have to stop this.

190
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,919
I don't wanna have to watch my dad

191
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:29,907
read you your rights.

192
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,922
And here I thought we were two peas in a pod.

193
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:34,946
Should've known I couldn't trust the commish's kid.

194
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:39,923
I'll miss you, Red. Ahh!

195
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,960
Well, well.

196
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,927
Lemme see how this works.

197
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:47,929
Testing.

198
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,950
'Testing.'

199
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,955
You are not at all how I pictured you..

200
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,970
Boss.

201
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,954
See, the way it works, boss

202
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,976
is when you don't pay..

203
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,957
You pay.

204
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,956
Hey, we're good for it.

205
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,986
We'll raise the funds with a bake sale.

206
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,973
You like brownies?

207
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,996
Later, Red. You two have fun.

208
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:31,986
I'm warning you, I'm-I'm an Olympic hopeful.

209
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,994
Rrrr!

210
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:04,043
Mutant tomatoes. Yum.

211
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,037
You've been terminated.

212
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,054
Huh..

213
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,075
Aah! Unh! Ahh!

214
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:02,081
Hmm..

215
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,124
Huh?

216
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:29,124
Ahh..

217
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:33,112
The Batman.

218
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,108
And he's..

219
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,122
He is awesome.

220
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,133
Red, help. I can't move.

221
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,121
Oh, no. Toxic sludge.

222
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:54,142
No. Hang on, Red.

223
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,127
That stuff mutates plants.

224
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,146
I don't wanna see what it does to humans.

225
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,169
Here comes the big one.

226
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,163
Yaah!

227
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,184
Aah!

228
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,180
No!

229
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,194
Oh..

230
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:02,205
Did you, uh, invite him for pork chops?

231
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,205
Will she be okay?

232
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:15,223
We'll know more after the detox procedure.

233
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,198
<i>Okay, I know.</i>

234
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:23,219
<i>You still wanna know how we get from here to here.</i>

235
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:25,216
<i>Well, believe it or not..</i>

236
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,207
Hyah!

237
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:30,248
<i>This, my friends, is only the beginning.</i>
