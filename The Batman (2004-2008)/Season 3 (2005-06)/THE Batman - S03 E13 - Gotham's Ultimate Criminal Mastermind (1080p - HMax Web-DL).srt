1
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:14,001
Imagine peering into the depths of the criminal mind

2
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:18,010
unlocking its terrible secrets.

3
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:21,017
I, Professor Hugo Strange

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,018
bring you the next generation

5
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:28,031
in crime-fighting technology.

6
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:37,023
The Digitally Advanced Villain Emulator

7
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,048
or D.A.V.E.

8
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:43,032
'D.A.V.E. is made up of the combined'

9
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,034
'psychological profiles'

10
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,042
'of the most diabolical criminals'

11
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:52,047
'committed to Arkham Asylum.'

12
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:56,045
'Designed to mimic their very thought patterns'

13
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:00,050
'D.A.V.E. can be relied upon to better catch these criminals'

14
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:05,063
'even anticipate their crimes before they're committed.'

15
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:10,058
D.A.V.E.'s artificial intelligence is so advanced

16
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:14,070
he doesn't even realize he's a computer program.

17
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:17,062
Professor, can we trust AI technology

18
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,058
that thinks it's a criminal?

19
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:20,073
Perhaps a demonstration

20
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:24,081
will allay your concerns, commissioner.

21
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:26,080
Good evening, Gotham P.D.

22
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:28,098
How might I assist you?

23
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,075
Now, D.A.V.E., what would you make

24
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,087
of the theft of 20 tons of ostrich feathers

25
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:41,082
and a break-in at Neugog Chemical both in the same night?

26
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:42,084
A Joker scheme.

27
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:43,092
The crime clown will threaten

28
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,101
to have the city tickled to death

29
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,087
by feathers treated with a Joker toxin

30
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:50,100
unless, that is, his ransom demands are met.

31
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:52,110
'A respectable crime, to be sure'

32
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:56,134
though I personally would commit something more elaborate.

33
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:01,118
If your mind didn't happen to be sentenced to life

34
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:04,120
in this electronic prison, D.A.V.E.

35
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,111
'On the contrary, professor'

36
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,120
'as long as I have my mind'

37
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,145
'Gotham City shall never be safe.'

38
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:15,157
Oh.

39
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:29,133
D.A.V.E., are you there? D.A.V.E.?

40
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,144
What just happened?

41
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:34,144
D.A.V.E. has uploaded himself off the server.

42
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:38,145
Gotham's ultimate criminal mastermind

43
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,178
has just escaped.

44
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:57,219
Hmm. I've no idea what could've caused this glitch.

45
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:59,237
Better call one of the techies down here.

46
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:04,241
Perhaps we should call the Batman instead.

47
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:07,229
The Dark Knight fights real criminals, professor

48
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:08,247
not floppy disks.

49
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,272
A real criminal is exactly

50
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:15,253
what the Digitally Advanced Villain Emulator thinks it is.

51
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:18,244
How can D.A.V.E. not realize it's a computer program

52
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,249
if it just uploaded itself?

53
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:26,246
The criminally insane create their own reality, Mr. Wayne.

54
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,263
And now I fear D.A.V.E. will attempt to carry out

55
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:34,271
his preprogrammed super-villain impulses.

56
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:38,285
And how exactly is it supposed to do that without a body?

57
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:54,312
Huh?

58
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,320
Reprogramming?

59
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:43,340
Wha-what are you?

60
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:46,334
Not what.

61
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:47,363
'Who.'

62
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:50,367
I like your coat.

63
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:58,341
Now let's turn to Dan Robbins with the wea..

64
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:01,344
Hello, Gotham, I am D.A.V.E.

65
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,362
For years you have listened to the idle threats

66
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:06,365
of criminals who have vowed and failed

67
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,354
to bring the city to its knees.

68
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:11,367
'Well, I am no ordinary criminal.'

69
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:15,367
I am Gotham's ultimate criminal mastermind.

70
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:18,372
And I'm about to prove that even the most heavily

71
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:22,364
'secured institutions can't prevent me from committing'

72
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:27,369
'the ultimate crime a crime of such scope and genius'

73
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:31,385
that soon all of Gotham will be mine.

74
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,375
A tad cliche, isn't he?

75
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,382
Pure textbook announcing his crime over the airwaves

76
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:40,380
a massive ego trademarks of the villain profiles

77
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:41,398
that make up D.A.V.E.'s brain.

78
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,426
So where will D.A.V.E. strike?

79
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,397
Nothing is more heavily secured

80
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:49,394
than Gotham's most powerful supercomputer.

81
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:52,397
That contains the city's most sensitive data

82
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,395
financial and otherwise.

83
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,407
And in the wrong hands

84
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:59,421
that data could bring the city to its knees.

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,419
Estimated lack of consciousness, ten minutes, 34 seconds.

86
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:21,420
Estimated completion of data acquisition

87
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:24,451
nine minutes, 15 seconds.

88
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:45,478
Crash Good evening, gentlemen.

89
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:48,479
Pew pew pew.

90
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:58,501
A million possible security codes.

91
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,486
Let's try them all.

92
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
Timing is everything.

93
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,518
Ah. The central data server.

94
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:37,536
Gotham City, in the palm of my hand.

95
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,514
The Batman. You're late.

96
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,619
Didn't know I was expected.

97
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,513
My superior intellect considers all possible actions

98
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:54,550
including the most predictable ones.

99
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,532
Crash.

100
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:14,532
Don't let my appearance fool you, Batman.

101
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:15,550
My mind is most human.

102
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:18,578
Or should I say, superhuman?

103
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,562
D.A.V.E., why are you doing this?

104
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:31,555
Did you say why?

105
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,565
Why do you dress like a bat?

106
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,569
Why do you fight crime?

107
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,567
Why do we do anything, Batman?

108
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:41,580
I do what I do because I have made it my purpose

109
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:45,573
like you have made it yours to stop me.

110
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:48,589
But shall fail trying.

111
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:57,604
Go ahead, Batman, save yourself.

112
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:01,606
Thud.

113
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,632
Hello again, Gotham.

114
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,600
Now that preparations are complete

115
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,614
on with the crime itself.

116
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:24,634
Involving all of Gotham's major banks.

117
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,619
Now, most great crimes are built on the foundation

118
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:33,626
of monetary gain diamonds, gold, art, etcetera.

119
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,655
But pilfering mere money is so passe these days.

120
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:43,631
'That is, unless one steals..'

121
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,646
'...everyone's money.'

122
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,678
Voila, I'm rich, you're not.

123
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,646
The ultimate crime should induce mass hysteria

124
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,682
because fear is the felon's friend.

125
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,672
Oh, and what crime is complete

126
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:18,689
without the personal touch.

127
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:21,703
'My calling card.'

128
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,699
And there you have it, Gotham. The ultimate crime.

129
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,714
You would probably like your tracking device back.

130
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,691
Another predictable move.

131
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:39,681
Then my next move won't surprise you either.

132
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:40,717
Boom.

133
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,696
Not only am I smarter than you, Batman

134
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,722
I am faster and stronger.

135
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,735
Thud.

136
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:14,723
With one snap I can accomplish what no villain has before

137
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,745
but breaking bones is also passe.

138
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:22,735
'Your defeat must be the ultimate defeat.'

139
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,725
So until we meet again, Batman

140
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:28,746
today's crime concludes with this

141
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,764
my getaway.

142
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,748
The good news is emergency power is operational.

143
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:43,745
The bad news, your bank account is empty.

144
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,748
Right now, I'm more concerned with finding a way to defeat

145
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,765
the sum total of my greatest enemies.

146
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:51,794
I'm hoping this diagnostic of D.A.V.E.'s original hard drive

147
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,782
will shed some light on that.

148
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,761
Sir?

149
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,758
According to this D.A.V.E.'s escape

150
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:00,776
from Gotham P.D. wasn't a glitch.

151
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,776
It was preprogrammed.

152
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,766
How very odd.

153
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,805
Not odd, Alfred. Strange.

154
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,786
'Strange.'

155
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,820
Ah.

156
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,786
The Dark Knight returns.

157
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,799
D.A.V.E.'s escape was no accident. Was it, professor?

158
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:29,788
You are not suggesting that I deliberately released.

159
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,810
Gotham's ultimate criminal mastermind?

160
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm suggesting that you might find Arkham

161
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,796
a better home than office.

162
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,812
The line between genius and insanity

163
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:44,831
is often blurred.

164
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:55,822
Didn't know you were such a fan.

165
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:58,831
Your obsession with criminals fascinates me

166
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:01,837
as much as the criminals themselves.

167
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,822
Shut down, D.A.V.E. now!

168
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:07,831
I may have created D.A.V.E., Batman

169
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:10,832
but I no longer control him.

170
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,831
Then tell me how to stop him.

171
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:17,838
You can't. You see, he was designed to stop you.

172
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:21,849
D.A.V.E. enacted his crimes to bait you into encounters

173
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,854
'in order to study you.'

174
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,861
And why would he wanna study me?

175
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:29,850
Because I also programmed my psychology

176
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:31,855
into D.A.V.E.'s brain.

177
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,858
D.A.V.E. shares my fascination with you, Batman.

178
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,876
'And, by now, has probably learned'

179
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,885
'all there is to know about you.'

180
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,902
Yes, yes, one moment.

181
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:58,899
Good evening. Is the Batman home?

182
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:10,930
Welcome home... Bruce.

183
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,911
You should have told me you were stopping by.

184
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,909
The place is a mess.

185
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,916
Humor, often used as a coping mechanism

186
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,919
in high-stress situations.

187
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:24,918
But I am not here to trade quips, Bruce.

188
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,912
I am here to destroy you.

189
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:31,922
But how does one best destroy your alter ego, the Batman?

190
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:35,941
One allows him to destroy himself.

191
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:45,934
Alfred.

192
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,932
I present you with a game.

193
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:51,929
'I call the No-Win Situation.'

194
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,976
'The red button is wired to your Batwave'

195
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,955
'which is set to transmit your secret identity'

196
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:00,964
'to all of Gotham city.'

197
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:12,965
'The blue button is wired to a device that if activated'

198
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:17,969
'will send your closest ally in the world to his doom.'

199
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,967
Press the blue button and you save Mr. Pennyworth

200
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,973
but reveal your secret identity.

201
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,975
'Press the red button and you protect your identity'

202
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,982
'but lose your dear friend.'

203
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:32,989
'So choose your poison, but choose it soon'

204
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:37,993
because when this hourglass empties, you forfeit both.

205
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:42,012
Gotham needs the Batman more than you need a butler, sir.

206
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,017
I've made my choice.

207
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:53,027
None of the above.

208
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,017
How very predictable.

209
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,021
I anticipated you would try to create

210
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,045
a third, more favorable option.

211
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,040
You probably want to know how I uncovered your secret.

212
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:28,070
It was simple, really.

213
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,040
Using information readily available to anyone

214
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:34,039
I began by narrowing down Gotham's population

215
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:37,045
<i>of 750,832 males.</i>

216
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:40,043
<i>Those not falling inside the Batman's age range</i>

217
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,042
<i>of 18 to 36, were eliminated.</i>

218
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,054
<i>Medical records revealed body type matches.</i>

219
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,061
<i>Tax records indicated those who possess the wealth</i>

220
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:48,064
<i>and resources to create his technology.</i>

221
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,066
'But the true key to the puzzle'

222
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,051
'was deducing who of the remaining candidates'

223
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,059
'had motive to become the Batman.'

224
00:17:55,083 --> 00:18:00,059
After all, every great hero must have an origin.

225
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,079
And once Gotham's ultimate criminal mastermind

226
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:08,066
put it all together, the answer was obvious.

227
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,106
Bruce Wayne, son of the late Thomas and Martha Wayne.

228
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:19,101
Thud.

229
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:37,117
So, Bruce Wayne, you no longer need to hide behind this.

230
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,117
Impressive. You have all the answers, D.A.V.E.

231
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,151
Except one.

232
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,123
Every great super-villain has an origin too.

233
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:56,136
What's yours?

234
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:03,140
My origin? I, I fell into a chemical bath.

235
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:06,134
- That's Joker. - A cryogenic mishap.

236
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,170
No, I lost my family fortune.

237
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,148
Freeze. Penguin.

238
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:13,174
I was a mad psychiatrist using Arkham as my cover.

239
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,150
That's Professor Strange, your creator.

240
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:20,142
You can't remember your origin because it doesn't exist.

241
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,173
You're a computer program.

242
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,165
But I am Gotham's ultimate criminal mastermind.

243
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:31,176
I consider all possibilities.

244
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:37,164
How could I not have considered this?

245
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:39,179
Crash.

246
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:52,191
You may not have a beginning.

247
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:57,212
But now you have an end.

248
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,189
No!

249
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,204
Thud.

250
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,192
D.A.V.E. shall make the ultimate addition

251
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:11,223
to the trophy room, sir.

252
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,212
There will be other opportunities

253
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:30,224
to peer behind the mask, Batman.

254
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:33,222
For if you think you have defeated.

255
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:38,233
Gotham's ultimate criminal mastermind..

256
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:41,245
Think again.
