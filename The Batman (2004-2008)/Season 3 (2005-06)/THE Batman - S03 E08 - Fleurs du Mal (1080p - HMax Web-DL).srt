1
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:09,004
'Oh, believe me, Councilman Vargas'

2
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:12,005
I love Gotham Park as much as you do.

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,996
But our citizens need a new hospital.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,997
And the only feasible way to accomplish that

5
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:20,006
is to pave over the park.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,024
Knock knock Come in.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,014
Come in!

8
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:31,013
That's my decision, unpopular as it may seem.

9
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,017
Goodnight.

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,051
Knock knock.

11
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,027
Flowers?

12
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:45,062
Well, I guess somebody out there still likes me.

13
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:10,115
I love this park as much as you do.

14
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,300
So believe me when I tell you

15
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,150
Gotham Park isn't going anywhere ever!

16
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,135
In fact, this will be the first site

17
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,135
to benefit from my new plan to..

18
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,156
' "Green Up Gotham."'

19
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:33,146
We'll tear up the sidewalks to plant more grass

20
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,177
more trees, and more flowers!

21
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,146
Time for mild-mannered Barbara Gordon

22
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,166
to scope out the commissioner's office for some cases.

23
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,153
Delivery for Commissioner Gordon.

24
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:54,171
- ' "Baudelaires?" ' - 'You can leave 'em there.'

25
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:56,193
You got it, commissioner.

26
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:03,172
Secret admirer, pop?

27
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,201
Hmm.

28
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,171
"From Mayor Grange."

29
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:11,169
Didn't think you were his type.

30
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,188
Oh, the mayor's really running wild

31
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,187
with this whole "Green up Gotham" thing.

32
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:18,181
Politicians. How was school, Barb?

33
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:20,222
Me learned good today. How's work?

34
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,183
Neck-deep in a new case.

35
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:26,201
Penguin, huh? What crime did he commit this time?

36
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:30,196
A daughter can't take an interest in her father's work?

37
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,195
We can catch up at dinner, kiddo.

38
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,193
Okay, but don't work too hard.

39
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:37,237
Remember to stop and smell the... whatever those are.

40
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,209
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

41
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,211
I beg your pardon, Master Bruce.

42
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,797
I seem to be suffering from a touch of..

43
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,220
Oh! Hay fever.

44
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,236
Most unusual this time of year.

45
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,226
That's not all that's unusual, Alfred.

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,238
Penguin went to a whole lot of trouble

47
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:06,230
to steal a truckload of chemicals last night.

48
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:08,245
Might he be planning to poison the water supply or..

49
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,248
Blow something up?

50
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:15,237
The chemical Penguin took is nontoxic and noncombustible.

51
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:18,256
- ' "Ag-I." ' - 'Silver Iodide.'

52
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,245
Used to make photographs or seed clouds for precipitation.

53
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,273
So, Penguin either wants to start a photo album..

54
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:30,282
Or he wants to make it rain. The question is why.

55
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,305
Clank clank clank.

56
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:58,291
Ha ha ha!

57
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:01,282
'Can't say I'm in the mood for rain, Penguin.'

58
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,288
Quack!

59
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:06,311
I just washed my car.

60
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,293
Too bad, Bat-breath.

61
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:17,302
Because my forecast calls for a 90 percent chance of showers..

62
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:18,335
Crash

63
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:27,335
and 100 percent chance of me kicking your butt!

64
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:33,354
Thud.

65
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,333
Since when are you so interested in the weather, Penguin?

66
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:39,326
Don't you read the papers, Bat-wit?

67
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,358
The mayor wants to green up Gotham.

68
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,375
Wa ha ha ha ha!

69
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:18,381
Clang What?

70
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,405
I bet chopped bat makes good fertilizer.

71
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,421
Whoa. Aah!

72
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,424
Boom

73
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:57,427
crash.

74
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,424
Penguin?

75
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,451
Plant matter.

76
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:27,470
Commissioner, moments ago, this mulch was Penguin.

77
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,430
Never mind that.

78
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:31,935
I thought I could count on you, Batman

79
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,614
but if you won't obey the law

80
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,443
then I will place you under arrest.

81
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,460
On what charge?

82
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,444
Homicide.

83
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,482
You killed this plant.

84
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,493
Click.

85
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,478
Take him downtown.

86
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:00,471
Since when is it against the law to harm a plant?

87
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:03,461
Since this afternoon, when the city council

88
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:05,494
passed the vegetation rights act.

89
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:10,503
Alright, plant killer, let's go.

90
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:12,514
Smack

91
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,509
bam bam bam

92
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,538
swoosh boom

93
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:52,520
whoosh beep Sir?

94
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:53,526
'Anything strange'

95
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,515
'on the radar, Alfred?'

96
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,529
You mean, anything beside city council

97
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,540
announcing a ban on lawnmowers?

98
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,530
Oh! Forgive me, sir.

99
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,535
'My hay fever has grown even worse'

100
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,526
'since your flowers arrived.'

101
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,533
Flowers?

102
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:14,535
"From Mayor Grange. Keep Gotham green."

103
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,570
Alfred, destroy them. Now!

104
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,564
The mayor is cultivating rather unusual plants, sir.

105
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:30,555
He isn't the only one.

106
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,568
The police aren't themselves all the way up to..

107
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:34,596
Gordon.

108
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,579
- 'Sir?' - Barbara may be in trouble.

109
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:49,599
- Huh? - Hello, Barbara.

110
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:54,577
Pop, do we need to put a bell on you?

111
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,594
Dinner will be ready in a few.

112
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:58,596
I brought you something.

113
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,598
The mayor's secondhand stems.

114
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,584
How sweet.

115
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:06,605
No, Barbara, these were picked especially for you.

116
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,621
Smell them.

117
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:12,634
Fishy.

118
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,631
What? Don't you trust me?

119
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,622
I trust my dad.

120
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,634
And you're a little too into flowers to be him.

121
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,647
Daddy's angry.

122
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,666
Daddy's green.

123
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,666
Thud

124
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:02,664
bam bam bam.

125
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,667
Not even close to human.

126
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:16,669
- You thinkin' who I'm thinkin'? - Poison Ivy.

127
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:19,660
And apparently working with a new strain of plant life.

128
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,674
But if she's replacing people with living plant clones

129
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:25,665
'what's she doing with the originals?'

130
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,686
Maybe we should ask the florist.

131
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,670
' "Baudelaires."'

132
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:33,699
Let me slip into something more comfortable.

133
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,713
Ting ting ting.

134
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,727
Oh, are you here for some... bam.

135
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,736
You knew she was a plant, right?

136
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,745
I'm betting this doesn't lead to the break room.

137
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:16,754
Whoa.

138
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,759
'Pop.'

139
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:31,749
No.

140
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:35,740
Ivy's replaced the most powerful people in Gotham.

141
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:37,735
'Well, of course.'

142
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,758
Who better to help me spread the gospel of green?

143
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,785
Release them, Ivy.

144
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,746
Why? They've never been happier.

145
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,746
See, while their plant twins

146
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,766
pave the way for my Gotham takeover

147
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,753
tiny plant toxins are working overtime

148
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:55,773
helping these human counterparts

149
00:12:55,797 --> 00:13:00,783
'to finally appreciate the wonders of nature.'

150
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:06,795
Green is good.

151
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,782
Ivy and clovers and dandelions.

152
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:16,777
It's all so pretty.

153
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:19,793
They'll love plant life just as much as I do

154
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:23,787
for the rest of their unwaking days.

155
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:26,823
There's one slight problem with your plan, Ivy.

156
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,827
Us.

157
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,815
Aww, bummer.

158
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,822
But here, flowers always cheer me up.

159
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,827
I bred these darlings myself.

160
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:05,867
They possess highly-evolved replication characteristics.

161
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,868
Nature's little mimics, I call them.

162
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:14,840
What do you say we go turn the rest of Gotham into plant-peeps?

163
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,839
I'm up for it.

164
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,858
Let's party.

165
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:21,856
It'll be a snap.

166
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,859
These pups are ultra-fast growing with plenty of water.

167
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:30,861
And with millions of seeds already planted in Gotham Park

168
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:36,876
I'm gonna just love watching my garden grow.

169
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,884
Oh, and don't worry.

170
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:51,905
In just a few moments, you'll be feeling right as rain.

171
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,900
Huh? The Batman?

172
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:08,930
You are going to love it here!

173
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,904
Hey, everybody, look who's checking in!

174
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:17,920
- I like posies. - Everywhere.

175
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,940
It's so... pretty.

176
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:43,923
Beep beep beep Brain activity low.

177
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,925
Possible cause, obstruction.

178
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,970
Transmitting electronic pulse.

179
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,969
Crackle crackle crackle

180
00:15:54,971 --> 00:16:00,965
splash.

181
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:07,967
Five more minutes.

182
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,978
Aww!

183
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,969
Are you alright, commissioner?

184
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,959
Oh.

185
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,960
As long as I never have to pick another daisy.

186
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:23,983
You're not through picking yet.

187
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,991
They need your help.

188
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,003
'All fixed.'

189
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:35,976
Gotham's human population is about to be canceled

190
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,014
on account of rain.

191
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,021
Ivy's finished.

192
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:53,024
Here comes your evil twin.

193
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,007
Mine can't be far behind.

194
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,027
I'm right here, ugly.

195
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:13,055
Boom bam

196
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,059
swish swish swish swish.

197
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,060
Try again.

198
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,053
Clang clang clang.

199
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:45,087
Ha!

200
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:49,063
You must not like broccoli.

201
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,092
Hate it.

202
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,088
Snap

203
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:03,097
thwack thwack thwack

204
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:08,098
gulp boom

205
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:18,114
crash.

206
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,135
Let it pour.

207
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:57,159
Drink up, my babies.

208
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:04,148
Too late. Get them!

209
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:10,161
Swoosh

210
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:16,174
boom Direct hit.

211
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:21,151
But it's still pouring.

212
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,157
The projectile was filled with

213
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:25,171
a highly concentrated herbicide.

214
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,163
It's raining weed-killer.

215
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,182
No!

216
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:44,184
Attack!

217
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,198
Thud thud.

218
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,189
My babies.

219
00:19:57,213 --> 00:20:00,181
Your babies are mulch, Ivy.

220
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:03,212
Thanks for doing your part to green up Gotham.
