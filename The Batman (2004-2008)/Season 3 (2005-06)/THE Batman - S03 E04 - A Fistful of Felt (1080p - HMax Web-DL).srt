1
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:15,037
'Well, you said we should try makin' our own money.'

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,039
Now, we'll be makin' as much as we want of it.

3
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:25,020
Sir, uh, I meant we should try making <i>honest money.</i>

4
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:27,021
- Ow! - Shut up, dummy!

5
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:29,025
When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you!

6
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:32,027
Yes, sir. Sorry, Mr. Scarface, sir.

7
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:35,039
Now, grab those plates!

8
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:42,056
'I see you're still carrying that dead weight around.'

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,038
Believe me, Batman, I tried ditching the bum

10
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:51,073
but he follows me everywhere I go.

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,043
I was talking to the Ventriloquist.

12
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,075
Well, talk to this!

13
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:04,075
Clink clink clink.

14
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,086
'Pennies from heaven!'

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,087
Don't forget your change!

16
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:37,099
Look, whose face is gonna be on the new nickel.

17
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,137
Vroom

18
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:49,176
thump thump thump

19
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:58,181
whirr whirr whirr

20
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,197
thump.

21
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,197
Huh?

22
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:14,201
Out of the fryin' pan, and into the fire!

23
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:27,222
Run, dummy!

24
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,218
Crash.

25
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,231
Tails. You lose.

26
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:45,224
'For today's exercise, I want each of you'

27
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:50,211
'to reach deep within your criminal minds.'

28
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:56,241
And have a one-on-one with the innocent voice within.

29
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,224
Mine's not talking!

30
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:03,231
Must be a mime.

31
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:06,235
Uh, very well, Joker.

32
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:09,245
Anyone else, care to share?

33
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,246
I'd like to share somethin'.

34
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,278
I don't belong in here with the rest of you nut jobs.

35
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,245
Ooh!

36
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,252
Little <i>old to be playing</i>

37
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,245
with dolls, aren't you?

38
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,284
Who you calling doll?

39
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,262
I'll make you eat that monocle!

40
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:28,291
Well, he's, he's only goofing on you.

41
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,256
Maybe you would like to eat the monocle.

42
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,273
You have quite an interesting friend there, Mr. Wesker.

43
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:44,263
Tell me, why do you allow him to speak to you that way?

44
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:47,266
The dummy's lucky I speak to him at all!

45
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,305
Fascinating!

46
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,275
'Uh, Mr. Wesker.'

47
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,290
After listening to you today

48
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:03,286
I would like to propose a radical treatment program

49
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,331
one which I believe might yield dramatic results.

50
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,291
W-we'll do whatever will make us

51
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:13,302
upstanding citizens, Professor Strange.

52
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,302
Speak for yourself, dummy!

53
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:17,312
Oh, no, no, Mr. Wesker.

54
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:22,333
This treatment is not intended for the both of you.

55
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,318
Uh! Ah! What are you doing?

56
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,331
Let go of me!

57
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:32,328
- Oh, no! - Now.

58
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,326
There is someone whom

59
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,354
I would like you to meet.

60
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:47,341
Children are Gotham's greatest resource.

61
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:50,345
And the new interactive children's museum

62
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,371
will help their minds grow strong.

63
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:58,349
Now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce

64
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:01,350
the key architect of this undertaking.

65
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,377
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

66
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,381
Hey! What's that? Look!

67
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,363
Thank you, Mayor Grange.

68
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,369
The dramatic entrance is intended to represent

69
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:28,374
that while, I may fall from the sky, money doesn't.

70
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:29,386
Which is why Wayne industries

71
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,382
will provide the funds necessary

72
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:34,373
to transform Gotham's old fish cannery

73
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:37,409
into its future pride, "The Discover Drome."

74
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:05,416
'Congratulations, Arnold Wesker.'

75
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,441
You are a free man, in more ways than one.

76
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:16,414
Hmm!

77
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:18,419
Thank you, Professor Strange.

78
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,445
Thank you for everything.

79
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,428
What is it, Alfred?

80
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:32,448
The Discover Drome invitations arrived misspelled, sir.

81
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:37,442
Apparently, you are hosting <i>"a farty."</i>

82
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,483
Not a good time. I'm tracking Arnold Wesker.

83
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,453
'The Ventriloquist?'

84
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:45,446
'Wasn't he declared cured, sir?'

85
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,461
Maybe too soon.

86
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:50,451
'The Batwave recorded him talking about doing a job'

87
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,468
'and the upscale penthouse I'm staring at'

88
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,475
'would fall into that category.'

89
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:58,456
'I just don't see Wesker having the nerve'

90
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,500
to go through with it without his little friend.

91
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:05,506
Unless he smuggled Scarface out of Arkham.

92
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,503
Wesker's making his move.

93
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,515
Show is over, Ventrilo!

94
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:37,527
Will you be my friend?

95
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,506
This is your... job?

96
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,516
Entertaining children.

97
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,506
I have a new life now, Batman.

98
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,513
And thanks to Professor Strange

99
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:52,512
a silly new friend.

100
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:53,529
I'm Mr. Snoots.

101
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:56,527
'My favorite color is green!'

102
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,545
What's yours?

103
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,525
<i>You may not know his face</i>

104
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,538
<i>but you remember the voices</i>

105
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,533
<i>of the many whacky characters</i>

106
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:09,529
<i>he performed on TV's beloved.</i>

107
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:10,549
<i>"Cockamamie Junction."</i>

108
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:14,549
<i>After the show's cancellation, puppeteer Arnold Wesker</i>

109
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,546
<i>took a new act on the road</i>

110
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,540
<i>with little success.</i>

111
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,546
<i>In a bizarre twist, Wesker developed</i>

112
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,584
<i>a true split personality</i>

113
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,548
<i>and embarked on a life of crime</i>

114
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,561
<i>becoming the underworld kingpin known as.</i>

115
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:30,555
<i>"The Ventriloquist."</i>

116
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,560
<i>Now, after extensive therapy.</i>

117
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,557
<i>Arnold Wesker is having a fresh start, at what he does best.</i>

118
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:38,558
<i>Bringing children joy.</i>

119
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:39,598
Who wants candy?

120
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,607
Rather unsettling, if you ask me.

121
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,571
I'm hoping Wesker's rehabilitation is for real.

122
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:50,571
I think I'll consult with Arkham's

123
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:53,596
chief of psychiatry, Hugo Strange.

124
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,595
I'm most certain Arnold Wesker would be delighted

125
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,592
to perform at your gala, Mr. Wayne.

126
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,598
I'm just a little concerned that the valuables

127
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,596
at our fund-raising auction might provide

128
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,586
a temptation for him.

129
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,633
Are you certain Wesker's... cured?

130
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,611
I'm certain that Arnold Wesker can be trusted..

131
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:19,620
As long as Scarface stays out of the picture.

132
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,619
You've put my mind at ease, professor.

133
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:26,634
My pleasure, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:37,653
Of course... should Scarface reappear.

135
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,629
'Oh! Do you hear that, Mr.. Snoots?'

136
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:47,669
A big job!

137
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,639
Hot diggety!

138
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,650
I know the kids will love your performance.

139
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,650
There's also gonna be a fund-raising auction

140
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:57,638
of some extremely valuable sports memorabilia.

141
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:59,646
Wow! Snoo-ter-ific!

142
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,751
Well, thank you, Mr. Snoots!

143
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,655
I'll see you and your buddy Arnold

144
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,681
Saturday night.

145
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,680
Have a silly day!

146
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:12,656
Well, sir?

147
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,655
Wesker <i>seems okay.</i>

148
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,682
I sure hope that's the case.

149
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:26,666
Mr. Snoots! I thought we'd celebrate tonight.

150
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,702
'Your <i>favorite, chocolate chip pancakes!'</i>

151
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,683
Mr. Snoots?

152
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,688
Where are you?

153
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:41,715
Mr. Snoots?

154
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:46,726
Have you been snacking between meals again?

155
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,704
Oh!

156
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:57,702
Oh-ho-ho no, no, no!

157
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,728
'Hello, dummy.'

158
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,717
'You!'

159
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,704
How could you?

160
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:07,750
For once I was happy!

161
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,736
Why couldn't you stay out of my life?

162
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:16,715
Because you owe me... dummy!

163
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,734
You left me there to rot in the can!

164
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:20,732
I-I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,765
They told me you were gone... for good.

166
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,726
Well, you'd better not ever double-cross me again

167
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,733
you little rat!

168
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,728
Ye-yes, sir.

169
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:31,743
You're the boss.

170
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,737
That's right.

171
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,737
Now, let's get the old gang back together.

172
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:40,760
I hear we have a <i>big job to do.</i>

173
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,765
Big night, Bruce.

174
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,774
Let's hope tonight's patrons step up to the plate.

175
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,781
Some of these items are worth a fortune.

176
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,775
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mayor Grange

177
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,772
but Mr. Wayne has a call.

178
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,766
Take a message, please, Alfred.

179
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,796
It is rather urgent. Ahem!

180
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:15,791
Excuse me, mayor.

181
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,799
Sure, Bruce.

182
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:24,783
How come <i>you get to be</i> the dinosaur, Mugsy?

183
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,805
You look ridiculous.

184
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:31,795
No, Rhino. You look like a smile that's been <i>kissed by a rainbow.</i>

185
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:34,796
Stop talkin' like that! And yous two

186
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,819
just stay in character, until I give the signal.

187
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:41,820
What is it, commissioner?

188
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:43,820
An anonymous tip?

189
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:46,824
Wesker's gonna hit the gala.

190
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,822
I see.

191
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:52,818
Mr. Snoots, can I have a hug?

192
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:57,846
Kid... touch me, and I will destroy you!

193
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:00,834
Mom!

194
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,838
Have a silly day!

195
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,841
Why did you have to make him cry?

196
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:07,827
The crying's just startin'!

197
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,855
Release the onion gas, boys!

198
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,879
Thud thud.

199
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:30,887
Careful! They ain't worth squat damaged!

200
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:35,886
Bash bash How'd he get the jump on us?

201
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:42,894
Bam

202
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:48,896
argh Ah!

203
00:14:53,902 --> 00:15:01,905
Boom.

204
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:04,927
Get the Bat!

205
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,890
'Not the baseball bats, you morons!'

206
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:11,931
'Those are priceless!'

207
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,939
Try whackin' the Bat with something we're not stealin'!

208
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,937
Crash.

209
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,943
'I smell a rat.'

210
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,942
Only one way the Bat could've found us so quick!

211
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,977
Someone dropped a dime on our little caper.

212
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:00,951
I-it wasn't me, boss.

213
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:02,953
Eh, me neither.

214
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,968
I know who.

215
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,954
You, you think it was me?

216
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,951
I didn't do it, honest!

217
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:15,979
Save it, stoolie! You sold us out!

218
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,972
Didn't I warn you about double-crossin' me again..

219
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,984
Dummy?

220
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,999
Please don't do this, sir! It wasn't me!

221
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,042
I knew it was you, Arnie!

222
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,014
You broke my heart.

223
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:06,047
You broke my heart!

224
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,048
Let 'er rip, boys!

225
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,050
Here it comes! Next stop... your face!

226
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,065
Help!

227
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:29,062
All aboard!

228
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:33,074
Get the Bat!

229
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,076
Argh!

230
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,070
Swish swish swish.

231
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,064
'All aboard!'

232
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,073
Oh!

233
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,068
'Help!'

234
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:00,057
Free yourself, Wesker!

235
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,099
'You don't have to let Scarface control you.'

236
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,105
I'm sorry, sir.

237
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,074
But you leave me no choice!

238
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:12,082
Will you just lie there, dummy!

239
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:14,082
Yes, sir. Sorry.

240
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:21,105
Bash thud Here comes choo-choo Chucky!

241
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:27,100
Chugga-chugga-choo-choo!

242
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:31,100
Now you pay for rattin' me out!

243
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,103
Wesker wasn't your rat.

244
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,136
'It was him.'

245
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:37,099
Mr. Snoots?

246
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:38,134
He's the rat?

247
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,133
Arrrgh!

248
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:45,123
It's true. I called the police.

249
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:48,149
Well, I'm gonna turn you inside out!

250
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,140
Bring it on!

251
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:00,161
Howdy, partner!

252
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,143
Thump.

253
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,147
'I'm gonna wipe that stupid smile off your face'

254
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,148
once and for all!

255
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:20,161
Whoa! Wo-ho! Whoa! Ha ha ha! Ah, ah!

256
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:31,173
No!

257
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:43,184
End of the line!

258
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:49,211
He was the most special guy

259
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,198
in the whole wide wonderful world!

260
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:57,181
If you're referring to Mr. Snoots..

261
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:59,220
There maybe hope for you yet.

262
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:08,206
'You planted Scarface in Wesker's apartment.'

263
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,194
Why?

264
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:13,195
I had to put my treatment to the test, Batman.

265
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:16,199
You know, to see if the criminal mind

266
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:20,204
can ever <i>really be cured.</i>

267
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:23,207
I don't approve of your methods, Professor Strange.

268
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:27,227
Says the man who dresses like a bat.

269
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,242
I'll be watching you.
