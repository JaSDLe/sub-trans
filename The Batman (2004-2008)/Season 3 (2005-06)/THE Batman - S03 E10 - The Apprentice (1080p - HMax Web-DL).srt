1
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:09,990
As mayor of Gotham city, I have many duties.

2
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:15,030
But none tastier than judging our Annual Chili Cook-Off.

3
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:21,014
Mm.

4
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:22,040
Ahh.

5
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,036
Ah! Oh! Ohh!

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,042
Hot! Too hot! Too hot!

7
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:44,048
Jo.. Joke..

8
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,037
It's Joker!

9
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,422
- Let's get out of here! - Come on!

10
00:00:56,063 --> 00:01:00,074
Fire alarm, ha-ha! Jalapeno fire-mouth!

11
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:03,054
I'll put it out!

12
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:06,086
You really should know better, Mr. Mayor.

13
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:12,083
Chili always gives you gas.

14
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,119
Beep

15
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,125
vroom

16
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,130
boom

17
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:01,140
vroom

18
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,145
clang

19
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:31,155
vroom.

20
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:33,140
Huh?

21
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:34,177
Batsy?

22
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,181
Punch, Judy.

23
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:43,182
Swish swish swish.

24
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,190
Unh!

25
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,163
Now open wide and say, "Ha."

26
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,197
Stop me if you've heard this one.

27
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,196
Should've stopped me.

28
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:15,209
'Just look at batsy and bitsy.'

29
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:18,219
The teamwork.

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,189
The footwork.

31
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:24,227
I want my own mini-me.

32
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,211
Punch, Judy!

33
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:33,214
'Eat my dust, Bats!'

34
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,225
So, what's the plan to take down Joke..

35
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:47,249
Nice to be a part of the team.

36
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:53,224
Must be nice to have someone to watch your back.

37
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,255
To mold in your own likeness.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,237
'Well, if you have a sidekick, batsy'

39
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,259
I want one, too.

40
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,227
You two don't count.

41
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,260
You're not sidekicks. You're goons!

42
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:15,243
I just know somewhere out there is a Joker Junior

43
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:19,278
just waiting for me to take him under my wing.

44
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:25,244
'Which would make the factored equation'

45
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:30,267
two times X minus eight times X minus five.

46
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,251
I rock.

47
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,288
Excellent, Barbara.

48
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,293
Smack.

49
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,297
Hilarious.

50
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,291
Donnie.

51
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:50,298
Now, who would like to solve for X?

52
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:56,284
Pff-ff-ff.

53
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,284
Oh, I-I know! I know, I know! I know!

54
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:01,314
X equals P-U!

55
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,316
Ahem-ahem.

56
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:13,306
No, Donnie. X equals one week of detention.

57
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,297
Aw, Mr. Harmes

58
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:18,306
isn't that harsh punishment for the class clown?

59
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,342
Gee, Donnie, I thought you had to be funny

60
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,327
to be the class clown.

61
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:30,312
You people don't know funny.

62
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,341
I'll just go somewhere they do.

63
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,336
- Gee, that's funny? - Pathetic.

64
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,347
And the mathematician says, "X equals P-U!"

65
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:51,372
'You stink!'

66
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:56,362
Hey! You're gonna miss the best part.

67
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,361
Prop comedy!

68
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:11,371
Thank you. I'll be here all week.

69
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,369
Kid, you have some real potential.

70
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,399
And I know funny.

71
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:20,403
Crash.

72
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,375
You're, you're..

73
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,379
A comic who only wants to make people laugh

74
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:27,377
just like you.

75
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:31,370
I'll bet no one gets your jokes, either.

76
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:34,388
Instead of laughs, I usually get detention.

77
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:37,376
See, you get sent to detention.

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,394
I get sent to the asylum. And for what?

79
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,403
Trying to bring a little joy into this miserable world?

80
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:45,399
Donnie, is it?

81
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:47,429
How would you like to learn from the best?

82
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,423
Be my, uh, apprentice?

83
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,407
Uh, a-apprentice?

84
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,409
Oh, I, I don't know, I..

85
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,434
Chew on it a while.

86
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,435
You'll see me around.

87
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,454
Tick tick tick.

88
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:24,534
Same time tomorrow, Donnie.

89
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,454
I'm sure we'll have another barrel of laughs.

90
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,471
Shh!

91
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,470
Uhh! Aa-aah! Aah!

92
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:01,462
Let me down! Let me down!

93
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:02,476
Aah! Aah! Uhh!

94
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,494
Get-get me down!

95
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:11,488
That was classic!

96
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,516
See how much fun we could have?

97
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,517
Join team Joker.

98
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,500
'It'll be a hoot.'

99
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:34,492
Thought I might find you brooding in this part of town.

100
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,514
Joker's gonna strike again.

101
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,496
The question is where.

102
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,508
Well, two heads are better than one

103
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,542
when they're on separate bodies.

104
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:50,537
Clank swish.

105
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,550
And this is where the magic happens.

106
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:01,520
My idea factory!

107
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:05,542
Contraptions, concoctions and comical confections.

108
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,534
As you can see, I've been toying

109
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,560
with quite a few whimsies.

110
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:14,565
Whoa. I'm in prop comedy heaven.

111
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,557
"Revenge is a dish best served... chili."

112
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:23,556
Eh, half-baked but slightly inspired

113
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,550
circus fire truck homage.

114
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,555
It lacked that classic Joker touch, you know what I mean?

115
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:31,568
Coming up with comedy gold week after week is tough.

116
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:34,559
Which is why it's good to get some new blood

117
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,589
in the old clown house.

118
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,602
'Look, I know you never asked for a partner'

119
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,603
but I don't wanna be freelance forever.

120
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:50,583
What's it gonna take for me to be your official sidekick?

121
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:54,599
I mean, I could be a better Batgirl if you trained me.

122
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,595
You must have a secret hideout.

123
00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:00,598
Why can't we hang out there once in a while?

124
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,615
Then it wouldn't be a secret.

125
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:13,225
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

126
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,606
Then we set off the giant dominoes..

127
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,604
And wham!

128
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:22,603
The chief gets flicked into a vat of green jelly!

129
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,614
Huh? Huh? Huh?

130
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,634
Eh, not grabbing me. What else you got?

131
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,609
Okay, the police banquet.

132
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,628
Cover the ballroom floor with mousetraps.

133
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,620
Doesn't scream "Joker."

134
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:36,624
Seal cops inside giant playing cards?

135
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,616
Uh, been there, done that.

136
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,636
Giant crossword puzzle maze!

137
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,621
Nah, too riddler.

138
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:43,664
Um..

139
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,629
Oh! Uhh! Great.

140
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:52,664
Gum on my shoe.

141
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:55,640
Gum? Shoe?

142
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:58,681
G-gumshoe! Oh! We hit the police with a giant gumball!

143
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:04,664
That could gum up the gumshoes for days!

144
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:06,665
And with the right touch

145
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:10,693
it could have that crazy crime clown flare!

146
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,691
I love it!

147
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:18,678
Construction! Wardrobe!

148
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,661
Wardrobe?

149
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,700
I can't be seen with you dressed like that.

150
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:35,709
Huh?

151
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,727
Bam

152
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,741
pow bam bam swish.

153
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,727
Your joke just fell flat.

154
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,744
Well, stand by for another, batsy.

155
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:14,730
'Knock, knock.'

156
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:16,724
Who's there?

157
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:17,729
'Prank.'

158
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,743
Prank who?

159
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,755
Prank, your new sidekick.

160
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,752
Joker has a sidekick?

161
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:37,748
Sorry to burst your bubble, batsy.

162
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:40,766
It's your time to shine, sonny boy.

163
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:45,769
Stick around, Batman.

164
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,790
Boom bam.

165
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,772
Now, Prank, remember what I taught you at the hideout.

166
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:56,756
He's been to Joker's hideout?

167
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,781
Why don't we have that kind of relationship?

168
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:02,788
Pow bam

169
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,795
pow.

170
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:17,818
Chew on this.

171
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:19,821
Bam.

172
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:29,814
Show me what you got, clown boy.

173
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,815
Ohh, gross.

174
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:39,809
That laugh.

175
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,800
No way.

176
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:43,808
Huh?

177
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:44,840
Bam.

178
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:50,840
The best punchline is the one you don't see coming.

179
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:58,849
Pow

180
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:04,867
puff.

181
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,863
Looksie, Batman!

182
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:16,860
My sidekick is about to make your sidekick go splat!

183
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,903
Launch away, Prank!

184
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,878
Whoa, w-wait a minute.

185
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:47,910
If I do that, she'll..

186
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,906
That's right. It'll be hee-haw-larious!

187
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:54,896
Um..

188
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,902
I-I'm not sure I get it.

189
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:06,905
You yank lever, gumball go boom.

190
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,894
Goo everywhere, including Batgirl.

191
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,910
We laugh, they cry, what's not to get?

192
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,909
- Uh.. - Comedy is timing, Prank.

193
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:17,926
'So let her rip!'

194
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:30,916
boom crack crack crack

195
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,921
I wanted to make people laugh

196
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:33,949
not hurt them.

197
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,927
Sounds like you and I need to take a little time-out.

198
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,950
Oops! Almost forgot.

199
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,956
Pow swish swish

200
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,973
clank bam whoosh.

201
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,947
Donnie needs our help.

202
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,953
Donnie?

203
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,985
Prank's no criminal. He's a classmate.

204
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:08,951
Long story.

205
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:09,963
Hopefully with a happy ending.

206
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,958
We'll need to pick up Joker's trail.

207
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:13,958
Covered. Popped a tracer on him.

208
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:16,968
Beep beep beep Property of Gotham PD?

209
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,959
I borrowed dad's.

210
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:20,979
When you don't have access to the official Bat arsenal

211
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:22,989
you improvise.

212
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:29,976
We have lots to do if you expect to graduate from class clown

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,970
'to crime clown.'

214
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:33,975
That's the thing, Joker.

215
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:36,005
I'm thinking maybe I'm not cut out for this.

216
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,021
- I blame myself. - You do?

217
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,986
I should've known that a costume and make-up wouldn't be enough.

218
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,001
No. To live the part, you have to <i>be the part.</i>

219
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,997
Wha.. What does that mean?

220
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:53,018
Come on. I'll show you.

221
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:06,020
Uh, where are we going?

222
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:10,051
To a happy place for only special boys to see.

223
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,039
A place where crazy crime clowns are born.

224
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,026
Have a good look at my past

225
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,056
and your future.

226
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:25,067
No!

227
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,039
That's right, Pranky.

228
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,056
It's perma-clown time!

229
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,062
Blub blub blub.

230
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,053
It was in this very chemical concoction

231
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:44,056
that I collected my clowny complexion.

232
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,059
And now it's your turn.

233
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,084
Aah!

234
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:57,075
Why so nervous?

235
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,096
I mean, look how I turned out.

236
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,107
Let the kid go, Joker.

237
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm trying to!

238
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,107
Huh?

239
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,116
Grab your ducky. It's bath time.

240
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,123
Pow

241
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,133
swish swish clank clank clank.

242
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,120
Can't hang on!

243
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:49,132
I got you.

244
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:57,143
Ah! Not helping!

245
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,151
Pow.

246
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:09,151
'Batman!'

247
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,172
Ya-aa-ah!

248
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:31,176
Huh?

249
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:43,166
You were right, Joker.

250
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,203
The best punchline is the one you don't see coming.

251
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,211
You know... our relationship's looking better all the time.
