1
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,000
The next lot up for auction.

2
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:13,998
A mid-19th century gentleman's bumbershoot.

3
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:19,007
'Featuring unique engraved ivory handle with jewel inlay.'

4
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:23,009
Bidding begins at 50,000. Do I hear 50?'

5
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,004
'Fifty. Do I hear 55?'

6
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:27,007
Fifty-five. Sixty?

7
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,020
'Sixty. Sixty-five? Sixty-five. Seventy?'

8
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:33,017
Seventy. Do I hear 75?

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,016
'Seventy-five.'

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,024
Going once. Going twice.

11
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:41,041
'A buck 50. Ha, ha, ha!'

12
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,048
Sold?

13
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:59,062
Never can have too many umbrellas.

14
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:06,068
Now if you'll excuse me, I am going once, going tw.. Huh?

15
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:11,082
- Going back to Arkham. - Says you.

16
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:25,098
Never get between a collector and his prize, Batman.

17
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:32,084
What do you know?

18
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:35,117
A sunshade to keep me cool.

19
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,120
Freeze?

20
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,184
Have an ice evening.

21
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,181
What? I stole it first.

22
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,180
Penguin's interest is obvious

23
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:12,215
but umbrellas don't seem to complement your winter wear.

24
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,211
This one does.

25
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,219
Whirrrshhhhhhhcccchhh

26
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:46,242
thud.

27
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,250
It's mine.

28
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,248
Thud

29
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,248
bang.

30
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,254
Oh.

31
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,265
Shuush.

32
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,275
Why isn't it here?

33
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:01,323
Alfie. Alfie Pennyworth. Well, don't you recognize me?

34
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,286
Ewan? Ewan Fripp?

35
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,327
In the flesh. You're looking fit, if a bit thin on top.

36
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,337
You've done well for yourself, old chum.

37
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:23,318
This is the Wayne family mansion.

38
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:25,346
I am their butler.

39
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,316
Just winding you up, Alfie.

40
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,322
So how long has it been?

41
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,328
Thirty-six years.

42
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:36,327
What brings you to Gotham City, Ewan?

43
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:38,335
Historic artifacts is my game.

44
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:41,325
And since I was out this way, I thought.

45
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,339
"Why not look up my old school chum?"

46
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:45,337
How very considerate.

47
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,328
I had come to find out

48
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:49,371
one of the only known copies of a very rare book.

49
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,349
I need for my research is said to be

50
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:55,333
in the Wayne collection.

51
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,369
How very coincidental.

52
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:22,377
The code.

53
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,407
Three numbers.

54
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,380
"Four.

55
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,411
"Twenty-two.

56
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,413
Seventeen."

57
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:36,382
Map 17.

58
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:38,391
"Level four."

59
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,389
Tunnel 22.

60
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,418
Good show.

61
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,401
You must be Ewan.

62
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,433
It's great to meet an old friend of Alfred's.

63
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,395
Many thanks for loaning your library, Mr. Wayne.

64
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,402
Alas, I must really be off.

65
00:06:57,426 --> 00:07:01,418
A shame you can't join me on my Gotham adventure, old chum.

66
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:03,422
Well, I don't want it to be another 36 years

67
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:05,420
before you two get this opportunity.

68
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:08,426
Go ahead, Alfred. Take the afternoon off.

69
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,446
Yes, do. For old times' sake.

70
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,417
I say Ewan

71
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:23,452
your research takes you to some rather grimy grottos.

72
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:28,429
You pilfered that page from Master Bruce.

73
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:32,434
Nearly through, old chum. Promise to return it.

74
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,443
Now look here, Ewan, I demand to know

75
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:38,444
just what kind of artifacts we're looking for.

76
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:39,457
Treasure.

77
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:44,447
Stolen from the royal palace over a hundred years ago.

78
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:47,472
Her majesty's royal palace?

79
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:53,474
Stolen by whom?

80
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:57,456
I know that crest.

81
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,482
The Cobblepots.

82
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,514
A numeric code. But for what?

83
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:22,510
'For a map of Gotham's old utility tunnels.'

84
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:34,510
A Chesterfield Cobblepot stole the treasure in 1879

85
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:36,510
and smuggled it here to Gotham.

86
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:39,510
I can't help but wonder if a certain Cobblepot

87
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,541
descendant knows about this.

88
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,544
Well, wonder no more, Pennyworth.

89
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,546
- Blast. - Blast.

90
00:08:57,544 --> 00:09:00,525
Thanks for leading me to my family fortune, gents.

91
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,534
But what are you doing here, Pennyworth?

92
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:05,532
Seeing to it that stolen property

93
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:07,536
is returned to queen and country.

94
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,534
'Stolen-shmolen.'

95
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,567
'It's in the family now, it's mine.'

96
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,568
'A missing page?'

97
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:26,589
Ewan.

98
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:32,571
Alfred.

99
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:37,561
I know Wayne's butler. What's your game?

100
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,566
Historic artifacts is my game, Mr. Cobblepot.

101
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,571
In fact, I regret to inform you

102
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:46,592
that you shan't be able to open the vault without my help.

103
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:52,570
Think I don't know how to operate a family heirloom?

104
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,617
It's not just an umbrella.

105
00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:58,603
It's a key.

106
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,625
Show me the money.

107
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,626
What? Where is it?

108
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,632
Bah! Junk.

109
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,621
There's supposed to be gold. Silver. Jewels.

110
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:25,636
There's gotta be a secret compartment. Huh?

111
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,610
No.

112
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,631
- Jolly good. - Think that was good, Alfie?

113
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:34,654
Get a load of this.

114
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:58,663
So, he thinks he's Mr. Fancy. You know what, I'll get him!

115
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:04,643
The lighthouse, I see.

116
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,685
- Brilliant. - My word. What does it mean?

117
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:15,671
We'd better split up. Here, take this.

118
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:17,669
What? Why?

119
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,679
Come back.

120
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,700
A left at the next junction, then straight on to.. Ahh!

121
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,692
'Where is it?'

122
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:36,682
Don't have the umbrella.

123
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,691
You may want to pursue the other chap.

124
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:40,683
The butler?

125
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:45,722
I somehow doubt historic artifacts are his game.

126
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,728
Batman?

127
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,742
Another treasure hunter?

128
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,721
Would you believe, a butler?

129
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:12,713
Lead me to the treasure, butler.

130
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:15,725
Really, I know nothing about it.

131
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,749
I think you do.

132
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:22,760
Well, there was some mention of a lighthouse.

133
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,739
If this symbol represents

134
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:40,754
the lighthouse we are in

135
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:43,782
this one must be just over yonder.

136
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:47,759
There it is.

137
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,756
'The old cathedral.'

138
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,754
The lines must intersect at the treasure's location.

139
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,790
But how would we ever...?

140
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,789
X marks the spot, indeed.

141
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:19,804
In the middle of the harbor?

142
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:25,828
Thanks for marking the spot, Freezie.

143
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,831
It shall be the spot of your watery grave, Penguin.

144
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,802
'Chesterfield Cobblepot'

145
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,799
deliberately sank his schooner

146
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:39,801
rather than be captured by American authorities.

147
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,816
And used physical landmarks to fix its location

148
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,814
for later retrieval.

149
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,812
Chesty was a clever old bird.

150
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,816
A shame that walking snowman

151
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,830
is too late to stop me from reclaiming my fortune.

152
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:54,843
Ha! Oh.

153
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,856
Oh, dear, he may never find me.

154
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,878
I'm not much of a swimmer.

155
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,861
No one gets between me and my fortune.

156
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,880
No one.

157
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:04,885
A little help, Ewan.

158
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,916
What are you up to?

159
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,939
Ah. Jolly good.

160
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:28,914
You alright?

161
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:29,919
That should teach you to give me

162
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:30,951
the day off.

163
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,943
You'll be safe here.

164
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,933
But the treasure, Batman, is down there

165
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,963
and I must recover it.

166
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:49,948
For historical purposes, of course.

167
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:54,947
Are you daft? It is dangerous down there.

168
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,935
Did you not hear the fellow in the bat costume

169
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,978
instruct us to stay behind?

170
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:14,960
'Huh?'

171
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,986
'The treasure ship.'

172
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,991
Wow.

173
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:27,986
Flawless.

174
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,997
The Tudor Royal Diamonds.

175
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:35,000
A legend made real.

176
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,999
'Hey, ice pop.'

177
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:49,013
I'll never share my little nest egg.

178
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,019
Oh, mama.

179
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,018
Pretty. Pretty, pretty.

180
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:08,013
Your demise may warm even my heart.

181
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:11,040
Why won't you stay melted?

182
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,033
The diamonds are mine.

183
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:24,065
No. They're all mine. Mine. Mine.

184
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,050
Thought you two could use a referee.

185
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,052
Go on then..

186
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:38,070
Bring it.

187
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,092
What are you doing?

188
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,512
Don't tell me you don't help yourself

189
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,074
to the master's silver now and then, old chum?

190
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,068
I most certainly do not.

191
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:02,074
Well, it might do you some good.

192
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:05,104
And a trouncing might do you some good.

193
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,086
If the ice continues to melt at this rate

194
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,085
the bay could collapse in us with the force of a tidal wave.

195
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,087
I've come this far, Bat

196
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,116
that's a chance I'm willing to take.

197
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,123
We leave or we drown.

198
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,137
You like treasure, Freezie?

199
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,135
Then you'll love this necklace.

200
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:54,156
No fair.

201
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,148
Almost there.

202
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,174
Maybe we should split the treasure.

203
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,175
You and your stupid ice.

204
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:51,177
It's all your fault.

205
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,206
Oh, shut up.

206
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:02,185
The treasure is scattered to the depths.

207
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,190
As good as lost.

208
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:07,228
Sometimes it is best to let what's past be past.

209
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,189
And I suggest that the same apply to you and me

210
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,224
'old chum.'
