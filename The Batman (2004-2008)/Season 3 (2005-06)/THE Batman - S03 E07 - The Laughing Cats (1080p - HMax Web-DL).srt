1
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:18,036
'So someone snatched an endangered Black Leopard.'

2
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:24,014
Since I bet that cat's worth some serious scratch..

3
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:27,019
I'd say that narrows our list of suspects considerably

4
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:30,016
to, oh, lemme count, one.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,019
This wasn't Catwoman.

6
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:35,020
Really? This totally purrs Catwoman.

7
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,029
Just because she's a cat burglar

8
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:40,023
doesn't mean she's a cat thief.

9
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:42,027
'Look at the number of footprints.'

10
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:45,027
This wasn't a solo job.

11
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:47,044
Hey, you ought to consider doing this for a living.

12
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:49,042
I also doubt it's a coincidence

13
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:52,031
that the only other leopard of its kind in captivity

14
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,044
arrives in Gotham tomorrow

15
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:56,074
as part of Amazing Leslie's Animal Extravaganza.

16
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:18,099
So, when do I get to say, "Told you so?"

17
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:34,137
It's okay, pretty kitty.

18
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,169
Aw.

19
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,157
Now, handsome, this isn't what it looks like.

20
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,146
Oh, lemme guess it involves space aliens

21
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,148
and a road trip to Fresno?

22
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,169
Hm, couldn't find a babysitter?

23
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:53,161
Good one, where's the other leopard?

24
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:55,169
I didn't steal the other leopard

25
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:58,180
but I am going to steal this one.

26
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,203
Since you two missed the show tonight..

27
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:14,203
'...here's your chance to catch The Wrestling Gorillas.'

28
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,219
Sorry, fellas.

29
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,220
Whoosh.

30
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,205
Meow.

31
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,229
Kitty doesn't have time to play, little one.

32
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:48,236
Thud thud.

33
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:02,253
- Oh. Not bad. - Just wait till I start trying.

34
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,251
Ah!

35
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,282
'Playtime's over.'

36
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,300
Come on, precious.

37
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,299
Hello... kitties.

38
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,302
Joker?

39
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,301
Ugh!

40
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,310
Twisted dreams.

41
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:05,304
Well, looks like we're back to my theory.

42
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:09,302
- Catwoman stole the leopards. - I'm not so sure.

43
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,310
I found a strand of hair.

44
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,301
Okay.

45
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:14,332
It's green.

46
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,317
I never pegged you for a cat person, Joker.

47
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:31,310
Me? I despise the mangy beasts.

48
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,317
You see, I snatched these kittens

49
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,330
for a recent business acquaintance.

50
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:39,332
Mr. Killgore Steed.

51
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,325
<i>The Killgore Steed?</i>

52
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,339
That creep hunts endangered species on his private island.

53
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:47,330
Well, in exchange for those leopards.

54
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:51,365
Killgore has promised to deliver me the real cat's meow!

55
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:56,347
You're lucky I'm tied up.

56
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,342
Bringing us back to the subject

57
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:02,353
I've always been told there's more than one way

58
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,372
to skin a cat.

59
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:07,382
Whoosh.

60
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,354
A true classic!

61
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:17,363
'Of course, I tweaked the punchline a smidge.'

62
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:18,748
'Modern audiences like their humor'

63
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,541
'with a little more... bite!'

64
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:36,406
And here I thought curiosity killed the cat.

65
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,408
Crash.

66
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,396
My heroes.

67
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,423
Clank vroom vroom vroom

68
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,435
crash

69
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,421
thud thud thud.

70
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:03,443
Help her.

71
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,432
Bang

72
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:15,447
bang bang crash.

73
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:18,452
Come on, boys.

74
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,453
The cats.

75
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,476
Come on, we need to go get those cats.

76
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,434
Uh, we?

77
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,455
You're after the pound, Catwoman.

78
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,446
Let's not be hasty, handsome.

79
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,454
Do you know where Joker's headed?

80
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:45,451
Hm, didn't think so.

81
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:46,462
Well, I do..

82
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:49,457
And if we don't hunt them down toot sweet

83
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,454
someone else will.

84
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,484
You're <i>not falling for this?</i>

85
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:57,477
Lead the way.

86
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,464
Catwoman leading the way

87
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:03,488
isn't that like calling in Penguin for backup?

88
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,512
'Land, ho! Ho-ho-ho.'

89
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:18,511
Let's collect my booty, boys.

90
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:23,483
For years, Killgore Steed's been getting his kicks

91
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:25,498
by hunting the rarest of the rare.

92
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,504
Wild animals belong in the wild.

93
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:30,505
Not in cages, not wearing silly costumes

94
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:33,497
and especially not being hunted.

95
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:35,501
You're pretty hardcore about this.

96
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:38,506
Hm, animals are what make me purr.

97
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,505
When you're not hunting jewels.

98
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,544
Always the sourpuss.

99
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,505
I bet he never lets you drive.

100
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,533
He barely lets me sidekick.

101
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:02,554
Knock, knock.

102
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,537
Evening, Joker.

103
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,559
You're supposed to say "Who's there?"

104
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,554
You've done well.

105
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:22,548
Hm. Manly decor.

106
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,545
My trophies.

107
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:28,549
Each and every one imported to my island.

108
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:32,579
So I can hunt them within my... private safari.

109
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:37,572
Ah!

110
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:40,598
'What an amazing maze!'

111
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:46,598
Adds to the thrill of the hunt, it would seem.

112
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,613
In you go, kitties.

113
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,621
I believe you have something for me.

114
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:18,637
Ahh!

115
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,611
They're gorgeous.

116
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:27,632
Albino Hyenas, the rarest of the rare.

117
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,630
Think they look like their pa?

118
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:35,628
Ooh! I-I wanna be sure the pups have a good sense of humor.

119
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:38,625
And how do you determine that?

120
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,662
With a joke, of course.

121
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:01,682
They know funny.

122
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,671
I know your heart was set on the cat hunt..

123
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:17,695
But would it upset you much if it was a cat and two bats?

124
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,671
If they've done anything to those cats

125
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:32,688
I will scratch their eyes out.

126
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,716
You almost sound like you're going hero on us.

127
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,691
Hey, for the right cause.

128
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,680
You should give it a try, you might actually

129
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:40,692
make a good-good guy.

130
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,688
I'd need a sidekick.

131
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:44,684
And with a few costume adjustments

132
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,718
you're not too far from being a Catgirl.

133
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,732
Killgore's compound is supposed to be littered with traps.

134
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:11,754
'Now hold those poses.'

135
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,719
That's how I want you to look

136
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:17,739
when you're stuffed and mounted on my wall.

137
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:28,770
- What's your game, Joker? - The three of you, of course.

138
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,735
But before we play, there are few simple ground rules.

139
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,744
'Nuh-ah-ah!'

140
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,779
Rule number one, no gadgets

141
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,739
or the pretty kitties take the express train..

142
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:44,768
'...from endangered to extinct.'

143
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:46,783
No.

144
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:54,784
Clank

145
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,790
clang clang clang.

146
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:07,776
My own Bat and Cat toys.

147
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,767
Why are you doing this?

148
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,787
'Cause my growing boys here need fresh meat

149
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:15,781
'and plenty of it.'

150
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:19,822
'Ooh, lookie, a rare poisonous arachnid wants to join the fun.'

151
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,805
Well, the more the merrier.

152
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:26,810
'Off you go, Legs McGee.'

153
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,827
'Now, on your mark!'

154
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:37,832
'Get set..'

155
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,827
Run for your lives.

156
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,852
Crash.

157
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:18,877
Just a little something to help keep our eyes' on the prizes.

158
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,889
Moss, too slippery to climb.

159
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:16,938
Thud

160
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:19,927
bam

161
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,936
thud

162
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:43,951
screech.

163
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,936
Oh, boys!

164
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,967
Dinner is served.

165
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:54,954
Can't bear to look.

166
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:58,940
Come on.

167
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:00,964
Cut it out, that tickles.

168
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:05,946
Boys! Sic her! She's a cat!

169
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,947
What kind of crazy canines are you?

170
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:10,948
Sorry to burst your balloon, Joker

171
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:14,957
but hyenas are more closely related to cats than dogs.

172
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:17,967
Oh, and, by the way, they're laughing <i>at you.</i>

173
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:21,002
Well, I'm gonna have the last laugh.

174
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:23,992
Hyah!

175
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:35,000
Whoosh whoosh whoosh

176
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,028
bam.

177
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,044
Time to find the others.

178
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,041
Ugh!

179
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,057
Bang.

180
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:25,066
Huh!

181
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,051
'Roadmap to Catwoman.'

182
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,057
Hyah!

183
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:45,086
Joker-brand Catnip will give you a Cheshire grin.

184
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,079
Not if I can help it.

185
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,092
You busted my boutonniere.

186
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,100
You're lucky that's all.

187
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,095
Shut up.

188
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,090
Aah... ha!

189
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,113
Take this.

190
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,110
Find the cats.

191
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:30,110
'Biometrics, Joker.'

192
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:35,101
What are you, eh, prattling on about, Batsy?

193
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,097
It only opens for me.

194
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,139
Then I'll just belt you one!

195
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,140
Bam.

196
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:52,145
Momma's here, babies.

197
00:18:57,148 --> 00:19:00,138
Looks like "Smiley" could use some joker gas antidote.

198
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:03,140
Let's get these leopards back to their owners.

199
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:06,150
Oh, yeah, about that.

200
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,152
Smack.

201
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,130
Ow, hey!

202
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,145
Sorry, kid, but I've taken a shine to these darlings.

203
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,142
And seriously, if you ever decide to make the switch

204
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,139
from sidekick to partner-in-crime..

205
00:19:21,163 --> 00:19:23,164
I'll be sure to look you up.

206
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:37,167
Uh! Here, kitty-kitty, come on!

207
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:39,173
Ugh! What are you waiting for? Come on!

208
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:44,169
You of all people should know cats don't like water.

209
00:19:44,193 --> 00:19:46,191
Or being caged.

210
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,198
Always the sourpuss.

211
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:11,190
Can't believe I thought there was some good in her.

212
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,199
I should've warned you about her tricks.

213
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:15,192
She's a sly one.

214
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:18,206
I guess leopards don't change their spots.

215
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,217
You know, it was your instinct

216
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:22,216
not to trust her in the first place.

217
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,215
That mean you'll keep me?

218
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:28,243
You make a better Batgirl than a Catgirl.

219
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:34,235
Good... never was much of a cat person anyway.
