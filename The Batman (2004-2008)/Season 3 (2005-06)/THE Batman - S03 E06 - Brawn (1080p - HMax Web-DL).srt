1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,006
'Ladies and gentlemen'

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,014
give it up for Man Mountain Malloy

3
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:22,036
'the strongest man in Gotham City!'

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,043
Ho-hum.

5
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,075
You know clowns are evil, don't you?

6
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,081
Ooh, tough guy.

7
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:10,070
Especially that clown.

8
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:14,059
If you think he's buff, folks

9
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,094
get a load of me.

10
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,089
Hide your families, Gotham

11
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:42,093
'cause when joker goes jumbo

12
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:45,125
he'll snap your twigs!

13
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,126
Whoa. Big.

14
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:58,135
Batgirl.

15
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,135
You're way dinkier than I expected.

16
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,115
Being a criminal genius

17
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,118
just doesn't cut it these days.

18
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:14,152
You need brawn to compliment the brains.

19
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:30,164
I think I better join a gym.

20
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:40,210
'Now we know who stole bane's power infusion module'

21
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:44,210
'from Gotham PD's evidence lock-up.'

22
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:46,215
A crazy crime clown running amuck

23
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,208
with the strength from Bane!

24
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:50,221
But what did he steal at a circus?

25
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:52,210
The box office.

26
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,212
That seems rather small potatoes

27
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:56,217
for a giant joker.

28
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,257
The entire box office.

29
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,262
No doubt a warm-up for a bigger workout.

30
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,241
'I need to bulk up.'

31
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:12,230
I can't let the Batman have a weakling for backup.

32
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:15,242
Ninety-nine, ugh, one hundred..

33
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,259
Oh.

34
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,246
Twenty-thousand more reps

35
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,268
and I'll have "Iron Pumping Muscles Of Steel."

36
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,267
Barb, are you ready for..

37
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,261
'...school?'

38
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:35,265
Uh, did I mention I'm taking a new elective, pop?

39
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:38,256
Competitive body building.

40
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,292
That's my girl.

41
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:46,309
Thank you all for joining us this morning.

42
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,279
'To symbolize Gotham City's'

43
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:51,281
'prominent place in the global community'

44
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:55,282
we unveil our new landmark.

45
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,310
The Gotham Globe!

46
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,297
'Gold-plated!'

47
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:08,316
As valuable as it is heavy, I bet.

48
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,308
Don't bother wrapping it.

49
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:15,337
I'll take this little bauble as is.

50
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:28,309
Today Gotham..

51
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,344
Tomorrow the world.

52
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:40,362
- Bye, sweetie. Be good. - Define good.

53
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:46,362
Gordon. Joker walked away with it?

54
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,335
I'm on my way.

55
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,362
You go, pop.

56
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:59,353
Round two with Joker.

57
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:03,376
Hmm! Pull it together, Barb. The bat needs you.

58
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,393
Thanks, Alfred.

59
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,366
Early start. Haven't had my coffee.

60
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,392
But Joker's already had his protein shake.

61
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:44,419
Huh?

62
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,391
Put down the globe!

63
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:52,411
It's all yours, officer.

64
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:54,434
Have a ball!

65
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:15,421
Hey, I got a fab new figure

66
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:19,425
and you got a fab new Batmobile.

67
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,462
Show and tell's over, Joker.

68
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:29,469
Whoo!

69
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:55,492
Um, ouch.

70
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:27,491
You only have yourself to blame for me, Batsey.

71
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:30,506
We've always taken turns outsmarting each other

72
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,535
but you had the muscle

73
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,531
so I thought I'd stack the odds in my favor.

74
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,521
Back for more, tiny?

75
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,517
Um, bring it on?

76
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,521
Well, Jim, that girl didn't score very high in that round.

77
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:53,540
Let's see if joker can top her in the discus throw.

78
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:57,558
Whoa!

79
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,548
Joker takes the gold!

80
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:08,537
Plan. You hit clown boy high, I hit him low.

81
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:09,543
He's out of your league.

82
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,540
I've been working out, you know.

83
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,551
For your own safety, stay back.

84
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:17,570
- Oh! - Hey! Who's up for dodge ball?

85
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:24,579
Up here if you need me.

86
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,574
Welcome to my world, Bats!

87
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:44,593
And Planet Joker is a world of hurt.

88
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,585
'Heads up!'

89
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:56,606
Look out!

90
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,615
Bye!

91
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,635
Whew! Need me yet?

92
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,642
- 'Sir?' - I'll need more backup.

93
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,660
Prepare for special delivery.

94
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,670
Batman.

95
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,647
Not good.

96
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:09,648
Next up, Jim, we have a new sporting event!

97
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:11,690
The Batmobile Toss!

98
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,698
Where do you think you're going?

99
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:55,704
I'm not through with you, weakling.

100
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, if Batman can't beat super clown, how can I?

101
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,724
Whoa.

102
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,743
A Bat Robot?

103
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:17,742
Or... a muscle suit.

104
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,739
I won't ask again, Batsey.

105
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,767
Hand over your milk money.

106
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,774
Ooh, Batgirl, you stepped up to heavyweight class!

107
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:48,784
'Here goes nothin'.'

108
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,765
Yes!

109
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,788
How many rounds can you go with Sugar Ray Joker?

110
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:00,801
Let's find out.

111
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:10,804
'Uh-oh. Retro thrusters?'

112
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:16,797
Whoa!

113
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:27,828
You're a klutz, tiny.

114
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:36,816
Okay. Where's the tutorial on this thing?

115
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:54,852
She didn't.

116
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,850
'His weak spot.'

117
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:09,871
Whoopsie!

118
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,881
Priceless!

119
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:31,859
'With shtick like that, Batgal'

120
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:34,883
you may have a future in comedy!

121
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,857
Which is more than I can say for the Batman!

122
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,884
'I predict he doesn't have a future at all.'

123
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,902
Ta-ta, tiny!

124
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:12,933
Great. I can't get up, and I can't eject.

125
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,939
I had to land on the escape hatch.

126
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,916
Batman needs my help.

127
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,936
Think, Barbara.

128
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,928
Think outside the box.

129
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:38,918
Glad I took gymnastics.

130
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,919
I'll get the hang of this muscle suit.

131
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:44,953
'At least it's gonna lead me straight to Batman.'

132
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,969
'Wakey, wakey, Batsey-watsey.'

133
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,946
Can't let you sleep through your own demise, you know?

134
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,943
'Hope you like carnival games.'

135
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,985
Allow me to demonstrate.

136
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,966
Get the picture?

137
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,971
With you gone, Batsey, there'll be no one to stop me

138
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,991
from kicking sand in Gotham's face.

139
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,006
- You forget about Batgirl. - That pipsqueak?

140
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:25,969
If she stands in my way

141
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:28,989
I'll just scrape her off my shoe.

142
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:33,015
Now time to ring your bell.

143
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:44,020
Mama's boy? Just warming up.

144
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,026
Okay. Now I'm pumped.

145
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:01,041
Huh?

146
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:05,019
You're going down, clown.

147
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,038
You again?

148
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:14,034
Good girl.

149
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,046
Huh?

150
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:40,059
Whoa. Cheap shot.

151
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:45,067
Oh, no.

152
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,092
Batman?

153
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,092
Ugh!

154
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,092
Huh?

155
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:18,079
Batarangs? Uh, tried that. Didn't hurt him.

156
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:22,088
'Wait. Batman's aiming for Joker's fuel pump.'

157
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:25,113
He's using brain to beat brawn.

158
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,101
Sorry, Batsey.

159
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,139
But only the strong survive.

160
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,141
Pardon me, but a tin can is just begging to be opened.

161
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,157
I'm tiny, Joker.

162
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:21,173
You can't reach me.

163
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,179
Ugh! Oh!

164
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,175
No!

165
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:46,196
I'm still bigger than you.

166
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:51,206
But not me, bully.

167
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,189
Look what I found.

168
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,188
Smart move there.

169
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,196
Muscles aren't everything.

170
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,195
Sometimes brains are better than brawn.
