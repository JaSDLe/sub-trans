1
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,999
And now, an update on tonight's election

2
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:12,002
as Gotham's Mayor Grange defends his post

3
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:14,008
against billionaire technologies mogul.

4
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:15,998
Maximillian Zeus

5
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:20,008
'who earlier in the campaign, appeared poised to win.'

6
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:23,011
You might say the classics inspire me.

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:26,006
After all, the Greeks and the Romans proved

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,029
that great societies rise through strong leadership.

9
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,024
'But despite his popularity'

10
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:36,015
'Zeus began losing support when his campaign unveiled'

11
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,019
'some unusual ideas.'

12
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,084
I shall remodel our city's

13
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,026
ineffectual police department

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,037
after my own private security force

15
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,070
of gladiators.

16
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,038
Glad I didn't vote for him.

17
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:52,047
You'd be sharp, looking all Spartacus, pop.

18
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:55,039
With nearly all the votes tallied, Mayor Grange

19
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:58,047
is guaranteed a resounding victory tonight.

20
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:02,049
And things are quiet at Zeus' corporate headquarters.

21
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:06,059
I'm Bruce Wayne, and while Zeus practices his concession speech

22
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,052
I'd like to introduce my friend

23
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,060
and your mayor for another four years.

24
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,079
'Marion Grange.'

25
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:15,097
Woo-hoo!

26
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,104
Thank you, Bruce.

27
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,063
- Citizens of Gotham... - 'Citizens of Gotham.'

28
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,073
Tonight's results, while disappointing

29
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,070
do not surprise me.

30
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:33,073
But I cannot allow this beloved metropolis to crumble

31
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:36,114
like so many great civilizations past.

32
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:44,127
'Thus I, Maximillian Zeus'

33
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,104
'shall rule over Gotham'

34
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:49,114
'from New Olympus!'

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,136
beep beep

36
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,099
vroom.

37
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:02,117
So that we may better venture together into the future.

38
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:06,131
'I shall erase the mistakes of the past.'

39
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,152
Barb, get out of here.

40
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:17,123
Now watch as your City Hall crumbles

41
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:19,121
'swift as lightning.'

42
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:21,147
zap zap

43
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:47,190
beep beep

44
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,196
boom

45
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:12,212
vroom.

46
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:42,207
He destroyed City Hall. What are we supposed to do now?

47
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:44,235
Time to slip into my jammies.

48
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:52,224
Citizens, if you wish to avoid

49
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,225
further demonstrations of might

50
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:57,259
you shall comply with the following decrees.

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,262
'First, should any police be sighted'

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,252
'I shall incinerate a populated monument.'

53
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,241
'Second, all air traffic is to cease'

54
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:11,233
'effective immediately.'

55
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:14,237
'Including bats.'

56
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,265
zap zap zap

57
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,278
swish.

58
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,271
Okay, so where's the Bat?

59
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:39,257
'I do hope you have a strategy, sir.'

60
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,274
I'm gonna have to meet Zeus..

61
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:44,284
On his turf.

62
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:53,273
'There he is.'

63
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:55,307
'Uh, where is he going?'

64
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:59,281
I'm out of the loop again.

65
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:01,314
Lucky for him, I'm in position.

66
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:07,325
Now boarding, evil fortress of destruction.

67
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,314
Lastly, for now

68
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:25,305
Gotham shall dedicate the former site of your City Hall

69
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,317
to the new age

70
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:30,325
by erecting a temple in my honor.

71
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,355
The man wants to be worshipped?

72
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,323
If I had the Bat's cell number

73
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:43,331
I could let him know I'm up here..

74
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,362
What?

75
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:02,385
'Gunnery crew, prepare the thunderstorm.'

76
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,366
I don't think Zeus is talking about the weather.

77
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,361
The police can't help us. What are we gonna do, Jim?

78
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,363
Only thing we can. We wait for the Bat.

79
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,354
So he can do what?

80
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:19,369
Knock down that flying battleship with his boomerang?

81
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:21,366
Batarang.

82
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,368
With all due respect to the Dark Knight

83
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,379
he's only one man.

84
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,399
Zeus vaporized City Hall.

85
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:46,418
Batwave link booted.

86
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:51,425
Dual EXP Power Cores activated.

87
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:56,394
Thrusters standing by.

88
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:58,432
The Batwing is ready for takeoff.

89
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:04,406
Thankfully, Zeus is not the <i>only billionaire in Gotham</i>

90
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,430
to have built a flying machine.

91
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,422
'Gotham is in a state of panic.'

92
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:19,461
'Citizens are evacuating in droves.'

93
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,436
That must be the power core.

94
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Oh, if I only knew how to shut it down.

95
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,487
Time to steal Maxie's thunder.

96
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:54,497
Honk honk honk.

97
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:09,471
'Target locked. Gotham Bay Bridge.'

98
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,476
We must burn a few bridges

99
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,493
if we are to keep our subjects contained.

100
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,484
Ignite thunderstorm.

101
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:20,491
'Twenty seconds to full charge. Nineteen.'

102
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,524
Well, I hope this one's important.

103
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,483
No.

104
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,493
- 'Sixteen.' - Guess not.

105
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,494
'Fifteen. Fourteen.'

106
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:29,523
- Lucky number three? - 'Thirteen.'

107
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,494
We've lost power?

108
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,498
Only to the countdown mechanism.

109
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:39,532
Thunderstorm continues to charge.

110
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,550
It's still powering up?

111
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,533
I'm usually a whole lot better at breaking things.

112
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,559
'Charge nearing completion, sir.'

113
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,562
beep beep beep.

114
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,561
Engine room.

115
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,588
'Provide immediate status.'

116
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,579
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,554
Master bolt transducer charged and operational.

118
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:36,558
'Then check all other system functions.'

119
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,568
'It would seem we have gremlins.'

120
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,579
That would be me.

121
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:45,593
- Airspace violated, sir. - What? By whom?

122
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,611
The Batman.

123
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,603
Missile systems on.

124
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,605
Target locked.

125
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:07,613
Swish swish Defense systems activated.

126
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:17,623
Boom boom zap zap zap.

127
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:35,636
The Bat's got a new set of wings.

128
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,623
Way to keep me in the loop.

129
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,634
Sir, he's neutralized our arms.

130
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:43,644
Then release the Harpies.

131
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:09,657
We've locked onto his radio frequency.

132
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:14,668
Batman. Surely you are familiar with the myth of Icarus?

133
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:19,659
Of how he flew too close to the sun..

134
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:22,668
And burned his wings.

135
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,694
Zap.

136
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,671
'I'm hit.'

137
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,687
crackle No.

138
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:35,683
Come on, the Bat needs you.

139
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:36,718
'I don't believe it.'

140
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,702
There must be dozens of unpatched cables.

141
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,725
Glad everybody's on break.

142
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,725
'Batman may not know I'm here..'

143
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:57,708
but he's about to.

144
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,710
Target locked on disabled craft, sir.

145
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:03,739
Whoever said lightning never strikes twice?

146
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,718
What now?

147
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:14,723
Uh, gremlins?

148
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,726
Slam crackle.

149
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,741
Heck of a place for an emergency landing.

150
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,757
Screech

151
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,757
zap

152
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:41,776
zap zap zap.

153
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:04,805
Bow to your emperor.

154
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,810
Welcome, Batman.

155
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,794
'Your reputation is mythic.'

156
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:16,818
But alas..

157
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,778
There is only room on New Olympus

158
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:21,824
for one legend.

159
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,825
Whirr.

160
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:32,799
'Attention, staff. I need a price check on kumquats.'

161
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,827
She's hacked into our system.

162
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:38,829
Our gremlin.

163
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,809
'Show yourself, Batgirl'

164
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,804
'and I shall reconsider dispatching your partner.'

165
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:46,817
Hmph. "Partner?"

166
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,826
That would suggest we actually

167
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,818
speak once in a while.

168
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:53,854
'You know, keep each other in the loop?'

169
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:57,860
Enough! He meets his end.

170
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,832
Oh, Maxie, you may wanna hold off on that.

171
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,830
If you ever wanna see your bolt-firing thingy again

172
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,834
over and out.

173
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,863
Search every level.

174
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,862
I want her found.

175
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,862
That ought to give Bats the space he needs to cut loose.

176
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,889
Monogrammed stockings. Janet speaking.

177
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,851
Can't you just once answer like a normal person?

178
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,855
'Well, I gotta be me, pop.'

179
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,860
I just wanted to make sure you made it home safe, Barb.

180
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,859
We've declared a citywide emergency.

181
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:37,863
'Then maybe we should keep the phone lines clear.'

182
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:39,882
'Love you, kisses.'

183
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:44,907
Erin's hair salon.

184
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,868
'Code names will do you no good'

185
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,886
as we have locked on to your frequency

186
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,911
'and triangulated your location.'

187
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:14,936
Ah!

188
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,921
Beep.

189
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:37,935
No sign of her.

190
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,922
Keep looking.

191
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:43,959
We must retrieve the master bolt transducer.

192
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:00,959
Well, well.

193
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:03,955
If it isn't the gremlin.

194
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,988
I will take the device.

195
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:15,993
You wouldn't dare.

196
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:21,994
Shatter It broke, Maxie.

197
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:26,001
Then I shall break you.

198
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:31,010
Zap zap.

199
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:41,004
And the name is Maximillian.

200
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,025
Zap.

201
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:57,021
Damage to antigrav unit. We're losing altitude.

202
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,015
'Abandon ship.'

203
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,048
'All hands to the escape pods.'

204
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,046
Cowards. I command you to stop.

205
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,037
Oh, Maxie, if the crew's jumping ship, who's driving?

206
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:37,046
It is the Fates who steer New Olympus

207
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,044
into the heart of Gotham.

208
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:41,057
Get to an escape pod.

209
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:44,075
Sorry, Bat, but I'm needed in the cockpit.

210
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,090
It's over, Zeus.

211
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,051
We need you to land this craft.

212
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:55,063
If I must fall from the heavens, Batman

213
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:58,081
then I shall take you with me.

214
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:11,105
Autopilot, huh? Won't be needing that.

215
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,124
Shatter shatter.

216
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:47,127
Batgirl.

217
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,150
Gotta steer this boat to a safe..

218
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,155
Harbor!

219
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,166
Whoosh.

220
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,159
Come on.

221
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:24,168
Nice landing.

222
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,150
The New Olympus?

223
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,150
'It's on its way to becoming'

224
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,174
'the new Atlantis.'

225
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,166
'She'll need work.'

226
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,175
EXP drives need tuning

227
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:42,180
and the fuel lines are waterlogged.

228
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:45,175
Thankfully, the Batgirl proved more durable

229
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:47,193
than the Batwing.

230
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:55,176
You're right, Alfred.

231
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,203
I think Batgirl's earned some wings of her own.

232
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,188
Where is the Batman?

233
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,216
Out of the loop, again.

234
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:10,215
What's that?

235
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:22,229
I'm in the loop.
