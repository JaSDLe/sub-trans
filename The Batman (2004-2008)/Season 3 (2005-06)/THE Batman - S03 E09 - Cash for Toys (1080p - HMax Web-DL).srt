1
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:07,996
'New from Krank Co.'

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,023
'The Cosmo Flyer!'

3
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,016
Awesome!

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,998
'With the Cosmo Flyer'

5
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:18,027
'the sky's the limit.'

6
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,033
'It's up, up, and away!'

7
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:27,007
For fim-foobley fun.

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,047
I can't think of a toy more fun for a child..

9
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:32,054
Or one more dangerous.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,053
Just ask Timmy Snyder.

11
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,027
'Or Reese Jones, who went on a wild ride'

12
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:45,033
over three counties before authorities could save him.

13
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:47,041
The Cosmo Flyer is yet another in a long line

14
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:49,043
of unsafe products from Krank Co.

15
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:52,075
The same people who brought us the Krank Bots..

16
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:56,043
'And the Zoom Pets..'

17
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,057
- Aah! - Aah!

18
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:01,042
Flame-retardant they weren't.

19
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,062
Today, I am happy to report that, thanks to the efforts

20
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:06,058
of Wayne Industries' Project Safety Net

21
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:08,059
the doors of Gotham-based Krank Co.

22
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,092
Have been permanently shut.

23
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,070
You thought my toys

24
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:21,094
were dangerous before, Wayne?

25
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:25,080
Krank?

26
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:28,067
Well, get a load of the new model.

27
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:31,111
It's doo-diddly deadly.

28
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:51,122
Beep

29
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:58,134
vroom

30
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,128
boom

31
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,136
vroom

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,161
clang

33
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:42,169
boom

34
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:47,178
whoosh whoosh.

35
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,170
Can Bruce come out and play?

36
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:07,184
No? Oh, he's buried under a building?

37
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,170
Aww.

38
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:11,177
You like playing with toys, Krank?

39
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,172
Try mine.

40
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:14,204
Swish.

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,224
Broke your toy. Boo-hoo!

42
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:25,214
Click click click.

43
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,187
Uhh!

44
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,197
Refill sold separately.

45
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,219
Uhh!

46
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,237
Vroom

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:47,248
whoosh.

48
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,249
Whoa! Dipsy doodles!

49
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,260
'Auto pilot on.'

50
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,264
whoosh

51
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,275
clang.

52
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,286
I own your weak bat butt!

53
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,284
'When Krank finds out you survived, Mr. Wayne'

54
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:52,284
he's sure to try again.

55
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:53,287
That's why I'm assigning you

56
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,278
around-the-clock police protection.

57
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,292
I really don't think that's necessary, commissioner.

58
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,286
It's not open for debate, Mr. Wayne.

59
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,279
I won't allow Gotham's favorite son

60
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:02,323
to be harmed on my watch.

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,296
Thank you, Commissioner Gordon.

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,307
Let me introduce you to your shadow.

63
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:12,327
Cash Tankenson, the last line of defense you'll ever need.

64
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:21,311
Hey, Freddy! How about some more of those nachos?

65
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:24,325
Extra jalapenos this time.

66
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,322
Straight away, detective shades.

67
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,308
Yo, Wayne, you're supposed to be

68
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,327
some kind of billionaire bachelor

69
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:34,315
so where's the par-tay?

70
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,334
The night is still young, detective.

71
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:40,328
Call me Cash, 'cause I'm not just your bodyguard, Wayne

72
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:42,330
I'm your wingman.

73
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,366
Yeah!

74
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,339
Cover for me, Alfred.

75
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,342
Time for the Batman to call a Krank

76
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:50,341
so we can send our houseguest home.

77
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:53,362
'Hey, Freddy! ETA on the nachos.'

78
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,358
Do hurry, sir.

79
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,376
Beep beep.

80
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:15,379
Let me guess. You're not expecting visitors.

81
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,401
Security breach.

82
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,403
Huh?

83
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,389
Special delivery.

84
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:37,376
No doubt from Cosmo Krank.

85
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,391
Looks like the Cos don't know.

86
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:41,386
Cash spent a year on bomb squad.

87
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,401
'No sign of a proximity fuse.'

88
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,393
'Amateur hour.'

89
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,412
Someone at the door, Alfred?

90
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:53,412
Stay back, Wayne. It's Cash Tankenson show now.

91
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:57,410
"Ding Dong, you're doo-diddle done!"

92
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:58,438
I don't get it.

93
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,427
Screech

94
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,454
swish swish.

95
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,438
Careful, sir.

96
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:23,426
Freddy's right. Leave the rough stuff to the professional.

97
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,456
Who ordered the knuckle sandwich?

98
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,460
Extra knuckles!

99
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,450
Huh?

100
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:37,457
Have another serving! Uhh!

101
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:45,482
Swish swish swish.

102
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:57,500
Uhh! Help! Uhh!

103
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,476
'Uhh! Get it off!'

104
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,493
It's payday.

105
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,472
Hyah!

106
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:08,508
Slam slam.

107
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,479
You got him.

108
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:15,482
Whew. Thanks, Cash. I owe you one.

109
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,520
Cash is as Cash does, man.

110
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,527
Dark night, isn't it?

111
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,530
I take your meaning, sir.

112
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,509
Uh, Master Bruce has an early meeting tomorrow.

113
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,502
Allow me to show you to the guest room.

114
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:33,727
That's not gonna work, Freddy.

115
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,499
Cash has to keep Wayne in his sights at all times.

116
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,539
We're roomies, pal.

117
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,502
Awesome.

118
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,513
And we just trashed a robot, <i>compadre.</i>

119
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,547
How can you be tired?

120
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,549
Cash is pumped and ready to party!

121
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,523
'Get down!'

122
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:03,544
Ah, I'm just doing my job, Mr. President.

123
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:08,569
Phew!

124
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:16,550
Sorry I'm late, commissioner.

125
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:17,555
Krank's made a second attempt

126
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,543
on Bruce Wayne's life tonight.

127
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,553
I have a man guarding him

128
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:22,555
but I could really use your help.

129
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,561
Let me keep an eye on Wayne instead.

130
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,551
I can catch Krank in the act.

131
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,562
No. Your talents are best used in the field.

132
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:29,591
We need to stop Krank...

133
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,588
Before he puts Wayne in danger again.

134
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,558
I'm on my way to Krank's factory, Alfred.

135
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:40,573
I'm hoping to find something the police missed.

136
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:44,569
Just buy me more time if Cash asks after me.

137
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:45,580
No worries there, sir.

138
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:48,593
Your wingman is sleeping like a baby.

139
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,577
Oh. Ahem. Hey, Wayne.

140
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,605
Which way to the john?

141
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:08,598
Okay, here we go. Let's see.

142
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,625
Ohh. Nah.

143
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:16,626
Um, occupied?

144
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:21,633
Oh. Uh, sorry, Freddy.

145
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:27,640
Phew.

146
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,646
Huh?

147
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:50,663
Pop.

148
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:15,669
Surprise, Batman!

149
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:18,693
Boom boom boom.

150
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:21,676
Ahh!

151
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,689
Crackle crackle.

152
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,683
You must think Cash is pretty dumb.

153
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:42,685
Thought you could pull the wool over Cash's eyes, huh?

154
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,687
That's a negative.

155
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,707
I know where you were.

156
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:54,719
You were out... partying.

157
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,705
You got me, Cash.

158
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:58,713
I don't know what to say, I...

159
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:00,718
Without your wingman.

160
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:05,717
You never, never leave your wingman.

161
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:09,708
You were sound asleep. I didn't wanna disturb you.

162
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,710
I don't let many people in, Wayne

163
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,716
but Cash has got feelings, too.

164
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,719
- Look, Cash... - It's Detective Tankenson!

165
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,753
Only my friends call me Cash.

166
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:29,751
From now on, Mr. Wayne, we do this by the book.

167
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,776
Look, detective, I am really sorry I ran out on you

168
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,748
but I'm just not used to...

169
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,744
Not used to having a babysitter?

170
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,740
Well, get used to it now.

171
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:45,772
I'd rather have a wingman, Detective Tankenson.

172
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:53,769
My friends call me Cash.

173
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:58,778
So, Cash, think we could, uh, lose these now?

174
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:06,770
You know, the commish is kind of jittery about you

175
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:11,771
being out in the open for this park dedication ceremony.

176
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,775
I refuse to let a madman dictate how I live my life.

177
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,783
And I'm hopin' Krank tries something

178
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,777
so I can see the look on his face

179
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,791
when I take him down hard!

180
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:24,804
Back seat, Freddy. Cash Tankenson always drives.

181
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,799
Are you certain this is a good idea, sir?

182
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:31,795
It's the only way, Alfred.

183
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,798
If I don't let Krank get to Bruce

184
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:36,821
the Batman doesn't get to Krank.

185
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:51,848
It's Krank! Look out!

186
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,822
Unh! Unh! Unh!

187
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:59,857
How 'bout we try on a pair of Cash Tankenson's size 13s?

188
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,828
My toy.

189
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:08,856
Oh. Uh... sorry, kid.

190
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,837
Little help?

191
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:14,862
Wayne?

192
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:17,869
Wayne!

193
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:24,873
Hey, Bruce Wayne, wanna go for a spin?

194
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:27,885
Come and get me, Krank.

195
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,861
Wayne!

196
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:34,896
Help!

197
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,901
Help! Help!

198
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:44,889
Wayne!

199
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:56,891
Drop Wayne or Cash drops you!

200
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,905
Whee-hee-hee!

201
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,920
Sorry, Cash. Have to rely on another wing man.

202
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,923
Crackle.

203
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,941
Police! I'm commandeering this vehicle!

204
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:58,974
No one shakes Cash Tankenson.

205
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:07,958
Welcome to Kranky Town, Wayne.

206
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:11,957
The play land children will never get to enjoy

207
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:14,968
all because of <i>you!</i>

208
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,964
Maybe my toys weren't the safest

209
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:20,964
but they were bim-boobly fun

210
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:24,996
and now you get to join my collection.

211
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:32,014
A little dip in my river of molten plastic and voila.

212
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:39,000
My very own limited-edition Bruce Wayne non-action figure.

213
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,999
What? Where's Wayne?

214
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:48,010
Safely on his way home.

215
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,994
Ooh!

216
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,005
Time to put your toys away.

217
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,037
Thud.

218
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:01,034
Freeze, toy geek!

219
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,009
The Batman? Uh, where's Wayne?

220
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:09,016
Safely on his way home, apparently

221
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,019
but not for long.

222
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:16,041
Beep rattle rattle rattle.

223
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,066
With both of you out of the way for good

224
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,038
who will protect Wayne, hmm?

225
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:32,065
Zoom Pets now come with extreme mangling action.

226
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,081
Here, kitty, kitty. Catnip time.

227
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,084
Splash

228
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,076
swish swish swish.

229
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,084
Hyah!

230
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:59,087
Ahh-nn-nh!

231
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,080
Got ya.

232
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:09,086
Who's got who?

233
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,080
Oh, no.

234
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,090
Whoa!

235
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:15,080
New from Krank Co.

236
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,119
Battle-damaged detective.

237
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:34,117
Oh, Batman, dipsy doodles?

238
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:42,107
Come on, now, you can't turn Cash into a candle.

239
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:44,146
I got my whole life ahead of me.

240
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,130
Who's gonna care for my grandma?

241
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,139
Aah! Oof!

242
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,144
Huh?

243
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:04,135
Ahh.

244
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,168
I'm done playing nice, Batman.

245
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,138
I.. Where, where.. Where's my remote?

246
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:14,170
Here's why your toys need warning labels.

247
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,168
Some of this? Let's go. What?

248
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,153
No! What-what are you doing?

249
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:31,177
No! Zoom Pets, you can't do this! I created you!

250
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,173
Uh, about the whole Cash beggin' for his life thing

251
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:42,194
uh, that never happened, right?

252
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:50,186
Detective, your assignment was to protect Bruce Wayne.

253
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,187
How do you explain Krank snatching him

254
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:55,180
from right under your nose? And where is Wayne?

255
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:56,187
Do you even know?

256
00:19:56,211 --> 00:20:00,200
Well, he's, uh, safely on his way home.

257
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:05,224
Actually, the detective had my back, commissioner.

258
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:10,193
Cash is as Cash does, sir.

259
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:14,222
I want your report on my desk first thing in the morning.

260
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:20,208
Hey, Wayne's a spoiled rich kid, but you, Bats, you're alright.

261
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,221
You need a wingman?

262
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,242
Hey!

263
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:31,252
That's cool. Cash prefers workin' alone.
