1
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:08,989
<i>Hey, me again, Barbara Gordon, sidekick hopeful</i>

2
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:11,992
<i>and commissioner's kid. Let's get you up to speed.</i>

3
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:15,034
<i>Proceed with your mission, Temblor.</i>

4
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,002
Third building Temblor's taken out this week

5
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:20,016
and we still can't nail a pattern.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,009
He's work-for-hire.

7
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:25,013
I just hope you're not out with Pamela Isley again.

8
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:26,049
<i>Pam's a bad seed.</i>

9
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,013
And don't even get me started on your whole

10
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:32,020
chloro-mulch-brand mutated super vegetables.

11
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:34,016
Barb, I'm concerned you're on your way

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,031
to blowing your shot at the Olympics.

13
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:38,020
<i>I have a new target for you.</i>

14
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:40,039
I want you to destroy

15
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:44,041
the corporate headquarters of Chlorogene.

16
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:47,029
Barb, law enforcement is dangerous work.

17
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,031
I don't want that life for you.

18
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:52,030
Batwave traced the messages to their source.

19
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:53,041
Pamela Isley.

20
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:55,051
Red, you have to stop this.

21
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,045
And here I thought we were two peas in a pod.

22
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,052
<i>Temblor wasn't too happy to find out</i>

23
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:03,084
<i>his boss was a teenybopper.</i>

24
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:08,077
The Batman. He is awesome.

25
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,053
Aah!

26
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:14,095
No!

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,099
<i>Catch all that?</i>

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,072
<i>We'll pop-quiz you later</i>

29
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:24,084
<i>'cause right now, things are about to get thorny.</i>

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,113
Huh?

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,129
Mmm.

32
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,236
We must have hit something.

33
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,220
U-uh, I didn't see a thing.

34
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:47,230
Hmm.

35
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,225
'Barb, it could've been you'

36
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,214
in the back of that ambulance tonight.

37
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,234
I know you wanted to help your friend

38
00:03:57,258 --> 00:04:00,227
but you need to leave police work to the police.

39
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,239
Is that what you tell the Batman?

40
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,241
T-the Bat's a special case.

41
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:09,230
- I mean, you can't compare.. - Probably him now.

42
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,237
Hello, commissioner. It's the Batman.

43
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,248
Care to go bowling?

44
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:15,254
Gordon. What?

45
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:18,248
You can't find Isley?

46
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:20,271
'I'm on my way.'

47
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:28,256
The Dark Knight has a green thumb?

48
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,282
This leave-behind is my only lead, Alfred.

49
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:37,300
And so far, it's definitely not garden variety.

50
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,313
Ah, aah!

51
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,303
Huh?

52
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,327
What's happening?

53
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:53,376
Pop's never gonna let me work in law enforcement.

54
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,377
Not after what happened tonight.

55
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:06,370
Guess it's back to gymnastics.

56
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,348
Unless..

57
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,359
Mild-mannered Olympic hero by day

58
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:14,358
butt-kicking Batwoman by night.

59
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:17,386
"Who is that masked woman." The commissioner wonders.

60
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:25,369
Whoa.

61
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:28,368
Sit. Uh, uh, stay.

62
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,383
No, wait. You're a plant.

63
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,389
Don't do anything.

64
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:34,401
Aah!

65
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:40,414
Prepare to suffer the wrath of mother nature.

66
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:48,414
Destroy her.

67
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:55,414
Psych.

68
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:59,413
- What's up, Red? - Pam?

69
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:02,420
- What happened to you? - Just a fab makeover.

70
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:04,418
Green is the new red

71
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,416
and I'm gonna use my powers

72
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,421
to avenge crimes against nature.

73
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:12,427
We can do it together, Red, the two of us

74
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:16,433
and I'm betting Chlorogene will listen to me this time.

75
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,434
Hey, sounds great.

76
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,431
Except for the fact that you're a plant.

77
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:25,459
Ivy, to be exact, poison ivy.

78
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,460
Think about it, Red.

79
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,473
I gotta call dad.

80
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,448
No, wait.

81
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,478
She'll just wind up behind bars.

82
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:46,469
I have to be the one to help Pam without dad knowing.

83
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:50,472
But I can't do it alone.

84
00:07:57,481 --> 00:08:00,475
The Batsignal isn't a toy, Miss Gordon.

85
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:04,471
Didn't have your cell number. But this is urgent.

86
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:05,480
Pam Isley came to see me

87
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,486
but she's calling herself Poison Ivy now

88
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,479
and, well, how do I put this?

89
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,513
She was part plant.

90
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:20,491
- It all fits. - It does?

91
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,491
A plant particle I found at the scene of Pamela's disappearance

92
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,490
contained traces of steroids made by Chlorogene.

93
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:29,531
When Pamela was contaminated, her biochemistry was altered.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,504
Then come on. Let's save Pam.

95
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:35,511
I'll do everything in my power to help your friend, Barbara.

96
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,527
What? Look, wait a minute.

97
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,527
But you haven't even seen my costume.

98
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,538
Huh?

99
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:56,557
Aah!

100
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,531
Police.

101
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:09,546
Tonight marks the end of an era for Chlorogene.

102
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,555
So get ready because it's hostile takeover time.

103
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,569
Consider the fate of Chlorogene a warning, Gotham.

104
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,572
Mother nature just got herself some muscle.

105
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:41,566
Pamela, you're not well.

106
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,567
- Let me help you. - Batman.

107
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:48,602
Thanks, but I have all the help I need.

108
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:09,611
Batman, look out!

109
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,615
Hiya.

110
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,619
A Batgirl. Hmm.

111
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:23,601
Who knew you had a sidekick?

112
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,615
- I don't. - FYI, it's Batwoman.

113
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,635
Either way, you're bat meat.

114
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:34,630
Ivy, time to give up.

115
00:10:34,654 --> 00:10:37,621
Tried that. She's not interested.

116
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:40,641
Maybe she'll be interested in this.

117
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,636
Nice aim.

118
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,670
I'll be practicing that.

119
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,641
Your friend still has lots to learn, Batman.

120
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:53,645
Teach her how to survive a fall yet?

121
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,669
Whoa!

122
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,656
Whoa.

123
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,649
You're good at this.

124
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,680
No time to babysit.

125
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:14,697
Gone.

126
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,681
Okay, here goes nothing.

127
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,675
Let me make myself clear.

128
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,678
There's no room for a Batgirl in Gotham.

129
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,683
That's cool because it's Batwoman

130
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,684
as in I'm a grown woman and don't need to listen to you.

131
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,679
Then for your own safety, if you won't listen to me

132
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:40,707
I'm gonna have to tell your father, Miss Gordon.

133
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:45,705
Uh, you must have me confused with someone else.

134
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,692
Oh, dude.

135
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,732
You just broke the superhero secret identity code.

136
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,757
Evening, commish.

137
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,736
Pamela?

138
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,734
What do you think you're doing?

139
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:24,722
'Trying to make the world a better place'

140
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,750
for plants.

141
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:46,765
Let go of me.

142
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:49,776
As you command.

143
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:54,793
Magic spores.

144
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,799
'Mother nature's mind control.'

145
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,770
- A little help here. - Of course.

146
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,792
Up you go.

147
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:13,815
Freeze, Pamela. It doesn't have to be this way.

148
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,815
Actually, commish, it does.

149
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:25,785
Because the only law Poison Ivy answers to

150
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,829
is the law of the jungle.

151
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,815
A Batgirl, sir?

152
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,808
Perhaps I should equip the Batcave with a doggy door

153
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,820
should Bathound decide to join the gang.

154
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:50,812
Barbara doesn't know what she's getting herself into, Alfred.

155
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,832
I'm gonna have to tell her father.

156
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,825
The Batwave reports that James Gordon

157
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,860
'has just been kidnapped by Poison Ivy.'

158
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,865
Isn't nature fascinating, jimbo?

159
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,879
For instance, all that struggling you're doing there

160
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,858
'that lets this carnivorous plant'

161
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:22,859
'know it's captured food.'

162
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:25,886
Hmm. Let me show you.

163
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,883
Mmm. Cool, huh?

164
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:38,877
<i>Some first day as a sidekick.</i>

165
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,875
<i>I failed to stop Ivy.</i>

166
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,905
<i>My aim needs work.</i>

167
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,882
<i>And I blew my secret identity.</i>

168
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:47,910
<i>As I wondered whether or not I should quit</i>

169
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,912
<i>my crime-fighting career</i>

170
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,887
<i>my world got rocked again.</i>

171
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,881
Breaking news, Police Commissioner Gordon

172
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:58,066
was abducted a short time ago

173
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,923
by a new supervillain calling herself Poison Ivy.

174
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,895
No word on whether or not..

175
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,911
Dad.

176
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,923
I'll quit tomorrow.

177
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,964
Batman, it's a trap. Mm.

178
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,968
'Well, well, a weed in the garden.'

179
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:59,966
Whack it, boys.

180
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,968
<i>No, you're not experiencing deja vu.</i>

181
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:20,978
<i>This is where we began and if you remember.</i>

182
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:23,975
<i>Ivy used her mind control mojo on Batman.</i>

183
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,007
<i>I made my triumphant return as Batgirl</i>

184
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,983
<i>so I could rescue pop and then the big bat</i>

185
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,987
<i>was asked to eliminate his favorite sidekick.</i>

186
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,972
<i>So now that you know how I got into this mess</i>

187
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:37,006
<i>the question becomes how do I get out?</i>

188
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:44,018
Think I need to knock some sense back into him.

189
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,007
Hello. Remember me, plucky sidekick?

190
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:59,013
- Sidekick, huh? - And he's back.

191
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:01,018
He's back just in time

192
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:05,036
to witness the commissioner become plant food.

193
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,039
Dad.

194
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:17,036
- I'll get the commissioner. - No, wait.

195
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,050
Huh?

196
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,069
Amateur.

197
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:39,080
Come on. Focus.

198
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,086
Bull's eye.

199
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,068
All in the wrist.

200
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,071
- 'Ivy.' - Huh?

201
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,087
Catch.

202
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,100
Hiya.

203
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:19,116
Mow 'em down!

204
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,118
Can't ice me if you can't hit me.

205
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,147
Whoa!

206
00:18:56,154 --> 00:19:00,144
Ohh! Aah! Aah!

207
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:12,174
The thing about plants, love water.

208
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,173
'Missed me.'

209
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:29,178
No!

210
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:47,181
I, uh, owe you my thanks, Batgirl.

211
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:49,178
It's Batwo..

212
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:52,201
Forget it. Batgirl it is.

213
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:00,187
Okay then. Gotta go.

214
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:03,216
Uh, you take care now, citizen.

215
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:10,231
Another Red? Huh, what're the chances?

216
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:20,209
So still plan on telling my dad?

217
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,203
Not every child gets the opportunity

218
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:25,209
to rescue their parent.

219
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,243
I'm sure he'd be grateful if you decided to tell him.

220
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,228
I'll take that as a no.

221
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:38,215
<i>As you can see, everything ended quite nicely.</i>

222
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,232
<i>Well, maybe ended isn't the right word</i>

223
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:44,232
<i>because this, my friends, is only the beginning.</i>

224
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,245
Whoo!
