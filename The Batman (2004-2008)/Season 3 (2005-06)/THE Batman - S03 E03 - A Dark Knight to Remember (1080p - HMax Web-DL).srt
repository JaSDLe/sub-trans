1
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:09,004
Ever since bat breath got that signal

2
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:11,997
my lead time's been chopped in half.

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,001
Hurry, ladies, hurry!

4
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:18,025
That's it. Put your backs into it!

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,014
'Careful!'

6
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:22,044
'That Penguin's pure crystal.'

7
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:27,037
whoosh What's that?

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,016
Oh, no.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,030
The statue, Penguin.

10
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,032
Give it up.

11
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,030
Actually it would be more fun

12
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:38,043
if he makes us take it from him.

13
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:47,036
Don't look so surprised. You knew I'd be back.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,049
'I heard you got some backup, Batman'

15
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:55,040
but no one told me it was your baby sister!

16
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,052
Waa ha ha ha ha ha!

17
00:00:57,076 --> 00:01:00,062
Chop 'em into chum!

18
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,085
Aah!

19
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:20,083
Waa ha ha ha ha!

20
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,092
Whoa.

21
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:36,101
When do I get one?

22
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,101
Watch them.

23
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,114
Swoosh.

24
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:49,115
You get to do all the fun stuff.

25
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:13,135
Alright. Keep the statue.

26
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,139
Batman.

27
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:30,164
Waa ha ha ha ha!

28
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:21,221
Swoosh.

29
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,250
Yes, he's alright.

30
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,240
It's just you and me, girls.

31
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,278
Huh?

32
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:21,266
No.

33
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:31,294
'Master Bruce.'

34
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,294
- Alfred? - Ah, you know my name.

35
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,322
Then it would seem that nasty bump

36
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,283
has caused no memory loss.

37
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,285
What happened?

38
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,289
Virtually no memory loss.

39
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:09,296
I'm afraid that your latest nocturnal escapade

40
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,304
went somewhat awry, Master Bruce

41
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:14,301
but some bed rest shall do you good.

42
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:15,338
No. No can do, Alfred.

43
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,303
It'll be dark soon and, well, you know me.

44
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,300
I can't wait to tackle the night.

45
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:24,314
Ah, yes, yes. The night which belongs to The Batman.

46
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,339
The Batman?

47
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,342
The night belongs to Bruce Wayne.

48
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,334
I'd know that look of yours anywhere, pop.

49
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:48,368
'You're about to raise the roof on this place.'

50
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:54,336
So, commissioner, this must be your lovely daughter.

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,337
Brucie! Where have you been hiding?

52
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:58,376
Ha. Got to run.

53
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:02,350
Bruce Wayne, he's the man.

54
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:04,384
I'll get us some punch, Barb.

55
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,381
Bruce Wayne is the man.

56
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,362
Muscles on his muscles

57
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,390
rich enough to finance all his gadgets..

58
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:18,362
'...and has a jaw I'd know anywhere.'

59
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:22,402
Brucie, you are so totally The Batman.

60
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:29,403
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Gotham music awards.

61
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,378
'The next band soared to success'

62
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:37,378
'with six gold records.'

63
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:39,388
Give it up for..

64
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,416
"Ozzy and the Cobblepots?"

65
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,416
♪ Oh yeah ♪

66
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:54,406
Penguin.

67
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,402
Alright, Bruce.

68
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,426
Showtime.

69
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,417
Crash.

70
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:05,431
You know, I prefer a captive audience!

71
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,455
'Cash, gold, jewelry..'

72
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:19,443
your money's all good here.

73
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,427
I hope the Batman shows.

74
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,447
So do I.

75
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,465
Don't tell me you're gonna change under here?

76
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,449
Let's not play hero, commissioner.

77
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:42,451
I'll leave that to the Batman.

78
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:46,449
Bat Guano won't be showing up tonight.

79
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:48,467
Or ever again.

80
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:51,451
Yeah, right.

81
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,471
- What? - That's right, Gordy.

82
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:56,498
I personally took care of him.

83
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,503
'Hello.'

84
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,475
Well, well, well.

85
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,508
If it isn't my old pal Bruce Wayne.

86
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,515
Click Huh?

87
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:23,525
Forget that junk!

88
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,494
'We've got Wayne'

89
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,502
the human piggy bank!

90
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:32,512
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

91
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,540
Swoosh.

92
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,535
Okay, so maybe he's not The Batman.

93
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:58,537
Sorry, hon, duty calls.

94
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:01,527
Now, as soon as those doors open what are you gonna do?

95
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,529
Go home, lock up and wait till I hear from you.

96
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:05,559
Good girl.

97
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,547
Penguin's ride had to leave a heat trail

98
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:25,554
and with a few items from

99
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,586
Barbara Gordon's photography class.

100
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,576
Voila.

101
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:36,574
'Huh?'

102
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:40,601
caw caw caw caw Aah!

103
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:47,583
Don't you just love Gotham zoo at night?

104
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,582
No crowds.

105
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:50,586
Clink.

106
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,586
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

107
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,590
Name your price, Penguin.

108
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:55,573
I'll cut you a check.

109
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,575
One with lots and lots of zeros.

110
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:01,606
Oh, that's very reasonable of you, Wayne.

111
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:14,599
How do I know this is good?

112
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:15,608
I need to see some I.D.

113
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,598
Maybe Wayne didn't have his costume handy

114
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:21,611
but he's got to bust out with some butt kick now.

115
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:23,602
So you'll let me go?

116
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,622
Ah, yeah, about that.

117
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:27,631
I lied!

118
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,617
Huh?

119
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:35,650
The Bat-brat!

120
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:42,659
Oh, ladies.

121
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,653
Ahh. Hurry, Mr. Wayne.

122
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:14,692
Get yourself to..

123
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,694
Safety.

124
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:22,688
I thought he was The Batman?

125
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,684
Wayne's no loss

126
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,675
not when I have the chance to exterminate

127
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,699
this town's bat population once and for all!

128
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:42,704
Waa ha ha ha ha ha!

129
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,725
You just left behind the kid who saved you.

130
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,731
Bruce, you're a coward.

131
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,722
'Gotham police.'

132
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,712
It's been two hours.

133
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:11,747
Shut it off.

134
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,725
Sir, I'm a bit perplexed

135
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,735
as to why you did not summon your other car.

136
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,741
And why did you not trounce that troll

137
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,729
when he crashed the event in the first place?

138
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,729
Because he's a homicidal troll, Alfred?

139
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,743
And how, I ask, is that different from the garbage.

140
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,737
The Batman faces every night?

141
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:38,738
Well, unfortunately The Batman wasn't at the party

142
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:39,749
so I couldn't ask him.

143
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,754
I mean, what was I supposed to do

144
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,781
take Penguin out with my golf swing?

145
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:46,758
Oh, dear.

146
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,779
Your accident.

147
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:52,791
'We must return to the mansion at once.'

148
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,782
They say that seeing is believing, Master Bruce.

149
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,791
Whoa.

150
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:09,794
The Batcave.

151
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:17,785
How did all this get down here?

152
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,797
You built it, sir.

153
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,798
Well, that-that, that's ridiculous.

154
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:24,798
I'm wealthy. I run a successful company. I..

155
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,805
Why would I wanna go out at night..

156
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,809
Dressed..

157
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:33,808
Like a bat?

158
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:36,829
Because you have a need to save people.

159
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,807
No. No. Not me.

160
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:41,819
I'm not a hero.

161
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,820
I don't have that kind of courage.

162
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:46,807
Your courage seems to have gone missing

163
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,839
with your memory of the Bat.

164
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:51,854
This just in.

165
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,819
Mmm! Penguin here.

166
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:59,831
With a warning to any future bats in training.

167
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:04,825
I started the week by getting rid of The Batman.

168
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:07,838
And now I'm finishing it by doing the same

169
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:10,829
'to the Batgirl.'

170
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:13,833
So tune in at the stroke of midnight

171
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:15,849
for the final chapter of

172
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:18,880
the beak beats the Bat!

173
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,880
Waa ha ha ha ha!

174
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:33,858
Master Bruce, it's the clock

175
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:36,855
at the Salty Bird Sardine company.

176
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,867
Sir, I do not know how else to put this.

177
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,864
The Batgirl is counting on you.

178
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:44,905
Perhaps it is time to regain your courage.

179
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:50,902
'Perhaps it is time to channel your inner bat.'

180
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:03,899
clank No. Sorry.

181
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:05,914
Not feelin' it.

182
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:08,931
'Sir!'

183
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,916
'Jolly good reflexes.'

184
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,915
Alfred, h-how did I..

185
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:22,924
Apparently your inner bat is just aching to fly out.

186
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:32,951
'Hopefully this will be like riding a bicycle.'

187
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,938
'Observe, my dear.'

188
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:41,957
'An ostrich egg.'

189
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:45,927
Hard as bone.

190
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:46,966
Waa ha ha.

191
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,956
Gong

192
00:15:56,972 --> 00:16:01,974
cuckoo

193
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,973
splat Huh.

194
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,985
Heh..

195
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,971
'Waa ha ha ha ha ha!'

196
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,001
'Tie her up, ladies!'

197
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:38,020
Inner bat, do your thing.

198
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:47,989
Batman? You're supposed to be pushin' up clams.

199
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:50,004
Well, if he's here to save Batgirl

200
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:52,023
it's too late.

201
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,044
Whoa.

202
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,039
Uh-oh.

203
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:22,049
Huh!

204
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,049
Unh! Uh! Ya!

205
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,071
I'm guess those weren't the smoke pellets.

206
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,101
Gong.

207
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,074
Wa ha ha ha ha ha!

208
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:23,117
Cuckoo.

209
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:30,097
Hurry, Batman. You're about to have three sidekicks.

210
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,106
Ha ha ha ha!

211
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,137
Yeah! What kind of hero are you anyway?

212
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,139
<i>You're a coward.</i>

213
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,118
Ha ha ha ha ha!

214
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:45,127
<i>Regain your courage.</i>

215
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,122
Ha ha ha ha ha!

216
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:52,138
<i>What kind of hero are you anyway?</i>

217
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:56,138
Smack.

218
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,155
Like riding a bicycle.

219
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:19,155
So that's what took you so long?

220
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,161
You rode your bike?

221
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,186
Oh, no.

222
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,207
Oh! Uh!

223
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,193
Huh?

224
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:04,213
Get this cuckoo to Arkham where he belongs.

225
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:12,192
At least you didn't turn out to be Bruce Wayne.

226
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:15,214
Dude needs to invest in a serious spine.

227
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,224
I try not to judge.

228
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,217
Just tell me that one day

229
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:23,213
I'll get to meet the man behind the Bat.

230
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:26,225
Who says I'm a man?
